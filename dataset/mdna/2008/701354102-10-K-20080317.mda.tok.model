part i item business parkervision  inc the company or we was incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august  we are in the business of designing  developing and licensing our proprietary dp and dd wireless radio frequency rf technologies for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless radio applications 
our primary business strategy is to license our technologies to chip suppliers and or mobile handset manufacturers for the incorporation of our technologies into mobile handsets 
in addition  we have  from time to time  explored licensing and other opportunities outside the cellular industry to the extent that the applications are synergistic with our current development efforts 
recent developments initial customer agreements in  we entered into agreements for the incorporation of our technologies into rf products 
in may  we executed an engineering services agreement and a licensing agreement with itt corporation itt for the design and use of our dp technology in applications worldwide 
under the agreements  we will be paid royalties on a per unit basis for products sold by itt that incorporate our dp technology 
we are also providing engineering consulting and design services to itt on a time and materials basis  as requested  for the development of products using our technology 
in december  we entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with a mobile handset chip supplier for the design and use of our dp and dd technologies in chipsets initially targeted for the g mobile handset market worldwide 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be paid royalties on a per unit basis for chipsets sold which incorporate one or both of our rf technologies 
sale of equity securities to fund operations on march   we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to a limited number of domestic institutional and other investors in a private placement transaction pursuant to an offering exemption under the securities act of such shares represent of our outstanding common stock on an after issued basis 
 shares were sold at a price of per share  and  shares were sold to mr 
jeffrey parker  our chief executive officer and chairman  at per share 
the net proceeds from this transaction of approximately million will be used for general working capital purposes 
we will register the common stock issued in the private offering for re offer and re sale by the investors 
general development of business from through june of  we manufactured and sold branded wireless networking products that incorporated our dd technology 
our product sales were primarily through retail and internet retail distribution channels 
all of our product revenues through were generated from these retail products 
in june  we exited our manufacturing and retail sales activities in pursuit of our longer term business strategy of establishing relationships with original equipment manufacturers oems for the incorporation of our technology into their products 
our decision to exit the retail activities was precipitated by advances in our wireless technology resulting in increased interest from oem prospects  specifically in the mobile handset market 
we determined that the investment required to increase brand awareness  introduce new product offerings  and expand the distribution channel for retail products  would detract from our ability to capitalize on oem opportunities 
as of december   we had substantially completed our retail exit activities 
those activities included the sale of our remaining finished product inventories  including those reclaimed from our retail and distribution channel partners  and liquidation of our remaining raw materials inventory  our manufacturing and prototype assets and other property and equipment utilized in the retail business 
in the second half of  we began educating prospective customers about the benefits of our technologies  with a focus on our dp transmit technology 
in  we completed our first dp integrated circuit ic which embodied many of the advancements of our technology and enabled us to begin demonstrating partially integrated prototypes 
throughout and  we continued to further advance our prototype ics while cultivating potential customer relationships 
our sales related activities in and included prototype demonstrations of our increasingly integrated dp platform  support of in depth technical due diligence by prospective customers  analysis of prospective customer product plans  delivery of initial proposals and terms  and  ultimately  negotiations of proposed business relationships 
our initial target customer base was limited to top tier mobile handset manufacturers 
however  in and increasingly in  mobile handset manufacturers were shifting rf innovation and developments to their chipset providers 
accordingly  we expanded our target customer base to include not only the mobile handset manufacturers  but also their component suppliers 
in addition  we expanded our market awareness campaign to include network providers who are significant influencers to the oems in the mobile handset industry 
although our primary target market is the mobile handset industry  we have explored potential relationships outside this target market to the extent that the requirements of the prospective customers are in concert with the needs of our primary target market 
this exploration resulted in our first license agreement  with itt corporation in may to date  we have generated no royalty revenue from licensing of our wireless rf technologies 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and expand our market opportunities through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers such that we are able to secure a reasonable share of the market 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  mobile handset market and generations that are likely to evolve beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
current industry studies indicate that over billion g handsets are expected to ship in the year  which represents approximately percent of the total mobile handset market 
technology and products our wireless technologies  collectively referred to as energy signal processing or esp  represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
the technology applies to the transmit baseband data to an rf carrier signal and receive rf carrier signal to baseband data functions of a radio transceiver 
the transmit portion of the technology is called directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a digital baseband signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
the receiver portion of the technology is called directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to baseband data signal 
although our primary sales efforts have been focused on commercialization of our dp technology solutions  our first customer in the mobile handset industry has licensed both the dp and dd solutions 
we have completed several engineering prototypes of our dp based ics targeted at mobile handset applications 
these ics were produced using a silicon germanium sige process through a fabrication relationship with ibm microelectronics ibm 
these ics are utilized to verify that our technology can be highly integrated in silicon and to demonstrate the benefits of the technology to oem target customers 
the portion of the ic that embodies the core rf technology has been highly integrated in prototype ics 
we anticipate that oem customers will engage us to customize the implementation of the core technology based on their specific interface and product requirements 
our current prototypes support multi band meaning multiple frequencies and multi mode meaning multiple cellular standards and corresponding modulation formats functionality 
our ics support multiple bands of cellular and pcs frequencies and support the current and emerging cellular standards including gsm edge  cdma  w cdma  and hsupa 
we are also able to demonstrate e wimax standards using pcs frequencies with our current ics 
our dd receiver technology was first introduced in the form of transceiver ics for the wireless local area networking wlan market in in  we began marketing ics to oems and original design manufacturers odm s who manufacture and sell wlan products or application modules that incorporate wlan capabilities 
in order to mitigate the barriers to entry in the wlan marketplace  we also initiated a business strategy of developing our own dd based wlan products for marketing to end users 
from to  we produced wlan products for retail distribution 
in june  we ceased production and development efforts for our wlan end user products and exited our retail business activities in order to focus exclusively on oem opportunities  particularly with regard to our transmit technology implementation which we believe has broad adoption potential in the mobile handset market 
our unique technologies process the rf waveform in a more optimal manner than existing technologies  thereby allowing oems to create handsets that have extended battery life  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technologies provide such attractive benefits  in part  because of the unique integrated circuit architecture which enables efficient digital circuit processing  eliminating many of the limitations of legacy analog processing 
marketing and sales our marketing and sales activities are currently focused on developing and capitalizing on relationships in the mobile handset industry 
although we believe our direct customers are likely to be the chipset suppliers in this industry  we continue to cultivate our relationships with the mobile handset manufacturers who are significant influencers to their chipset suppliers 
our sales and sales support activities include prototype demonstrations of both semi integrated and highly integrated circuits that showcase the benefits of the technology  support of detailed technology due diligence discussions and testing  analysis of potential customer product roadmaps and integration alternatives  and negotiations of specific terms of potential business relationships 
we believe the sales cycle  from the initial customer meeting to the consummation of a business arrangement  is generally months 
the length of the sales cycle is a result of many factors  including the unique nature of our technology  intense technology evaluation and due diligence required based on the complex nature of radio frequency technology  in general  and the cellular specifications  in particular  our lack of tenure in the cellular industry  and the variety of licensing implementations and integration decisions that must be evaluated by the customer in order to assess the specific value proposition for their needs 
we believe the sales cycle will be significantly shortened as our technologies gain adoption in this market 
we executed our first two customer contracts in we believe additional customer design wins will occur and  furthermore  we believe that the rate of adoption of our technology will increase as we move toward completion of products with our existing customers 
future sales may be influenced by the terms negotiated with our customers and our ability to expand internal resources to support multiple customers 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our technologies  which are currently being marketed in the mobile handset industry  face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers and power amplifiers including companies such as rf microdevices  anadigics  skyworks  st microelectronics  qualcomm  and freescale  among others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a licensee of our technologies 
we also compete against rf engineering groups within the research and development organizations of our target customers 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
we believe we can gain adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance and cost advantages enabled by our unique circuit architecture  as supported by a solid and defensible intellectual property portfolio 
our intellectual property offering is capable of being compliant with mobile standards based g requirements and can accept the same baseband data input as traditional or future offerings 
in addition  we believe the improved power efficiencies enabled by our technology provide a solution to an existing problem in applications for g standards and beyond that the mobile handset industry is seeking to solve 
production and supply our current business strategy is focused on licensing our intellectual property 
as a result  we expect that production capacity risk will shift to our customers 
we currently have a fabrication relationship with ibm for the production of our prototype ics on a sige process 
we believe ibm has sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our ics can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
patents and trademarks we consider our intellectual property  including patents  patent applications  trademarks  and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
as of december   we have obtained us and foreign patents related to our rf technologies and have patent applications pending in the united states and other countries 
our patents have been issuing at a rate of approximately four to six new patents each quarter 
since december   we have been granted four additional u 
s patents and one additional foreign patent 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years 
research and development for the years ended december   and  we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
our research and development efforts have been devoted to the development and advancement of rf technologies  including the development of prototype ics for proof of concept purposes 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development  in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was million 
the net loss for was million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for our intellectual property and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in the near term will not bring the company to profitability 
if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time and the sale of our video division in we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing and general operations 
our current capital resources  including cash and cash equivalents at december  of million and the net proceeds of our march  private placement transaction of approximately million  are expected to sustain operations through the first quarter of  if not longer 
thereafter  unless we increase revenues to a level that they cover operating expenses or we reduce costs  we will require additional capital to fund these expenses 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current stockholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding or reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  in fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our future business continuation will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
in addition  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as rf microdevices  anadigics  skyworks  st microelectronics  qualcomm  and freescale  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our intellectual property into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of the business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we rely  in large part  on the ability of key customers to successfully develop and sell products incorporating our technologies  the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business opportunities 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend  in part  on the success and timing of our customer s product development and sales activities which may be impacted by factors outside of our control 
delays in or failure of our customers product development or sales activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer whose services  if lost  would have an adverse impact on our leadership  industry perception  and investor perception about our future 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of the services of mr 
parker might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors may experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we do not currently have an employment agreement with mr 
parker 
we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract or retain highly skilled employees we will not be able to execute our research and development plans or provide the highly technical services that our products require 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized employees to conduct our research  development and customer support activities 
the inability to obtain or retain these specialized employees will have an adverse impact on our business development because customers will not obtain the information or services expected which may prevent us from successfully implementing our current business plans 
the outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  exercisable options and warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock  assuming no terminations or forfeitures of such options and warrants 
on december  and  respectively  there will be  and  currently exercisable options and warrants assuming no new grants  exercises  terminations or forfeitures 
all of the underlying common stock of these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current stockholders ownership 
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of stockholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from stockholders to a vote by all the stockholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the stockholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some stockholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the stockholders

our primary business strategy is to license our technologies to chip suppliers and or mobile handset manufacturers for the incorporation of our technologies into mobile handsets 
in addition  we have  from time to time  explored licensing and other opportunities outside the cellular industry to the extent that the applications are synergistic with our current development efforts 
in  we entered into the first agreements for the incorporation of our technologies into rf products 
in may  we executed an engineering services agreement and a licensing agreement with itt for the design and use of our dp technology in applications worldwide 
under the agreements  we will be paid royalties on a per unit basis for products sold by itt that incorporate our dp technology 
we are also providing engineering consulting and design services to itt on a time and materials basis  as requested  for the development of products using our technology 
in december  we entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with a mobile handset chip supplier for the design and use of our dp and dd technologies in chipsets initially targeted for the g mobile handset market worldwide 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be paid royalties on a per unit basis for chipsets sold which incorporate one or both of our rf technologies 
to date  we have generated no royalty revenue from licensing of our wireless rf technologies and only limited revenue from engineering design services 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and expand our market opportunities through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
although design cycles will vary from customer to customer  we believe the timeframe from consummation of the business arrangement to recognition of royalty revenue from product shipments will range from months 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  mobile handset market and generations that are likely to evolve beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
we have made significant investments in developing our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
since we have not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset our operating expenses  we have used the proceeds largely from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
we intend to continue to use our working capital to support future marketing  sales  research and development and general operations 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in revenues  new products  or technological advances or that we have adequate capital to complete our products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital 
exit from retail business activities in june  we exited our manufacturing and retail sales activities in pursuit of our longer term business strategy of establishing relationships with original equipment manufacturers oems for the incorporation of our technology into their products 
our decision to exit the retail activities was precipitated by advances in our wireless technology resulting in increased interest from oem prospects  specifically in the mobile handset market 
we determined that the investment required to increase brand awareness  introduce new product offerings  and expand the distribution channel for retail products  would detract from our ability to capitalize on oem opportunities 
exiting the retail business resulted in charges to our operating results of approximately million 
as of december   we had substantially completed our retail exit activities 
those activities included the sale of our remaining finished product inventories  including those reclaimed from our retail and distribution channel partners  and liquidation of our remaining raw materials inventory  our manufacturing and prototype assets and other property and equipment utilized in the retail business 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our consolidated financial statements use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the more significant estimates made by management include the volatility  risk free interest rate  forfeiture rate and estimated lives of share based awards used in the estimate of the fair market value of share based compensation  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets and amortization period for intangible and long lived assets  and the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
actual results could differ from the estimates made 
management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for continued reasonableness 
appropriate adjustments  if any  to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation 
intangible assets patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from three to twenty years 
management evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  fas r which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by fas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized after adoption includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas and b share based expense for all awards granted or modified subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
further  as required under fasr  we estimate forfeitures for options granted which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation expense 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp fas r 
fsp fas r provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in fasr 
fasr requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting fasr termed the apic pool  assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by sfas no 
we have elected to use the shortcut method under fsp fas r to calculate our apic pool 
revenue recognition we account for service revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and aicpa statement of position no 
sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the provisions of sab and sop  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for cost reimbursement type contracts which specify a certain billable fee amount 
revenues are recognized as costs are incurred assuming that collection is reasonably assured 
our cost of sales includes the direct labor costs of engineering staff providing services under these contracts  as well as indirect costs including depreciation and amortization and allocated facilities costs 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we did not recognize any product revenue in or our product revenue relates primarily to products sold through retail distribution channels  with limited sales direct to end users through our own website and direct value added resellers 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on loss before taxes as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
in addition  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on january   as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements 
sfas does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements  but standardizes its definition and guidance in gaap 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas on january  we have evaluated sfas and do not anticipate that it will have an impact on our financial statements when adopted

results of operations for each of the years ended december   and revenues revenue for the year ended december  of approximately  represented revenue from services provided to itt under the engineering services agreement entered into in may these services included analysis and evaluation of architectural design alternatives for incorporation of our dp technology into rf circuits based on various product specifications provided by itt 
itt is utilizing that information to establish their product development plans for incorporation of the dp technology 
we anticipate that itt will select a product development program that utilizes their internal resources  as needed  to design circuits based on our existing commercial prototype designs 
as such  we currently do not anticipate any significant engineering services revenue from itt during their initial product design cycle 
we believe utilization of our commercial prototype designs will enable a faster product launch for itt than would be expected if they had selected a program that involved a fully customized dp design 
we also continue to be engaged with itt in reviewing various longer term product applications for our technology 
based on the established royalty rates and other contract terms  as well as our understanding of itt s product plans  we currently estimate that we will achieve cumulative royalties under our agreement with itt of approximately million 
we also anticipate that royalties from our mobile handset chip customer will range from approximately million to million in the first full year of shipments depending upon the customer s product mix and unit volume as well as the timing of incorporation of the dd receiver technology into products 
we also believe the opportunity exists to significantly expand our royalty revenue from this customer based on the expected growth of the market in which their products are targeted  additional product applications for our technology which are contemplated in the agreement and our customer s ability to capture greater share of market for their products 
we believe the initial ics incorporating our technology will be completed in late we will collect royalties upon the sale of chipsets by our customer to the mobile handset providers who will then incorporate the chipset into mobile products 
we believe we will achieve additional design wins in the mobile handset market which will expand our future revenue opportunities both for royalties and engineering services 
we had no revenues for the year ended december  and our product revenue of approximately  represented revenue from sales of wireless consumer products through retail channels 
revenue for the period ended december  was net of an allowance recovery for sales returns of approximately 
gross revenue was also reduced for price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative marketing costs deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force  eitf issue  to derive net revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  included cooperative marketing costs of approximately  gross margin the gross margins for products and services for the years ended december  and were as follows engineering services products total our gross margin in is approximately of service revenue and represents margin on services provided to itt 
cost of sales for engineering services includes the direct labor costs of engineering staff  as well as depreciation  amortization and allocated facilities costs 
indirect costs are generally allocated to cost of sales based on a percentage of the labor hours incurred for customer design support 
allocated indirect costs represent approximately of the total cost of sales 
we expect that future margin on engineering services will vary based on the experience level of the engineers providing services  the operating costs of the research and development organization as a whole  and the number of service agreements over which the indirect costs are allocated 
our product margin in reflects a write down of inventory to net realizable value of approximately million 
this write down was a result of our exit from retail activities in the second quarter of  resulting in a mark down of remaining product inventory to estimated wholesale values 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to  and decreased by approximately million  or from to the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  design consulting fees  equipment rental  and prototype chip production costs  offset somewhat by decreases in depreciation expense 
personnel and related costs increased approximately  due to the addition of personnel  compensation increases for existing engineering staff and increases in performance bonuses earned in over outside engineering design consulting increased approximately  from to due to increased use of outside design services to supplement in house engineering resources  offset by the expiration of a stock based consulting agreement which reduced stock based compensation expense 
equipment rental expense increased approximately  from to due to increased rental of test and development equipment under operating leases allowing a reduction in capital expenditures for required equipment 
prototype chip production costs increased approximately  from to we maintain a fairly regular cycle of prototype chip runs  however  the fabrication costs vary based on the materials specified and the number of variants requested on each run 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately  from to as certain engineering assets became fully depreciated 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was a result of cost reductions following the retail exit including a reduction in retail product development personnel and related costs of approximately million and a reduction in depreciation and amortization of retail related assets of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by increases in expenses for the use of outside design firms of approximately million  increases in employee stock compensation expense due the adoption of fasr of approximately million  and increases in prototype costs of approximately  stemming from increases in the number of prototype chip production runs 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
although the percentage of revenues invested in our research and development programs may vary from period to period  we are committed to continue investing in our technology development 
we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately million or  from to and decreased by approximately million  or  from to the increase in marketing and selling expenses from to was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  outside consulting and other professional fees and employee stock based compensation expense 
personnel costs increased approximately  due to increases in personnel late in  compensation increases for existing employees and increases in performance bonuses earned from to outside consulting and other professional fees increased approximately  from to due to the use of consultants for expansion of network carrier and other potential customer relationships and legal fees incurred in relation to initial licensing agreements 
employee related stock based compensation expense increased approximately  due to additional stock based awards for sales and marketing employees 
the decrease in marketing and selling expenses from to was primarily due to cost reductions in personnel and related costs of approximately  and reduced retail promotional costs of approximately  following the exit from retail business activities 
these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in employee stock compensation expense of approximately  following the adoption of fasr 
we are committed to continuing our investment in marketing and selling efforts in order to continue to increase market awareness and penetration of our products and technologies  although we do not anticipate any significant increases in overall sales and marketing expenses in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  finance and administrative personnel costs and costs incurred for insurance  shareholder relations and outside professional services 
our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to and decreased by approximately million or from to the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is due to increases in personnel costs and employee stock based compensation  offset partially by decreases in insurance costs 
personnel costs increased approximately  from to primarily due to an increase of approximately  in performance bonuses earned in over these bonuses were largely paid through the issuance of stock awards to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in early employee stock based compensation expense increased approximately  from to due largely to the fair value expense related to long term incentive awards for our executive officers in and the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions 
in addition  consulting and other professional fees  including stock based consulting fees  decreased approximately  from to this decrease is primarily the result of increases in accounting and consulting fees related to our financial accounting system conversion in offset by a decrease in stock based consulting fees primarily from a consulting agreement that expired in the reduction in general and administrative costs from to is due to a reduction in personnel costs of approximately  stemming from staff reductions as well as the movement of certain senior management personnel to different areas of supervision 
we had a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately  following the exit from retail  a reduction in share based consulting fees of approximately  and a reduction in professional fees of approximately  from both legal and accounting fees 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in employee and director stock compensation expense of approximately  following the adoption of fasr 
impairment loss and loss gain on disposal of equipment for the years ended december  and  we recognized an insignificant loss and gain  respectively  on the loss and or disposal of assets 
for  we recognized impairment charges on certain long lived assets related to the exit of our retail activities 
these charges include impairment of prepaid license fees of approximately  impairment of other intangible assets of approximately  and impairment of fixed assets  primarily the manufacturing and prototype facility assets  of approximately  interest income and other interest income and other consist of interest earned on our investments  net gains recognized on the sale of investments  and other miscellaneous income and expense 
interest income and other decreased approximately million from to and increased approximately million from to the decrease in interest income and other from to is primarily due to a reduction in miscellaneous income of approximately  the increase in interest and other income from to is primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances in loss and loss per common share our net loss increased by approximately million or per common share from to  and decreased by approximately million or per common share from to the increase in net loss from to is primarily due to a million or increase in operating expenses 
the decrease in net loss from to is primarily due to a million decrease in operating expenses from to as a result of our exit from retail business activities in  as well as the million inventory impairment charge incurred in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately million including approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
this increase is a result of approximately million in proceeds from a february sale of equity securities and approximately million received from the exercise of approximately  options and warrants in  offset by the use of approximately million in cash for operating activities and approximately million for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs in for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million as a result of million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities  million received from the exercise of options and warrants  and million in proceeds from the maturity of investments  offset by million of cash used for operations and an additional million used for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs 
for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million as a result of million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities  million received from the exercise of options and warrants  and million in proceeds from the maturity of investments  offset by million of cash used for operations and an additional million used for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs 
at december   we were not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
our future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing  customer support and product development for our technologies and products 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and our ability to expand our market opportunities through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers such that we are able to secure a reasonable share of the market 
we do not expect that revenue for will be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for the expected continued losses and use of cash will continue to be funded from available working capital 
on march   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement transaction for net proceeds of approximately million 
we plan to use these proceeds  together with the million in cash and cash equivalents at december   to fund our future business plans 
we believe that our current capital resources together with the proceeds of the march equity financing will be sufficient to support our liquidity requirements at least through the first quarter of the long term continuation of our business plans is dependent upon generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies to offset expenses 
in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or reduce certain discretionary spending 
management believes certain operating costs could be reduced if working capital decreases significantly and additional funding is not available 
in addition  we currently have no outstanding long term debt obligations 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital and or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives 
off balance sheet transactions  arrangements and other relationships  contractual obligations as of december   we have outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the sale of equity securities in various private placement transactions in   and these warrants have exercise prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of and a weighted average remaining contractual life of years 
the estimated fair value of these warrants at their date of issuance of  is included in shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds of approximately million
