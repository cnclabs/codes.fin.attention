snmc is a mortgage lender incorporated under the laws of the state of utah 
snmc is approved and regulated by the federal housing administration fha  a department of the us department of housing and urban development hud  to originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower

the mortgage industry is currently experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
the company funded  of the company s production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and has currently eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings 
the company believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  the company is not offering these loans 
alt a loans represented approximately of the company s production for the six months ended june   only of the production for the third quarter  and for the fourth quarter 
as a consequence of these changes in the industry for alt a loans  snmc suffered a pre tax loss for the twelve months ended december  of approximately  the greatest impact of the operating loss was experienced in july when there were very little secondary gains 
the secondary market improved in subsequent months decreasing the size of the monthly operating loss and the last three months of the mortgage operations showed a significant profit 
in response to the change in market conditions  management increased loan fees  lowered commissions  closed unprofitable branches  obtained more favorable borrowing terms from warehouse lenders  and reduced corporate expenses

as of december   the company was holding a total of  in alt a loans that had not been settled by investors 
this is down from  as of june  the market for the remaining alt a loans is uncertain and if the company was unable to sell its alt a loans it will be required to assume the risk of holding and servicing such loans 
if warehousing lines are not available  the company believes it has adequate liquidity through its life insurance operations to carry such loans until purchased by investors 
even though market conditions have improved somewhat  the company expects further significant industry challenges to continue through the remainder of under these circumstances it is difficult to predict profitability  if any 
profitability may be impacted by volume reduction  changes in margins  increased borrowing costs  and future loan losses 
management has taken and will continue to take a number of actions in response to the changing market conditions 
these include offering alt a loans on a limited basis  closing unprofitable branch offices  obtaining new warehousing agreements at lower interest rates  and expense reduction initiatives

the balance of the reserve for loan losses at december  was  the provision for loan losses is included in other general and administrative expenses

the company believes the loan loss reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably foreseeable future loan losses and that its formula for determining the provision for such reserves is adequate

significant accounting policies the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
please also refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting  asset liability duration matching  sound actuarial practices  adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets  including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas no 

under sfas  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of sfas described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed 
prearranged funeral and pre need cemetery customer obtaining costs costs incurred related to obtaining new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas no 

obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists  the services are performed  collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with sfas no 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as due from sale of loans  and are shown on the basis of the amount of fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
value of business acquired value of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of receivables due on mortgage loans sold to investors  cemetery and mortuary operations  mortgage loan operations and other receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of the cemetery and mortuary receivables is the overall economy 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have significant policy initiation fees front end load  which are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
the company  through its mortuary and cemetery operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage loan loss reserve the company accrues an estimate of future losses on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first year of duration and to repurchase loans in default within the first year 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and best estimate of future liabilities 
deferred compensation the company has deferred compensation agreements with several of its current and past executive officers 
the deferred compensation is payable upon retirement or death of these individuals either in annual installments ten years or lump sum settlement  if approved by the board of directors 
the company has accrued the present value of these benefits based upon their future retirement dates and other factors  on its consolidated financial statements 
depreciation depreciation is calculated principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain casualty insurance  workers compensation and health benefit programs 
self insurance reserves are maintained relative to these programs 
the level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverages 
when estimating the self insurance liabilities and related reserves  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided independent third party actuaries 
management reviews its assumptions with its independent third party administrators and actuaries to evaluate whether the self insurance reserves are adequate 
if actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates  additional reserves may be required 
the estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date

cost of goods and services sold of the mortuaries and cemeteries increased by  from  in to  in this increase was primarily due to increased cemetery and mortuary sales 
risks the following is a description of the most significant risks facing the company and how it mitigates those risks legal regulatory risk the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the company operates will create additional expenses and or risks not anticipated by the company in developing and pricing its products 
that is  regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits  new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the company s mortgage sales 
also  the company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery mortuary business 
the company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations  thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction  and also by employing underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks 
credit risk the risk that issuers of securities owned by the company  mortgagors of mortgage loans on real estate and obligors on construction loans  will default or that other parties  including reinsurers and holders of cemetery mortuary contracts which owe the company money  will not pay 
the company minimizes these risks by adhering to a conservative investment strategy  by maintaining sound reinsurance and credit and collection policies and by providing for any amounts deemed uncollectible 
due to changes in the mortgage industry from higher than expected delinquencies in subprime loans  the company may be unable to sell its alternative documentation loans to investors  which would require the company to assume the risk of holding and servicing such loans 
the mortgage industry is currently experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
the company funded million of the company s production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and has currently eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings 
the company believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  the company is not offering these loans 
alt a loans represented approximately of the company s production for the six months ended june   but only of the production for the third quarter and for the fourth quarter 
even though the market changed for alt a loans  snmc was able to maintain volume in the third and fourth quarters by increasing its production of other mortgage products  primarily government and conforming loans 
as of december   the company had originated a total of  in alt a loans that had not been settled by investors 
this is down from  of alt a loans at june  the market for the remaining alt a loans is uncertain and  if the company were unable to sell its alt a loans  it would be required to assume the risk of holding and servicing such loans 
if warehousing lines are not available the company believes it has adequate liquidity through its life insurance operations to carry such loans until purchased by investors 
interest rate risk the risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the company s investments or impair the ability of the company to market its mortgage and cemetery mortuary products 
this change in rates may cause certain interest sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation 
the company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non conformance with certain policy provisions  by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser  and or by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities 
to the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature  the company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale 
mortality morbidity risk the risk that the company s actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality morbidity experience may cause the company s products to be underpriced  may cause the company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated and other potentially adverse consequences to the business 
the company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices  asset liability duration matching  and sound actuarial practices 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and claims  those used in determining valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  construction loans and other receivables  and those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre need sales 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
on june   security national life insurance company entered into a revolving line of credit with a financial institution to borrow up to  the revolving line of credit is secured by commercial mortgages and construction loans 
the terms of the revolving line of credit is for a one year term and interest is based upon the one year libor rate as of december  
accrued interest will be paid on a monthly basis  with the principal  together with any outstanding accrued interest  to be paid in full on june  security national life insurance company intends to use this financing to provide short term liquidity for its commercial mortgage  construction and warehouse lending operations of its affiliate securitynational mortgage company 
the amount outstanding as of december  was  recently  securitynational mortgage company renewed its warehouse lines of credit with its non affiliated warehouse lenders 
the total amount available under these lines of credit is  the terms of the lines of credit are for one year  with interest rates ranging from to over the three month libor rate to as of december  
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing  however  to date  that has not been necessary 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return  which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december   compared to  as of december  this represents and of the total investments as of december   and december   respectively 
generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds 
at december  or  and at december   or  of the company s total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six  which are considered non investment grade 
the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december   and december   the life insurance subsidiary exceeded the regulatory criteria 
the company s total capitalization of stockholders equity  and bank debt and notes payable was  as of december   as compared to  as of december  stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was and as of december  and december   respectively 
if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately  could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique bps bps bps bps change in market value in thousands lapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period
