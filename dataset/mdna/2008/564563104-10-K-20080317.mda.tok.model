for more information on our discontinued operations  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  the departments of defense  state  homeland security  and justice  and other us federal government agencies 
our expertise includes engineering  systems integration  software services  enterprise architecture  information assurance and security architecture  intelligence operations and analysis support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information operations and computer forensics  information technology  communications integration and engineering support 
with approximately  highly qualified employees  we operate in the united states and over countries worldwide 
we derive revenue primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence and homeland security 
related to the evolving terrorist threats and world events  the us government has substantially increased its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
in  our revenue increased mainly as a result of the expansion of our sustainment and countermine support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  efforts involving telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance  repair  from our work with intelligence agencies in u 
s  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past two years 
for the three years ended december   over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including nasa and pto as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows our revenue from each type of customer as a percentage of our total revenue for the period shown 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies  international agencies  and commercial entities total revenue we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows our revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods shown 
years ended december  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total revenue time and materials contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services to the government as a subcontractor 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue we expect this trend to reverse and the prime contract revenue percentage to increase in future periods due to new contract awards expected in revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees  our subcontractors and through solutions that includes third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
the level of hardware and software purchases we made in support of solutions we provide to our clients increased significantly during these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants  and third party materials  such as hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are facilities  corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance  and executive and senior management 
in addition  we include stock based compensation  as computed under sfas no 
r  as well as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets includes customer relationships and contract backlogs acquired in business combinations are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense and interest income interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings and notes payable  deferred financing charges and interest on capital leases 
interest income is primarily from cash on hand and notes receivable 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rates are approximately  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent in thousands revenue cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income gain on disposal of operations interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes gain on sale of discontinued operation  net of taxes sold to ceo net income revenues revenues increased to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the same period in the acquisition of srs in may added million to our revenues for the year ended december  additionally  the increase is attributable to countermine counter improvised explosive devices ied support in iraq and afghanistan 
one contract for the installation and repair of systems designed for countermine programs and counter ied s accounted for million and million of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were increases on other programs related to the global war on terrorism 
we also experienced growth on us based support contracts 
grs  acquired during the fourth quarter of  contributed million to our revenues for the year ended december  the mbi acquisition on december  had an insignificant impact to our revenue 
we are expecting the growth to continue in as a result of our two recent acquisitions  srs and mbi  and our continued support of the global war on terror  including wars in iraq and afghanistan 
possible future changes in us policy and tactics related to the wars may impact our future performance trend  however  we are not able to predict the impact of such changes at this time 
cost of services cost of services increased to  million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is related to the increase in revenues for the period 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased  to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in this increase was due to larger purchases of equipment and materials directly for contracts and increased use of subcontractors in support of our contracts 
the increase in other direct costs resulted in lower income from continuing operations primarily due to generally lower profit margins on purchases of equipment and materials 
direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased by due to the acquisition of srs and the growth of our work force 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in due to the significant growth in other direct cost 
other direct costs increased by over the same period in  from million to million 
the increase in other direct costs is due to the increase in purchases of equipment and materials  and increased use of subcontractors as noted above 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in expense during the year resulted primarily from the acquisition and integration of srs  increased bid and proposal spending  a net realizable value adjustment related to an intangible asset of a previous acquisition  and share based compensation 
in addition  amortization of intangibles increased due to our acquisition of srs in may as well as our acquisition of grs solutions in october as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction as a percentage of revenues was due largely to a management cost cutting initiative in and leveraging our administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r  respectively 
gain on disposal of operations there were no gains on disposal of operations in in october   we sold assets related to our netwitness business to the netwitness acquisition corporation  an unrelated third party 
we recorded a million pre tax gain in on the transaction 
for additional information see gain on disposal of operations and equity method investment  below 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in for the year ended december   we had an average debt balance of million compared to million for the same period in the increase in our average debt balance in was primarily driven by increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of srs and mbi 
in  we had paid off all borrowings under a previous credit facility which had been used to finance the acquisition of gray hawk systems in as we intend to use our new credit facility to finance our acquisition strategy  our interest expense could increase in the future 
starting in september  the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate three times 
in january  the federal funds rate was reduced an additional three fourths of a percentage point to 
the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend each other money 
changes to the federal funds rate can impact the rate at which we borrow money under our credit facility for additional information see new credit agreement  below 
additional changes to the federal funds rate could cause our interest expense to fluctuate in the future 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the fluctuation is due to increased cash on hand for almost half of the year ended december   collection of interest on an old receivable  and an income tax refund 
as we used a combination of cash on hand and our new credit facility to finance the acquisition of srs in may and mcdonald bradley in december  our cash balance was reduced significantly during the second half of loss from discontinued operations on february   we sold our msm subsidiary 
prior to that date  msm was classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets and discontinued operations  net of applicable income taxes in the consolidated statements of income 
loss from discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the sale of msm resulted in the reflection of only two months of msm operations in versus a full year of msm operations for the same period in for additional information see discontinued operations  below 
gain on sale of discontinued operation on february   we sold msm to msm security services holdings  llc an entity that is solely owned by george j

one contract in support of the installation and repair of systems designed to counter mines and improvised explosive devices ied s accounted for million of revenues in also contributing to the increase was a full year of revenue from our acquisition of gray hawk systems  inc gray hawk on may  gray hawk accounted for million of our increase in revenue year over year 
cost of services cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased  to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in this increase was due to larger purchases of equipment and materials directly for contracts and increased use of subcontractors in support of our contracts

direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased by primarily due to the addition of gray hawk and the growth of our business 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in other direct costs increased by over the same period in  from million to million  which reflects the increase in purchases of equipment and materials  and increased use of subcontractors as noted above

the increase in expense during the year resulted primarily from stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  increased business development expenses  and increased expenses for our internal information technology systems due to our growth and improvements 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bid and proposal spending due to several large recompetitions on our contracts in under sfas no 
r  share based payments not fully vested as of january  and those granted during the year ended december  are measured at estimated fair value and included as compensation expense over the periods services are provided 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas no

loss from discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the loss in contained a loss accrual on intangible assets  including goodwill  of million  net of tax 
the reduced loss in reflected increased revenues during with a lesser increase in associated direct costs

backlog represents estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
at december   srs and mbi contributed approximately million in backlog combined 
we estimate that approximately to of our total backlog will be recognized as revenues prior to december  effects of inflation inflation and uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  such as increases in fuel and other energy costs  and conditions in the mortgage backed securities market could also impact our labor rates beyond the predetermined escalation factors 
however  we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by inflation 
purchases of equipments and materials directly for contracts are usually cost reimbursable 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are the financing of working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
on april   we executed a new credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america na  as administrative agent 
the new credit agreement initially provides for up to million in available borrowings 
see new credit agreement below for additional information 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility and we were contingently liable under letters of credit totaling million  which reduces our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
the maximum available borrowing under our credit facility at december  was million 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our credit facility to meet cash demands 
in the future  we may borrow greater amounts in order to finance acquisitions or new contract start ups 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations net cash flow from discontinued operations net cash flow from operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner  and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
we bill most of our clients and prime contractors monthly after services are rendered 
the reduced cash inflow from operations in as compared to was the result of a significant collection of receivables in under a management collection initiative 
the improved cash inflow from continuing operations in when compared to was primarily from the increased income from continuing operations from the continued growth of our business 
in addition  net cash flows from operating activities was impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
r in  which required the reclassification of excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options from operating cash flows to financing cash flows 
the reduced cash outflow from discontinued operations in compared to  is due to the sale of msm on february  the positive cash flow in discontinued operations for was due to the collection of all outstanding receivables on our defense security services contract within our msm subsidiary 
cash flows from investing activities year ended december  in thousands net investing cash flow from continuing operations net investing cash flow from discontinued operations net cash flow from investing activities our cash flow used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and business acquisitions offset by disposals of operations

purchases of property  equipment and software totaled million which included million purchase of office buildings and land 
cash flow from investing activities could fluctuate significantly in the future with the execution of our acquisition strategy 
cash flows from financing activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from financing activities cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the use of our credit facility to support the acquisitions of srs and mbi  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in addition  we acquired treasury stock with a cost of million related to the distribution of a supplemental executive retirement plan gjp serp for our chairman and chief executive officer for additional information see note stockholders equity and stock options in our consolidated financial statements 
the cash outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock was offset by the excess tax benefits generated by stock option exercises and the gjp serp transaction 
the net cash used in resulted primarily from paying down our line of credit with cash provided from operations  million  offset by cash inflows from the exercise of stock options of million and the impact of sfas no 
r 
sfas r requires that excess tax benefits be shown as a cash inflow from financing activities 
cash provided from financing in was the result of stock option exercises of million and a net increase in borrowings on our credit facility to finance our acquisition of gray hawk in may cash from financing activities is driven primarily from the proceeds on the exercise of stock options and their associated excess tax benefits as well as our use of our credit facility to fund operations and or acquisitions 
in the second quarter of  we refinanced our credit facility to support the acquisition of srs and future liquidity requirements 
new credit agreement on april   we terminated our million credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by citizens bank of pennsylvania  as administrative agent  and executed the new credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america  n 
a  as administrative agent 
the new credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  with a million letter of credit sublimit and a million swing line loan sublimit 
the new credit agreement also contains an accordion feature that permits the company to arrange with the lenders for them to provide up to million in additional commitments 
borrowings under the new credit agreement are collateralized by our assets and bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company a libor based rate plus market rate spreads that are determined based on a company leverage ratio calculation to  or the lender s base rate  which is the lower of the federal funds rate plus or bank of america s prime lending rate 
the maturity date for the new credit agreement is april  the terms of the credit agreement permit prepayment and termination of the loan commitments at any time  subject to certain conditions 
the new credit agreement requires the company to comply with specified financial covenants  including the maintenance of a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the new credit agreement also contains various covenants  including affirmative covenants with respect to certain reporting requirements and maintaining certain business activities  and negative covenants that  among other things  may limit our ability to incur liens  incur additional indebtedness  make investments  make acquisitions  and undertake certain additional actions 
we believe the capital resources available to us under our credit agreements and cash from our operations are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and to support the internal growth we expect to achieve for at least the next months 
we anticipate financing our external growth from acquisitions and our longer term internal growth through one or more of the following sources cash from operations  additional borrowing  issuance of equity  use of the existing revolving facility  or a refinancing of our credit facilities 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements effective june   our lenders issued two letters of credit to fianzas guardiana inbursa  sa fgi on behalf of gse systems  inc gse 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  prior to the sale of these investments on october   we held common and preferred stock in gse and accounted for this investment using the equity method 
the first letter of credit  which was cancelled in march  was in support of an advance payment bond of approximately million  issued by fgi to a customer of gse s power business and had a term of months 
the second letter of credit  which was cancelled in august  was in support of a performance bond of approximately million issued by fgi to the same customer 
in exchange for issuing the letters of credit  we received  warrants to purchase gse s common stock at the market price of gse s common stock as of the close of business on july   as well as a annual fee  paid on a quarterly basis  calculated on the total amount of the then existing value of the letters of credit 
in  an unrealized gain on the increase in fair value of the warrants of million was recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we exercised all  warrants held in gse at a price per share 
additionally  we sold the converted shares at per share 
the transactions resulted in an insignificant loss in the period due to the change in fair value of the warrants and subsequent sale of the converted securities

critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees and the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation  and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price  or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered  or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts which are specifically described in the scope section of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or other appropriate accounting literature we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
accounting for business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets  financial assets and separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 and no longer amortize goodwill  rather  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year and no adjustments were necessary for our continuing operations 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
as noted above in our discussion of discontinued operations we recorded a loss accrual for the impairment of goodwill related to msm at december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas  which represents the completion of the first phase in the fasb s postretirement benefits accounting project  applies to all plan sponsors who offer defined postretirement benefit plans and requires an entity to recognize in its balance sheet an asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status 
measure a defined benefit postretirement plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year 
recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  for public entities 
accordingly  we made adjustments to initially adopt sfas in the fourth quarter of the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end balance sheet is effective for fiscal years ending after december  our defined benefit pension plans have a fiscal year end of december st and therefore the measurement date provisions of the standard were not applicable 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in accounting practices used in regards to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for benefits related to income taxes 
the provisions of fin are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  effective january   we adopted fin to all tax positions and recorded a thousand cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
see item footnote for further discussion on the adoption of fin in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  but does not require any new fair value measurements 
a fair value hierarchy was established to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value 
disclosure requirements require disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall 
on october   the fasb deferred the effective date for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  for fiscal years beginning after november   the company will be required to implement sfas for financial assets and liabilities  as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
at this time we are assessing the impact the adoption of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to measure eligible items at fair value 
for items where the fair value election is made  the company will be required to report unrealized gains or losses in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas r 
the new standard moves closer to a fair value model by requiring the acquirer to measure all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  including the measurement of noncontrolling interests at fair value 
the statement also establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in addition  sfas r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  preacquisition contingencies  in process research and development  restructuring costs  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the effective date of sfas r is for fiscal years beginning after december  for transactions consummated after the effective date of sfas r  prospective application of the new standard is applied 
for business combinations consummated prior to the effective date of sfas r  the guidance in sfas is applied 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
and provides accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  commonly referred to as minority interest  and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the new standard requires noncontrolling interests to be presented separately within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position 
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests will be clearly identified and presented on the face of the statement of operations 
when a change in control of a subsidiary occurs it will either be accounted for as an equity transaction  when control is maintained  or a gain or loss will be recognized when control is not maintained 
the remaining noncontrolling interest will be remeasured to fair value when control is lost 
sfas requires that the noncontrolling interest continue to be attributed its share of losses and thus is no longer limited to the original carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest 
this may result in a negative carrying balance 
the effective date of sfas is for fiscal years beginning after december  the statement will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which the statement is adopted except for presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force ratified issue eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements  which clarifies the treatment of split dollar life insurance arrangements in regards to sfas and apb an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with sfas if  in substance  a postretirement benefit plan exists or opinion if the arrangement is  in substance  an individual deferred compensation contract based on the substantive agreement with the employee 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility
