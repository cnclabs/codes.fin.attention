executive overview we operate through two business segments bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
bluegreen resorts develops  markets and sells vois for inclusion in the bluegreen vacation club  and provides resort management services to resort property owners associations 
bluegreen communities acquires large tracts of real estate  which it subdivides  improves in some cases to include a golf course on the property and other related amenities and sells  typically on a retail basis  as homesites 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and net earnings 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  with the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings historically expected to occur in the quarters ending in september and december each year 
although we expect to see more potential customers at our sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september  ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to complex down payment requirements for purchases under gaap or due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we expect that we will continue to invest in projects that will require substantial development with significant capital requirements  and as a consequence  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly between quarterly and annual periods as a result of the required use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have materially impacted our revenues and results of operations  specifically due to periodic increases in the sales prices of our vois and homesites and continued increases in construction and development costs 
we expect the increased construction and development costs over the past few years to result in an increase in our cost of sales for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our vois and homesites would adversely impact consumer sentiment  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  to the extent inflationary trends or other factors affect interest rates  a portion of our debt service costs may increase 
during our communities business was adversely impacted by the slow real estate market 
although to date we have not experienced a material reduction in selling prices  in certain markets we experienced a decrease in demand and hence a decrease in sales volume 
we recognize revenue on homesite and voi sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the refund or rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development of the real estate sold 
refund or rescission periods include those required by law and those provided for in our sales contracts 
with respect to voi sales  the revenue recognition rules require that incentives and other similarly treated items such as customer down payment equity earned through our sampler program be considered in calculating the required down payment for our voi sales 
if  after considering the value of sales incentives provided  the required of sales price down payment threshold is not met  the voi sale and the related cost of sale and direct selling costs are deferred and not recognized until the buyer s commitment test is satisfied  generally through the receipt of required mortgage note payments from the buyer 
further  in cases where all development has not been completed  recognition of income is subject to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of vacation ownership resorts and residential communities  including carrying costs such as interest and taxes  are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of real estate sold as the respective revenues are recognized 
a significant portion of our revenues historically has been  and is expected to continue to be  comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
by way of example  in  gains on sales of receivables comprised approximately    and of our consolidated net income in the quarters ended march   june   september   and december   respectively 
the gains are recorded on our consolidated statement of income and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
deterioration in the credit markets has made it more difficult to consummate term securitization transactions on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  a portion of the gains on sales of receivables in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of related to sales under our receivables purchase facility with general electric real estate  which was fully utilized in the fourth quarter of absent the consummation of appropriately structured off balance sheet receivable sales transactions  our results of operations in certain quarters could be materially  adversely affected 
effective january   the portion of the gains on sales of notes receivable related to the reversal of previously recorded allowances for loan losses on the receivables sold is recorded as a component of revenue on sales of vois 
the amount of gains recognized and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s best estimates of future prepayment rates  default rates  loss severity rates  discount rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans occur more quickly than we projected at the time such loans were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  interest income would be less than expected and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to operations 
if actual defaults or other factors discussed above with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  charge offs would exceed previously estimated amounts and the cash flow from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would decrease 
also  to the extent the portfolio of receivables sold fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to  for example  an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or certain other events occur  the funds received from obligors must be distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow to us from the retained interests in notes receivable sold will be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
in addition  from time to time  we may agree to defer receiving all or a portion of our deferred payment on certain of our retained interests in notes receivable sold in an accommodation to third party rating agencies 
also  as market conditions change  the discount rates that we use to value our retained interests in notes receivable sold may change 
if these situations occur  it could cause a material decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
there is no assurance that the carrying value of our retained interests in notes receivable sold will be fully realized or that future loan sales will be consummated or  if consummated  result in gains 
see voi receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements  below 
in addition  we have historically sold voi notes receivables to financial institutions through warehouse purchase facilities to monetize the receivables while accumulating receivables for a future term securitization transaction 
we are currently structuring and intend to structure future warehouse purchase facilities so that sales of voi receivables through these facilities will be accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings rather than as off balance sheet sales 
therefore  we will not recognize a gain on the sales of receivables transferred to the warehouse purchase facilities until such receivables are subsequently included in a properly structured term securitization transaction 
if the timing of our term securitizations or securitization type transactions changes from prior history  it will impact quarterly patterns as compared to comparable prior periods 
during  the deteriorating credit market  primarily driven by the sub prime loan crisis  impacted our operations 
although we were able to secure financing and securitize our voi notes receivable  such transactions were more difficult to effect and were priced at a higher cost than recent years 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions  which changes the rules for many aspects of timeshare accounting  including revenue recognition  inventory costing and incidental operations see note of the financial statements for more information on sfas no 
and its impact on our financial statements 
we recognized a million or per diluted share charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax and minority interest in  for the adoption of sfas no 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely impacted 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  as amended by sfas no 
regarding voi sales  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the calculation of the adequacy of the buyer s commitment changed so that cash received towards the purchase of our vois is reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type  or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may result in additional voi sales being deferred  and thus our results of operations could be materially  adversely impacted 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  and thus our results of operations could be materially  adversely impacted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  the capitalized costs of our real estate projects are assigned to individual homesites in the communities projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each homesite 
prior to this method of allocation was also used to determine the inventory value and related costs of sales for our vois 
effective january   as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 voi inventory and cost of sales is accounted for using the relative sales value method 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of voi inventory repossessed  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
allowance for loan losses 
prior to january   we estimated credit losses on our notes receivable portfolios generated in connection with the sale of vois and homesites in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as our notes receivable portfolios consisted of large groups of smaller balance  homogeneous loans 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  we first segmented our notes receivable by identifying risk characteristics that are common to groups of loans and then estimated credit losses based on the risks associated with these segments 
under this method  the amount of loss was reduced by the estimated value of the defaulted inventory to be recovered 
although this policy continues for notes receivable generated in connection with the sale of homesites  effective january   we changed our accounting for loan losses for voi notes receivable in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we estimate uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period 
we use a static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
additionally  under sfas no 
no consideration is given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible voi notes receivable 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the table below sets forth the activity in our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable for the year ended december  in thousands balance  december  provision for loan losses less allowance on sold receivables less write offs of uncollectible receivables balance  december  includes provision for loan losses on homesite notes receivable the average annual default rates and delinquency rates or more days past due on bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities receivables owned or serviced by us were as follows average annual default rates year ended december  division bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities delinquency rates as of december  division bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities excludes december default of a million note receivable not made in the ordinary course of business 
substantially all defaulted voi notes receivable result in the holder of the note receivable acquiring the related voi that secured the note receivable 
in cases where we have retained or required ownership of the voi notes receivable  the voi is acquired and resold in the normal course of business 
transfers of financial assets 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell voi notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to sfas no 
and related interpretations 
the evaluation of sale treatment under sfas no 
involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie  put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates us to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales in accordance with sfas no 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches and rights to excess interest spread  which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate the fair value of our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately million in the fair market value of our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
the overall decrease in the fair value of our retained interest in notes receivable sold in reflects an increase in the discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows on our retained interests as a result of the overall increase in return required by investors in our securitization transactions due to the deteriorating credit market in the second half of asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets including our real estate properties under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors that we consider in making this evaluation include our estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project based on current retail prices and our estimates of costs to complete each project 
should our estimates of these factors change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been assigned 
as of december  and  only our bluegreen resorts reporting unit had any recorded goodwill 
should our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value  and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning with our fiscal year  at which time it will be applied prospectively 
in february  the fasb agreed to partially defer the effective date  for one year  of sfas no 
 for non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for us beginning with our fiscal year 
we do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any financial assets or liabilities at the present time 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no

 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no 
also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning with our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes an allocation of general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not reflect the actual economic costs  contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted

on january   which  among other things  required us to net estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable from sales of real estate and include a significant portion of our gains on sales of notes receivable in sales of real estate 
we were not permitted to retrospectively apply sfas no 
to periods prior to january  general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead have been excluded from the tables 
corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see corporate general and administrative expenses  below  for further discussion 
sales and field operations 
consolidated sales of real estate were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
consolidated sales of real estate increased from to and from to bluegreen resorts 
during   and  sales of vois contributed million  million  and million of our total consolidated sales of real estate  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and the deferral of sales in accordance with sfas no 
year ended december  december  december  number of voi sale transactions average sales price per transaction year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bluegreen resorts net sales of real estate increased million  or  during as compared to as a result of higher sales of vois and higher gains on sales of voi notes receivable  partially offset by an increase in estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
gross voi sales increased million  or  driven primarily by our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased by and accounted for of resorts sales during as compared to during also contributing to higher sales was same resort sales increases at many of our sales offices 
same resort sales increased by almost during as compared to and were highlighted by increases in sales originating at the smoky mountain preview center in sevierville  tennessee  the falls village resort in branson  missouri  mountainloft in gatlinburg  tennessee  and an offsite sales office in las vegas  nevada 
higher sales were also attributable  to a lesser extent  to the opening of new sales offices at seaglass tower  located in myrtle beach  sc  and at a new resort under development in williamsburg  virginia  as well as an system wide price increase that went into effect during march these factors  combined with a overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during  and a relatively consistent  overall sale to tour conversion ratio of during these periods  contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to our sale to tour conversion ratio for new prospects ie  excluding sales to our existing owners was during both and the increase in the average sales price per transaction  primarily due to the system wide price increase  also contributed to higher voi sales 
as required under sfas no 
 approximately million and million of gain on sales of voi notes receivable in and  respectively  are reflected as an increase to voi sales 
the majority of these gains represent the reversal of amounts previously recognized as estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
the increase in gain on sale of voi notes receivable in as compared to represents the sale of million of loans in compared to million in the increase in voi revenue and gains on sales of voi notes receivable were partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable primarily due to higher voi sales in as compared to bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
as compared to the gross margin earned in  our gross margin of for was negatively impacted by a higher proportion of sales of vois in of relatively higher cost resorts as compared to overall gross margins on vois sold in decreased compared to previous periods reflecting the higher costs of acquiring and developing properties 
acquisition and development costs may continue to increase in future periods and  as a result  we may not be able to earn current or historical gross margins 
in addition  upgrade sales to existing owners typically yield a lower gross margin as we offer more favorable pricing for larger cumulative purchases 
other resort operations revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in represented higher fees earned by our resort management company for resort management and other related services 
overall resort management and related fees increased in the aggregate due to an increase in the number of resorts and owners for which we provide management and related services 
fees earned in by our wholly owned title company were consistent with those earned in cost of other resort operations decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease reflects an increase in rental proceeds earned in connection with the rental of unsold vois as well as an increase in sampler stays  both of which are recorded as a reduction to cost of other resort operations 
these reductions were partially offset by higher maintenance fees and subsidies paid on vois in inventory relative to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies increased in the aggregate based on an increase in our unsold voi inventory 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing expenses during as compared to reflects the overall increase in sales prospects  higher marketing expenses at our newly opened off site sales offices and a general increase in overall marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling and marketing costs decreased primarily as a result of the recognition of higher gains on sale recorded as a component of revenue in as compared to  increased sales to existing owners  which generally carry lower marketing costs  as well as changes to our sales commission policy 
we believe that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurance can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  field general and administrative expenses decreased from during to in as of december   approximately million and million of sales and field operating profit  respectively  were deferred under sfas no 
because such sales did not yet meet the minimum required initial investment 
this compares to million and million of sales and field operating profits  respectively  deferred as of december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as previously discussed  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a material change to our accounting practices related to our timeshare operations 
accordingly  the operating results of bluegreen resorts for periods prior to are not comparable to those subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
for this reason  we will use the pro forma presentations below to discuss bluegreen resorts results of operations for the period as compared to  as we believe that the pro forma results provide a better basis for comparison to than our united states generally accepted accounting principles results of operations under sfas no 
year ended december  year ended december  pro forma excluding impact of sfas no 
amount percentage of sales amount percentage of sales amount percentage of sales sales of real estate cost of real estate sales gross profit other resort operations revenue cost of other resort operations selling and marketing expenses field general and administrative expenses field operating profit bluegreen resorts sales increased million or during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 sales would have increased million or during as compared to the pro forma increase was due primarily to same resort sales increases at many of our sales offices 
same resort sales increased by approximately during as compared to and were highlighted by increases in sales at the fountains sales office in orlando  florida  our bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar sales office in ridgedale  missouri  our falls village sales office in branson  missouri  and our mountainloft sales office in gatlinburg  tennessee 
the overall increase in sales was due in part to our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased by and accounted for of bluegreen resort sales during as compared to during this  combined with an overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during  and a relatively consistent  overall sale to tour conversion ratio of during these periods  significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to our sale to tour conversion ratio for new prospects ie  excluding sales to our existing owners was and during and  respectively 
the increase in the number of prospects seen by bluegreen resorts and  consequently the increase in sales was partially due to our eight new sales sites opened in late and in our new sales offices include an offsite sales office in atlanta  georgia opened in november  an offsite sales office in chicago  illinois opened in february  an offsite sales office in las vegas  nevada opened in july  and sales offices located at two of our new resorts daytona seabreeze in daytona beach shores  florida opened in december  and carolina grande in myrtle beach  south carolina opened in march 
we also opened sales offices in williamsburg  virginia opened in august and wisconsin dells  wisconsin opened in july on the grounds where we recently purchased properties for future resort locations 
the increase in the average sales price per transaction  primarily due to a system wide price increase of approximately effective january  also contributed to the increase in sales 
bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
excluding the adoption of sfas no 
 our gross margin would have increased from during to during  primarily as a result of the previously discussed price increase 
other resort operations revenues decreased million or during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 other resort operations revenue would have decreased million or during as compared to the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of decreasing other resort operations revenue due to the reclassification of rental proceeds from other resort operations revenue to net against cost of other resort operations  partially offset by the classification of revenue for sales incentives for voi sales to other resort operations revenue 
the results also represent lower sales of mini vacation packages on behalf of third parties 
during  we transitioned our mini vacation package business from primarily selling the packages to third parties to using the sales tours generated by mini vacations primarily for use at our own sales offices 
this transition was substantially completed in the second half of as a result  this has had the effect of increasing the profitability of our other resort operations reducing costs in excess of revenues but increasing our selling and marketing costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in fees earned by our wholly owned title company as well as higher resort management fees earned by our resort management company 
resort management fees increased in the aggregate due to an increase in the number of resorts for which we provide management services 
cost of other resort operations decreased million  or  during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 cost of other resort operations would have decreased million or during as compared to the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of decreasing cost of other resort operations due primarily to the reclassification of rental proceeds from other resort operations revenue and the reclassification of the net proceeds of the sampler program from selling and marketing expenses to a reduction to cost of other resort operations 
the decrease also reflects a significant reduction in the amount of cost related to mini vacations sold on behalf of third parties  as previously discussed  partially offset by higher subsidies incurred on our voi inventory relative to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies increased in the aggregate based on an increase in our unsold voi inventory 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of increasing selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales as a result of the immediate recognition of marketing expenses associated with certain voi sales that have not yet been recognized  and due to the reclassification of the net profits of the sampler program from selling and marketing expenses to a reduction of cost of other resort operations 
the increase in selling and marketing expense during  as compared to  also reflects a general increase in overall marketing expenses due primarily to start up costs related to new marketing alliances  higher marketing expenses as a percentage of sales at our newly opened off site sales offices and the previously discussed transition of our mini vacations packages from being sold externally to being used internally 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact on selling and marketing cost of the increase in sales to existing owners during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 selling and marketing expense would have increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  on a pro forma basis  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to the increase in field general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the cost of opening and operating our new sales offices 
additionally  the increase in also reflects costs to close an off site sales office located in king of prussia  pennsylvania 
bluegreen communities

the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  sales in certain properties that had not completed the platting process  and excluding sales of bulk parcels 
year ended december  december  december  number of homesites sold average sales price per homesite bluegreen communities sales decreased million  or  during as compared to largely reflecting several of the company s more mature developments either approaching sell out or sold out during or prior to  partially offset by the recognition of sales generated at sanctuary river club which commenced sales in and the recognition of million of sales made in at properties which had not completed the platting process until in addition to the impact of reduced inventory levels  we believe that bluegreen communities sales in certain regions have been and continue to be negatively impacted by a generally slower residential real estate market 
we anticipate that future land purchases will only be consummated on a selective basis with a view towards aligning our bluegreen communities inventory with current and anticipated lower market demand 
before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  during we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during sales in consisted of real estate sold at the following properties properties sold in projects not substantially sold out at december  in s project difference chapel ridge sanctuary cove at st

bluegreen communities sales decreased million or during as compared to as a result of several of the company s more mature developments either approaching sell out or selling out during  as well as the impact of certain revenue recognition policies described below  partially offset by sales generated at new bluegreen communities that commenced sales in before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  during we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during these sales consisted of real estate sold at the following projects properties sold in projects not substantially sold out at december  in s project difference chapel ridge sanctuary cove at st

additionally  because the platting process for certain properties sold near the end of was not completed before the end of we were unable to recognize approximately million of sales in  which were subsequently recognized in bluegreen communities gross margin increased from in to in bluegreen communities gross margin decreased from in to in variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects  which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc 
impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  although the gross margin of bluegreen communities has historically been between and of sales 
in addition  during  our gross margin was negatively impacted by the bulk sale of property near san diego  california  which had a relatively low margin  as well as the recognition of a charge of approximately million to repair a lake amenity at a nearly sold out community 
other communities operations include the operation of our daily fee golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
other communities operations revenues increased million  or  from million to million and the related costs increased million  or  from million to million during and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to the million sale of the real estate and operations of our traditions of braselton golf course at a profit of approximately  partially offset by lower golf course revenues and lower fees earned from our realty resale operations 
during  other communities operations revenues increased million  or  to million from million in and the related costs increased million or to million from million in  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to the opening of daily fee golf courses located at our chapel ridge and sanctuary cove at st 
andrew s sound communities 
certain of our golf course operations periodically incur losses during periods of low level of play  especially during the winter months  and as a result of fixed operating expenses and high maintenance costs 
also  certain of our golf courses are still in their early years of operations during the periods presented 
we believe that the operating results of these new courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located build their homes and begin living in the community  as this should increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be achieved 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities remained relatively constant in and however  as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of sales in reflects higher advertising expenses  primarily as a result of the shift to internet based marketing  costs incurred prior to the periods when prospects generated are expected to tour our communities  as well as a larger number of bulk sale transactions in  which generally carry a lower commission expense than sales made on a retail basis 
higher advertising expenses were partially off set by lower commission commensurate with the sales decrease 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses remained constant at during and the decrease in total selling and marketing costs in reflected lower commissions commensurate with the sales decrease and as a result of bulk sales which typically carry a lower commission percentage 
this decrease was partially offset by higher advertising expenses  which were the result of start up advertising associated with our new developments 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses remained constant at million during and as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in  reflecting the overall decrease in sales 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased from million during to million during this decrease in general and administrative expenses in was due to the closure of five sales offices in the second half of the offices at silver lakes ranch  mountain lakes ranch  quail springs ranch  brickshire  and the traditions of braselton were closed as a result of the substantial sell out at these locations 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in  reflecting the overall decrease in sales 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  resorts acquisition and development  mortgage servicing  treasury and legal 
such expenses were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the million  or  decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of a charge totaling million related to a separation agreement with our former chief executive officer described below  a recognition of a million write off related to the abandonment of a software development project  the recognition of expenses during totaling approximately million associated with the adoption of our shareholders rights plan and related litigation  and higher fees earned by our mortgage servicing 
as previously discussed  we earn fees for servicing the notes receivable that we have sold in term securitization transactions and through our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities 
these factors were partially offset by higher costs associated with information technology spending  primarily as a result of the implementation of new computer systems to support our resort sales organization 
the million  or  increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of stock compensation expense of million as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  including  related to the modification of existing stock options of our former chief executive officer who retired at the end of and charges totaling million related to the total compensation payable under a separation agreement with our former chief executive officer  the recognition of expenses totaling approximately million associated with the adoption of our shareholders rights plan and related litigation  the recognition of a million write off related to the abandonment of a software development project  and  an overall increase in corporate headcount to support our growth at bluegreen resorts 
these increases were partially off set by higher profits from our mortgage servicing operations in as compared to for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  see sales and field operations  above 
interest income 
interest income is earned from our notes receivable  retained interests in notes receivable sold and cash and cash equivalents 
interest income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income during as compared to was due primarily to higher interest accretion on our retained interest in notes receivable sold as a result of higher average retained interests in due to the sale of additional voi notes receivable and higher average vacation ownership notes receivable balances during as compared to this increase was partially off set by the recognition of other than temporary decreases totaling approximately million in in the fair value of certain of our retained interests in voi notes receivable 
the overall decrease in the value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable in an increase in the discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows on our retained interests as a result of the overall increase in return required by investors in our securitization transactions due to the deteriorating credit market in the second half of there can be no assurance that additional charges will not be required due to other than temporary decreases in the fair value of our retained interest in voi notes receivables 
the increase in interest income during as compared to was due primarily to higher interest accretion on our retained interests in notes receivable sold as a result of higher average retained interests in due to the sale of additional notes receivable and higher average voi notes receivable balances during as compared to gain on sales of notes receivable 
we recognized total gains on the sale of notes receivable totaling million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
as required under sfas no 
 approximately million and million of the gain in and  respectively  was reflected as an increase to voi sales 
during   and  we sold million  million  and million of notes receivable 
the decrease in gain recognized in as compared to was a result of a lower advance rate and higher interest costs in the term securitization compared to the transactions 
the gain on sale of notes receivable in was calculated on a different basis  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 and is therefore not comparable to the other periods presented 
the amount of notes receivable sold during a period depends on several factors  including the state of the market generally  the amount of availability  if any  under receivables purchase facilities  the amount of eligible receivables available for sale  our cash requirements  the covenants and other provisions of the relevant voi receivables purchase facility as described further below and management s discretion 
the generally accepted accounting principles governing our sale of receivable transactions are evolving and achieving off balance sheet accounting treatment is becoming more difficult 
due to the complexity of the accounting rules surrounding such transactions  we have decided to limit the use of off balance sheet structures 
in  we structured a voi receivables purchase facility that is used to accumulate receivables pending a term securitization transaction in a manner so as to account for sales of receivables under such facilities as on balance sheet borrowings pursuant to sfas no 
no gains are recognized on the sales of receivables to this facility until the receivables are included in an appropriately structured term securitization transaction 
we expect to continue this accounting treatment for similarly structured facilities for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that the volatility of our quarterly earnings will increase prospectively  but we do not anticipate that this will materially impact annual earnings  as long as the facilities and term securitizations continue to be available to us 
however  as evidenced by the recent disruptions in the credit markets associated with the deterioration in the subprime lending markets and other liquidity issues  there is no assurance that we will continue to have access to the facilities or securitizations on favorable terms or at all 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during was primarily a result of higher average debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized in connection with current development activity as compared to average debt outstanding during increased in part as a result of the february issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures and increased borrowings on operating lines of credit during the second half of in order to increase our cash on hand 
the increase in interest expense for as compared was primarily a result of higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates in partially offset by increased capitalized interest on current development activity 
average debt outstanding in increased in part as a result of our on balance sheet treatment of transfers to the bb t purchase facility as discussed further under credit facilities for bluegreen resorts receivables and inventories and due to increased borrowings in connection with inventory acquisition and development activities 
total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
our effective cost of borrowing was   and for   and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded provisions for loan losses totaling million  million and million during   and  respectively 
effective january   sfas no 
requires that the estimated losses on originated voi mortgages exclude the benefit of an estimate for the value of future recoveries and further requires that the provision for loan losses for voi receivables be reflected as a reduction of voi sales see voi sales above 
accordingly  the provisions for loan losses recorded during are not comparable to that recorded during and we determine the adequacy of our reserve for loan losses and review it on a regular basis considering  among other factors  historical frequency of default  loss experience  static pool analyses  estimated value of the underlying collateral communities notes receivable  only  present and expected economic conditions  as well as other factors 
effective january   we changed our accounting for loan losses on our voi notes receivable in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we estimate uncollectibles based on historic uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable 
the following table summarizes our allowance for loan losses by division as of december  and bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities other total december  notes receivable allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable december  notes receivable allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary 
we include the results of operations and financial position of bluegreen big cedar vacations  llc the subsidiary  our owned subsidiary  in our consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary is the portion of our consolidated pre tax income that is attributable to big cedar  llc  the unaffiliated interest holder in the subsidiary 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
pre tax income for the subsidiary has increased over the periods presented as sales at the bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar have increased 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
our annual effective income tax rate varies as our mix of taxable earnings shifts among the various states in which we operate 
additionally  in march  we received notice from the irs that our and federal income tax returns had been selected for examination 
on october   we received an examination report from the irs for the and tax periods asserting  in the aggregate  approximately  of additional tax due  plus accrued interest 
also  as discussed in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements  in july the state of michigan enacted a tax change effective january  based on our current operations  we do not expect that this change will materially impact our effective tax rate 
as we expand our operations into areas where we currently do not conduct a significant amount of business or if our mix of income or currently enacted tax rates change  there can be no assurance that our effective income tax rate will be comparable to our historical rates 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle from the adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a net charge of million  which is presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle primarily consists of the deferral of voi sales and related costs for sales that were previously recognized but did not meet the required down payment threshold at january   due to sales incentives provided to buyers and the treatment of our sampler program  and the related tax benefit  net of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge  related to the minority interest in the subsidiary 
summary 
based on the factors discussed above  our net income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for   and in thousands year ended december  december  december  cash flows provided used by operating activities cash flows used provided by investing activities cash flows used provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million from net cash inflows of million to an outflow of million during and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities during compared to was primarily driven by higher resort development spending at our williamsburg  las vegas  and odyssey dells projects and an increase in notes receivable due to increased voi sales 
this decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of notes receivable during  as compared to cash flows from operating activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to million during and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities during compared to was primarily driven by higher inventory acquisition and development spending and an increase in notes receivable due to increased voi sales 
during we acquired land for four bluegreen communities the bridges at preston crossings  king oaks  vintage oaks at the vineyard as well as four parcels of land for bluegreen resorts located in newland  north carolina  williamsburg  virginia  las vegas  nevada  and wisconsin dells  wisconsin 
partially offsetting the decrease in cash flows from operations were higher proceeds from the sale of notes receivable during  as compared to cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities increased million from net cash inflows of million to million for and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold and lower expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows from investing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to net inflows of million for and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold 
this increase was partially offset by higher expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities increased million from net cash outflows of million to inflows of million during and  respectively 
we borrowed million in under our lines of credit compared to million in  and incurred higher net borrowings under our collateralized notes receivable facilities in as compared to these cash flows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in  as compared to the receipt of only million of such proceeds during cash flows from financing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during and  respectively 
in  we redeemed million of our senior secured notes 
additionally  we borrowed million in under our lines of credit compared to million in  and incurred higher net repayments under our collateralized notes receivable facilities in as compared to these cash flows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in  as compared to the receipt of only million of such proceeds during liquidity and capital resources our capital resources are provided from both internal and external sources 
our primary capital resources from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv principal and interest payments received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois and homesites and v net cash generated from other resort services and other communities operations 
historically  external sources of liquidity have included non recourse sales of notes receivable  borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  seller and bank financing of inventory acquisitions and the issuance of debt securities 
our capital resources are used to support our operations  including i acquiring and developing inventory  ii providing financing for customer purchases  iii funding operating expenses and iv satisfying our debt and other obligations 
as we are continually selling and marketing real estate vois and homesites  it is necessary for us to acquire and develop new resorts and communities in order to maintain adequate levels of inventory to support operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to require external sources of liquidity to support our operations  satisfy our debt and other obligations and to provide funds for growth 
our levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i we have significant cash requirements to service debt  reducing funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as conditions in the credit markets  generally  ii our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in the indentures  the credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on or repurchase preferred or common stock  and iv our leverage position may limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
subject to the continued availability of financing and liquidity  we currently intend to continue to pursue a growth oriented strategy  particularly with respect to our bluegreen resorts business segment 
in connection with this strategy  we may from time to time acquire  among other things  additional resort properties and completed but unsold vois  land upon which additional resorts may be built  management contracts  loan portfolios of vacation ownership mortgages  portfolios which include properties or assets which may be integrated into our operations  interests in joint ventures  and operating companies providing or possessing management  sales  marketing  development  administration and or other expertise with respect to our operations in the vacation ownership industry 
in addition  we have focused bluegreen communities activities on larger  more capital intensive projects particularly in those regions where we believe the market for our products is strongest 
in february  we announced that we intend to pursue a rights offering to our shareholders of up to million of our common stock 
we intend to file a registration statement relating to the rights offering in march 
while bluegreen had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december   the purpose of the rights offering is to further strengthen our balance sheet in light of our million of senior secured notes maturing in april and to support growth  including growth through acquisitions 
we intend to pursue available opportunities and evaluate our business plan for bluegreen communities  with the long term goal being to best position our company to take advantage of strategic alternatives so as to maximize shareholder value in the future 
the following is a discussion of our purchase and credit facilities that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding senior secured notes payable  junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to an ongoing credit facility and capital leases 
vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of of the purchase in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing and administrative expenses are primarily cash expenses and  in our case for the year ended december   approximated of sales 
accordingly  having facilities available for the hypothecation or sale of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor to our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
we have historically chosen to monetize our receivables through various facilities and through periodic term securitization transactions  as these off balance sheet arrangements provide us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have typically generated gains on our income statement on a periodic basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
there is no assurance that these arrangements will be available in the future 
historically  we have been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
in each transaction  the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity has a retained interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable transaction documents  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interest in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  make interest and principal payments to investors  fund required reserves  if any  and pay distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents  however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds go to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the use of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent there was any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization type facility certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee 
term securitization 
in september  bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  inc  served as initial purchaser and placement agent for a private offering and sale of million of vacation ownership receivable backed securities the term securitization 
approximately million in aggregate principal of vacation ownership receivables were securitized and sold in this transaction  including million in aggregate principal of vacation ownership receivables that were previously transferred under the bb t purchase facility  million of vacation ownership receivables owned by the company immediately prior to the term securitization  and  an additional million in aggregate principal of the company s qualifying vacation ownership receivables that were sold by us in the fourth quarter of during  we sold million in pre funded receivables and the million purchase price was disbursed to us from the escrow account

all principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to principal and interest due under the facility 
indebtedness under the facility bears interest adjusted monthly at the one month libor rate plus 
we act as servicer under this facility for a fee 
during the bluegreen big cedar joint venture pledged million in aggregate principal balance of notes receivable under the facility and received million in cash proceeds  net of issuance costs 
new resorts facilities in process 
the bb t purchase facility and the ge bluegreen big cedar facility discussed above are the only ongoing receivables facilities under which we currently have the ability to monetize our voi notes receivable as of december  we currently have a term sheet with bb t for a two year million revolving receivables purchase facility the bb t purchase facility and a term sheet with wellington financial for a two year million revolving receivables hypothecation facility the wellington facility 
for future resort acquisition and development activities we have executed a term sheet for a two year million facility with textron financial 
there can be no assurances that these facilities will be consummated on the agreed upon terms  or at all 
factors which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new or additional voi receivable purchase or hypothecation facilities include a downturn in general economic conditions  negative trends in the commercial paper or libor markets  increases in interest rates  a decrease in the number of financial institutions or other entities willing to enter into facilities with voi companies  a deterioration in the performance of our voi notes receivable or in the performance of portfolios sold in prior transactions  specifically increased delinquency  default and loss severity rates  and a deterioration in our performance generally 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain new purchase facilities or will be in a position to replace our existing purchase facilities when they are fully funded or expire 
as indicated above  our inability to sell voi receivables under a current or future facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
however  management believes that to the extent we could not sell receivables under a purchase facility  we could potentially mitigate the adverse impact on our liquidity by using our receivables as collateral under existing or future credit facilities 
the foothill facility 
we are in the process of renewing and expanding to million a revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc foothill primarily used for borrowings collateralized by bluegreen communities receivables and inventory  but under which we will also be able to borrow a portion of the facility collateralized by the pledge of voi receivables 
for further details on this facility  see credit facilities for bluegreen communities receivables and inventories below 
credit facilities for bluegreen communities receivables and inventories the foothill facility 
we are in documentation for the renewal and expansion of a revolving credit facility with foothill secured by the pledge of bluegreen communities receivables  bluegreen communities inventory borrowings and  as indicated above  up to million of the total facility available for the pledge of bluegreen resorts receivables the foothill facility 
there can be no assurances that we will renew the foothill facility on favorable terms  if at all 
the gmac communities facility 
we have a revolving credit facility with rfc the gmac communities facility for the purpose of financing our bluegreen communities real estate acquisitions and development activities 
the gmac communities facility is secured by the real property homesites and personal property related thereto at the following bluegreen communities projects  as well as any bluegreen communities projects acquired by us with funds borrowed under the gmac communities facility the secured projects catawba falls preserve black mountain  north carolina  lake ridge at joe pool lake cedar hill and grand prairie  texas  mystic shores at canyon lake spring branch  texas  havenwood at hunter s crossing new braunfels  texas  the bridges at preston crossings grayson county  texas  king oaks college station  texas  vintage oaks at the vineyard new braunfels  texas  and sanctuary river club at st 
andrews sound st 
simons island  georgia 
in addition  the gmac communities facility is secured by our carolina national and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses in southport  north carolina and chapel hill  north carolina  respectively 
the period during which we can add additional projects to the gmac communities facility has expired although we can continue to borrow on projects approved prior to the expiration of individual borrowing commitments ranging from june  through the maturity of the facility on september  principal payments are effected through agreed upon release prices paid to rfc  as homesites in the secured projects are sold 
interest payments are due monthly 
the gmac communities facility includes customary conditions to funding  acceleration and event of default provisions and certain financial affirmative and negative covenants 
we use the proceeds from the gmac communities facility to finance the acquisition and development of bluegreen communities projects 
during the year ended december  we borrowed million under the gmac communities facility 
during january  we borrowed an additional million under the gmac communities facility for general corporate purposes 
historically  we have funded development for road and utility construction  amenities  surveys and engineering fees from internal operations and have financed the acquisition of bluegreen communities properties through seller  bank or financial institution loans 
terms for repayment under these loans typically call for interest to be paid monthly and principal to be repaid through homesite releases 
the release price is usually an amount based on a pre determined percentage typically to of the gross selling price of the homesites in the subdivision 
in addition  the agreements generally call for minimum cumulative amortization periodically 
when we provide financing to our customers and therefore the release price is not available in cash at closing to repay the lender  we are required to pay the lender with cash derived from other operating activities  principally from cash sales or the pledge of receivables originated from earlier property sales 
trust preferred securities offerings we have formed statutory business trusts collectively  the trusts and each issued trust preferred securities and invested the proceeds thereof in our junior subordinated debentures 
the trusts are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the operations of the trusts  instead  the trusts are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in each of these transactions  the applicable trust issued trust preferred securities as part of larger pooled trust securities offerings which were not registered under the securities act of the applicable trust then used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at the same interest rate 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the company s option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we made an initial equity contribution to each trust in exchange for its common securities  all of which are owned by us  and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the terms of each trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities 
we had the following junior subordinated debentures outstanding at december  dollars in thousands trust outstanding amount of junior subordinated debentures initial equity in trust issue date fixed interest rate variable interest rate beginning optional redemption date maturity date bluegreen statutory trust i month libor bluegreen statutory trust ii month libor bluegreen statutory trust iii month libor bluegreen statutory trust iv month libor bluegreen statutory trust v month libor bluegreen statutory trust vi month libor both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a fixed interest rate from the issue date through the beginning optional redemption date 
both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a variable interest rate from the beginning optional redemption date through the maturity date 
initial equity in trust is recorded as part of other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we currently intend to seek to create similar trusts and to participate in other pooled trust preferred securities transactions in the future as a source of additional financing  subject to market conditions and other considerations 
unsecured credit facility in august  we executed agreements to renew our unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na and increase it from million to million 
amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at day libor plus 
interest is due monthly  and all outstanding amounts are due on july  the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line 
however  an aggregate of  of irrevocable letters of credit were provided under this line of credit 
this line of credit is an available source of short term liquidity for us 
commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our bluegreen resorts and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following tables summarize the contractual minimum principal and interest payments  respectively  required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases by period date  as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable senior secured notes jr 
subordinated debentures noncancelable operating leases total contractual obligations interest obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable senior secured notes jr 
subordinated debentures total contractual interest total contractual obligations assumes that the interest rate on variable rate debt remains the same as the rate at december  we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale of voi notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the principal payments required on contractual obligations 
while we believe that we will be able to meet all required debt payments when due  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we estimate that the cash required to complete resort buildings  resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred was approximately million as of december  we estimate that the total cash required to complete our bluegreen communities projects in which sales have occurred was approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next five years primarily with available capacity on existing or proposed credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing or generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we will seek to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including  our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  limits on the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  transactions with affiliates  covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during the year ended december  were approximately of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we sold million  million  and million of fixed rate voi notes receivable off balance sheet during  and  respectively  under various vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities and term securitization transactions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our gains on sale recognized are generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the hypothetical change in fair value or our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on adverse changes in assumptions including discount rate 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prevailing prime or libor rates  as applicable  would  as a result of increased interest expense on variable rate debt  decrease our after tax earnings by an immaterial amount per year  partially offset by the increased interest income on variable rate bluegreen communities notes receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
a similar change in interest rates would decrease the total fair value of our fixed rate debt  excluding our senior secured notes payable the notes by an immaterial amount 
the fact that the notes are publicly traded in the over the counter market makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the notes 
due to the non interest related factors involved in determining the fair value of these publicly traded securities  their fair values have historically demonstrated increased  decreased or at times contrary relationships to changes in interest rates as compared to other types of fixed rate debt securities 
the analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
