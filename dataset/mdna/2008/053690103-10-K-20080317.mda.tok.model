item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for a description of our assignment of rights to genzyme corporation  resulting in the generation of million of revenue in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in item a risk factors 
overview avigen is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics to treat serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders 
our current lead product candidates primarily address spasticity and neuromuscular spasm and neuropathic pain 
our goal is to retain rights to commercialize our products in north america and therefore we expect  when appropriate  to build a sales and marketing infrastructure 
we intend to seek to out license rights to develop and market our products outside the united states 
we also intend to continue to look for opportunities to expand our pipeline of compounds through a combination of internal research  acquisitions  and in licensing as appropriate 
in january  we acquired exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize proprietary formulations of the compound tolperisone  which we have named av  for the north american market 
these rights include relevant patent filings  as well as clinical data held by sdi diagnostics international ltd  a division of sanochemia pharmazeutika ag  or sanochemia  relating to av sanochemia has also agreed to supply av to us exclusively for the north american market 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an upfront payment of million and will make additional payments to sanochemia based on the parties achievement of clinical and regulatory product development milestones and sales of av we are developing av for the treatment of neuromuscular spasm and spasticity 
during  we significantly expanded the scale and complexity of our clinical development activities over prior years 
in  we initiated phase ii clinical trials for av in the us and europe and completed a phase iia clinical trial for av in australia 
we are developing av for the treatment of neuropathic pain and other indications 
the operation of these trials and other development activities resulted in a significant increase in our operating expenses during the year 
our product development plans include our intention to complete phase ii clinical trials and collect other supportive data on the safety and efficacy of each product in our portfolio in order to design robust phase iii pivotal trial programs that are acceptable to the fda and  if approved  to provide additional information that physicians and patients could use to optimize their treatment and care 
in may  we completed a private placement of common stock with institutional investors for net proceeds of million 
under the terms of the transaction avigen sold approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the transaction did not include any warrants or other enhancements 
in april  we completed an underwritten offering of our common stock with selected institutional investors 
in may  the underwriters exercised a day option to purchase additional shares to cover over allotments 
in connection with this transaction  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a negotiated purchase price of per share for total cash proceeds of million  net of underwriter discounts and other issuance costs 
prior to  avigen focused on developing a product development portfolio of dna based drug delivery technologies 
in december  we entered into an agreement with genzyme corporation  or genzyme  whereby we assigned to genzyme our rights to some of our gene therapy related intellectual property  our gene therapy clinical trial programs for parkinson s disease and hemophilia  gene therapy related contracts  and the use of previously manufactured clinical grade vector materials 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million payment and could receive additional development milestones  sublicensing fees and royalty payments based on the successful development of products by genzyme utilizing technologies previously developed by us 
in addition  if genzyme fails to diligently pursue the commercialization or marketing of products using the assigned technology  as specified in the agreement  some of the rights we assigned could revert back to avigen at a future date 
we are a development stage company and have primarily supported the financial needs of our research and development activities since our inception through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of our products in development  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that we will need to obtain additional funding to support the anticipated future needs of our research and development activities  including the costs to complete clinical trials 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under the genzyme agreement  under which we assigned to genzyme our rights to some of our gene therapy related intellectual property  our gene therapy clinical trial programs for parkinson s disease and hemophilia  some of our gene therapy related contracts  and the use of previously manufactured clinical grade vector materials  and collaborative arrangements with third parties  government grants  and non gene therapy related license fees 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to lack of any substantial revenue and the continuation of our ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture  or market our product candidates or ever achieve or sustain product revenue for profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments of approximately million 
we believe that our cash resources at december   will be adequate to fund our operating needs for at least two years 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  valuation of investments in financial instruments  impairment of property and equipment  asset retirement obligations  recognition of research and development expenses  and share based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the four basic criteria for revenue recognition as described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize non refundable license or assignment fees  including development milestone payments associated with license or assignment agreements  for which we have no further significant performance obligations and no continuing involvement requirements related to product development  on the earlier of the dates on when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
for example  in  we received a million payment under the terms of our agreement with genzyme 
we recognized the payment as revenue  since we concluded that as of december   we did not have any significant future performance obligations under the agreement 
we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the development phase 
this development phase can be defined as a specified period of time  however  in some cases  the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize this revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering the projected level of effort and current stage of development 
if our estimate of the development phase time period changes  the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front payments for a given period will accelerate or decrease accordingly 
valuation of investments in financial instruments we carry investments in financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate  asset based  and other obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if a decline in fair value of a financial instrument is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intention and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  which could be until maturity 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our financial instruments since our inception 
in addition  when management commits to holding individual securities until maturity in order to avoid the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  those securities would no longer be classified as available for sale 
in addition  management would evaluate these securities to determine whether the security  based on the remaining duration until its scheduled maturity  should be identified as a current or long term asset 
as of december   management had not designated any individual securities as held to maturity for the purposes of avoiding an other than temporary impairment 
impairment of property and equipment and asset retirement obligation we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to leased facilities we use for our research and development activities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
management assesses whether the carrying value of long lived assets is impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the total of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying value or appraised value  as appropriate 
if we judge the value of our long lived assets to be impaired  we write down the cost basis of the property and equipment to fair value and include the amount of the write down in our net loss 
in determining whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired  management considers failure of manufacturing facilities and equipment to comply with government mandated policies and procedures  failure of the product candidates for which the manufacturing facilities have been constructed to receive regulatory approval  and the extent that facilities could be idled or abandoned due to a decrease in the scope of our research and development activities for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
in  we determined that the scope of our research and development activities had changed such that we would not effectively utilize some portions of our leased facilities that had been designed to support our gene therapy programs 
after considering alternative uses for these spaces  we decided it was not cost effective to re engineer the rooms representing approximately  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory  and office space under lease through may and approximately  square feet of similar space we have under lease through november we determined we would maximize our potential cost savings by subleasing the properties 
based on market conditions for rental property at the time of the reduction in the scope of our research and development activities  and our subsequent completion of sublease agreements for approximately  square feet  we did not expect to fully recover the value invested in leasehold improvements and equipment  and reduced our net carrying value for these assets to their then current fair value  resulting in an impairment loss for the year ended december  of approximately million 
this impairment loss does not impact our cash flows and primarily represents an acceleration of depreciation charges that would have been recognized over the subsequent three and five year lease periods 
under the terms of our building lease that expires in may  we may be required  at our landlord s sole discretion  to remove  reconfigure or otherwise alter some improvements we have made to the facility 
we determine the fair value of asset retirement obligations based on our assessment of a range of possible settlement dates and amounts 
considerable management judgment is required in estimating these obligations 
important assumptions include estimates of retirement costs  the timing of the future retirement activities  and the likelihood of retirement provisions being enforced 
changes in these assumptions based on future information could result in adjustments to estimated liabilities 
as a result of a change in estimate in december  we remeasured the fair value of this contingent asset retirement obligation and recognized a liability for  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations in measuring the obligation  we applied a hypothetical increase to the expected future costs underlying the fair value calculation 
this hypothetical increase would have caused a comparable increase in the retirement charge 
the recognition of this liability would have resulted in an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying long lived assets 
however  in june  these leasehold improvements were determined to be impaired and written off with a charge to our net loss 
since there was no carrying value of the underlying assets at december   the recognition of our asset retirement obligation resulted in an additional charge in to impairment loss related to long lived assets 
as of december   there were no material changes in our expectations with regard to this obligation 
upon settlement of the obligation  we will recognize any difference between the cost to retire the asset and the liability recorded as an increase or decrease to operating expenses in our statement of operations in the year of settlement 
recognition of research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including related salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead costs  clinical trial and related drug product costs  contract services and other outside service expenses 
we charge research and development expenses to operating expense in the period incurred 
these expenses consist of costs incurred for our independent  as well as our collaborative  research and development activities 
pursuant to management s assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize expenses as the services are provided 
several of our contracts extend across multiple reporting periods 
management assessments include  but are not limited to  an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally  estimates of incurred costs by the third party service providers  and management s judgment 
the determination of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
these estimated expenses may or may not match the actual fees billed by the service providers as determined by actual work completed 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future reporting periods 
share based compensation expense effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards r  fas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  and recognize share based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of share based awards in the results of our operations 
for awards that were granted but not yet vested prior to january   we calculate the share based compensation expense using the same estimate of grant date fair value previously disclosed under fas in a pro forma manner 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the expected average life of an option 
we have available data of all grant by grant historical activity for stock options we have granted that we use in developing some of our assumptions 
we use the black scholes method to value stock options 
we estimate the expected average life of options granted based on historic behavior of our option holders and we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of our share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  fas r requires we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and only recognize expense for the portion of awards that are expected to vest 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience of our share based awards that are forfeited prior to vesting 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for calculating fair value of our share based awards  or if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in future periods 
results of operations revenue year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenue  percentage decrease over prior period n a we recognized no revenue in revenue in represented the  payments from our participation with the university of colorado on a grant that was funded by the national institutes of health 
revenue in primarily reflected the million payment received in connection with our december agreement with genzyme 
total revenue in also included research license fees of  and royalty revenue of  these revenues were associated with research license agreements and a single royalty license related to our gene therapy technologies 
as a result of the assignment of our gene therapy assets to genzyme  we are no longer a direct party to most of the license or collaboration agreements that gave rise to the revenues prior to as a result  we do not expect any significant revenues for the foreseeable future and that revenues  if any  will consist solely of payments that may be received in connection with other non gene therapy related activities 
research and development expenses we maintain a small staff and sublease portions of our leased operating facilities to reduce our overhead costs 
in addition  we use external resources to optimize the pace and cost of development of our product candidates 
as a result  our current business model reduces our exposure to fixed costs for manufacturing staff and facilities and gives us more control over the strategic timing and application of our resources 
our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions costs to support research and preclinical development  and costs to support preparation for and implementation of human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  non clinical studies to support the design of human clinical trials  and in house and independent third party validation testing of potential acquisition or in license drug candidates 
clinical development costs include activities associated with preparing for regulatory approvals  maintaining regulated and controlled processes  purchasing manufactured drug substances for use in human clinical trials  and supporting subject enrollment and subject administration within clinical trials 
at december   the staff count associated with our current research and development activities  which focus on our portfolio of small molecule candidates for the treatment of serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders  was  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the costs associated with these two primary functions of our research and development activities approximate the following in thousands  except percentages percentage year ended percentage year ended december  increase december  increase over over research and preclinical development    clinical development    total research and development expenses    because a significant percentage of our research and development resources contribute to multiple development programs  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual development programs 
we base decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation primarily on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development activities are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to complete any specific projects 
as of december   we revised the estimated useful life on some leasehold improvements with a remaining carrying value of million 
as a result of this change  we accelerated the amortization of the remaining carrying value of these assets to match the estimated remaining term on the underlying building operating lease  which expires in may as a result of this change in estimate  our research and preclinical development depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for and is expected to increase by million in from the previous schedule

comparison of years ended december  and the increases in our total research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following million higher expenditures for external research and development services from third party service providers  primarily related to an increase in external preclinical animal studies and scientific consulting work to support the progress of our lead product candidates  av and av  as both programs transitioned into a clinical development phase  and the recognition of approximately  in non cash expense for share based compensation in compliance with fas r adopted january   partially offset by  million lower personnel related expenses  reflecting a significantly lower average staff level in as a result of a staff reduction initiated in august  partially offset by higher average salaries in  and million lower depreciation expenses and amortization  primarily as a result of the impairment charges for leasehold improvements and equipment that we recognized in clinical development percentage percentage decrease year ended increase year ended increase december  december  in thousands  except percentages over over personnel related    share based compensation n a external clinical development   depreciation n a other expenses including facilities overhead  total clinical development expenses    comparison of years ended december  and the increase in our total clinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following million higher expenditures for external clinical development services from third party suppliers  associated with the ongoing support of our clinical trials for av and av  compared to costs related to the preparation and initiation of clinical trials for av and av in  and higher non cash expenses of  for the recognition of share based compensation in compliance with fas r

if we are successful in our efforts to develop our product candidates  including the completion of our ongoing and additional clinical trials over the next twelve to eighteen months and thereafter  we expect our total research and development spending in future periods to rise 
general and administrative expenses we have reclassified some prior period amounts within general and administrative expenses to conform to our current period s presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or the net cash flow from operating activities reported on our statement of cash flow

we expect our current level of general and administrative expenses to continue in however  if we are successful in our efforts to develop our product candidates  we expect general and administrative spending levels may increase to connection with the changing needs of the company 
impairment loss related to long lived assets year ended december  in thousands impairment loss related to long lived assets  in connection with the organizational and structural changes initiated in  we determined that our future operations would not require the full capacity of our leased facilities  and we began to pursue potential cost savings through a sublease 
we determined that we would not recover fully the costs of our investment in leasehold improvements to the building and recorded an impairment charge of million in  to reduce the carrying value of some leasehold improvements and equipment to zero 
this amount did not impact our cash flows in in  we recognized a contingent asset retirement obligation associated with some leasehold improvements which we determined to be impaired in since the carrying value for these assets had been reduced to zero  the recognition of the liability resulted in an additional impairment loss related to long lived assets in in license fees year ended december  in thousands in license fees  in january  we entered into a license agreement and paid sanochemia a fee of million as consideration for an exclusive license to develop and commercialize proprietary formulations of the compound tolperisone  which we have named av  for the north american market 
we did not enter into any in license agreements in or interest expense year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest expense percentage increase over prior period the increase in our interest expense between and reflects a rise in the average annual rate of interest charged during this period on our line of credit  which bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  and is reset in three or six month increments 
on december   we repaid million of our outstanding borrowings and reduced our loan payable at december  to million 
this should result in lower interest expense in future periods 
interest income year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest income    percentage increase decrease over prior period almost all of our interest income is generated from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt 
the increase in interest income between and primarily reflects the higher average outstanding balance of our total portfolio  including million received from genzyme in december  the million net cash proceeds from the private placement completed in may  and the million net cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock in connection with the underwritten offering in april  as well as the impact of the increase in average yields earned on the portfolio 
sublease income year ended december  in thousands sublease income during  we subleased  square feet of our aggregate facilities in two buildings to four separate corporate tenants not affiliated with avigen 
effective december   we entered into a termination of sublease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space originally sublet through november unless we are able to enter into additional sublease agreements after december   we expect to recognize remaining contractual  sublease income of million ratably over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire in may and november recently issued accounting standards see note  summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements  in the notes to our financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on avigen  which discussion is incorporated by reference here 
deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might generate taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  upon adoption of fin  we determined that we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing fin liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
between may  the date of our initial public offering  and december  we raised million from private placements and public offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
in april  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten offering to selected institutional investors for total net cash proceeds of million after deducting underwriter discounts and other issuance costs of million 
in may  we completed a private placement of common stock with institutional investors  raising approximately million in net cash proceeds 
the transaction represented the sale of approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
there were no warrants or other enhancements included in the transaction 
in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  in december we received a million payment from genzyme in connection with the assignment of rights to most of our previously developed gene therapy based intellectual property  some clinical trials and other gene therapy assets 
we have also attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow by renting facilities  subleasing facilities no longer critical to our future operations  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional cash expenditures  as we continue our research and development activities  including our efforts to develop  manufacture  and commercialize our current drug candidates  expand our product portfolio with additional development candidates through internal research  acquisition or in licensing  and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted investments  of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  at december  and  the portion of our investment portfolio pledged as collateral  which we refer to as restricted investments  includes million and million  respectively  for outstanding borrowings against our credit facility and approximately million in each year for letters of credit which serve as security deposits on our building leases 
the classification of  of these restricted investments as current assets at december  results from the classification of the underlying building lease liability that expires in may  as a current liability 
the classification of million of these restricted investments as non current assets at december  results from the classification of our related loan payable that is due in november  and the underlying building lease liability that expires in november  as long term liabilities 
the reduction of million in total restricted investments between and was the result of a repayment of outstanding borrowings in december which removed the need for the pledged investments 
we do not consider our restricted investments a current source of additional liquidity 
effective june   we amended the terms of our credit facility with wells fargo bank to extend the repayment period on million of outstanding borrowings until november under the terms of the amendment  we are able to make partial or full repayments of principal at any time  however  amounts repaid cannot be re borrowed during the term of the credit facility 
in addition  wells fargo bank will maintain our million of currently outstanding standby letters of credit pursuant to the terms required under our building operating leases that expire in november and may operating activities 
net cash used for operating activities was million for compared to million for the amount was primarily used to support our clinical research and development activities  including non clinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties 
the amount includes the payment of million during the year to sanochemia in connection with our in license agreement for av the remainder of the cash we used in operating activities for both years was primarily used to support our internal research and development activities  and general and administrative expenses 
net cash used for operating activities in was million 
the increase in the amount of cash used in compared to is primarily due to higher expenditures to support our research and development activities in  including preclinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties  partially offset by the impact of the receipt of million in in connection with our transaction with genzyme 
the level of cash used in operating activities during and were in line with management s expectations 
investing and financing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale securities  net of sales and maturities  and a reduction in restricted investments 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively  and consisted of million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in connection with the underwritten offering in april and million of net proceeds from the private placement of out common stock to institutional investors in may  as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options during both years 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities in was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases  and the reduction in restricted investments  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment of  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year 
the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of previously issued stock options and warrants are determined by the decisions of the respective option and warrant holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds received from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be received in future periods 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations net of sublease income  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period less than contractual commitment total year years years operating leases    credit facility   research funding for third parties   total    our credit facility is scheduled to expire on november   at which point a balloon payment of outstanding principal is due 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  which is reset in three or six month increments based on the date of each original drawdown  until expiration 
as of december  and  the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately and  respectively 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the credit facility 
at december   we had borrowed million from the credit vehicle and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with our property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november in addition  in august  we amended our lease agreement expiring in may to extend the expiration period on approximately  square feet of laboratory space through november payments scheduled under our lease commitments are included in the table above under operating leases 
between and  we completed sublease agreements for approximately of our leased facilities in order to reduce the costs of our future lease obligations 
each sublease agreement runs concurrent with the duration of our underlying master lease term for the respective building 
in december  we entered into a termination of sublease agreement for approximately  square feet  or  of our leased facilities  through november payments scheduled under our remaining sublease agreements total approximately  through under the terms of our building lease that expires in may  we may be required  at our landlord s sole discretion  to remove  reconfigure or otherwise alter some improvements we have made to the facility 
if the landlord requires us to do so  this would impact our cash flows in future periods 
as discussed above in critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates impairment of property and equipment and asset retirement obligation  we remeasured the fair value of this contingent asset retirement obligation  and recognized a liability of  and  at december  and  respectively 
we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable by either party  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that by keeping our staff level low and relying on a business model that allows us to leverage efficiencies through out sourced service providers  our financial resources as of december  will be adequate to fund our projected operating needs for at least two years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding our future operating and capital requirements  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs involved in obtaining licenses to patented technologies from third parties that may be needed to commercialize our product candidates  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and sales  the costs of sales  marketing and commercialization activities  how successful  if at all  we are at acquiring or in licensing additional compounds  and the nature of the consideration we pay for acquired or in licensed compounds  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we will need to obtain additional funding before we will be able to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to other market risks 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than five years and an average aggregate portfolio duration of between one and three years 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december  and  consisted of fixed rate securities and did not include any holdings of auction rate securities 
we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately  our estimated exposure at december  is higher than the estimated  exposure at december  primarily due to the higher dollar amount of short term investments in the portfolio 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes million in borrowings under our credit facility that expires in november interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three and six month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowings was approximately compared to as of december
