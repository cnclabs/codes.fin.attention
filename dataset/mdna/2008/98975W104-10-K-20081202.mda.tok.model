critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
we are a leader in the commercialization of carbon fiber through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products which we sell under the panex trade name 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fiber  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications which we sell under the pyron trade name 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we are the largest manufacturer primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fiber for commercial applications 
the following factors have affected the net sales of our carbon fiber segment in recent years the growth in emerging applications using carbon fiber  such as wind turbines  increases in our manufacturing capacity  and sellers prices 
we would expect that our net sales in future periods will continue to be affected by the first and second of these factors 
although we implemented selected price increases as of january   we cannot predict whether we will be able to implement future price increases similar to those we implemented in the recent past 
the net sales of our technical fiber segment have been affected in the past  and we expect will continue to be affected in the foreseeable future  by the demand and order patterns resulting from aircraft brake manufacturers 
the primary cost components of our carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are energy and acrylonitrile  which is a propylene based product and our primary raw material for the production of acrylic fiber precursor used in our carbon fiber and technical fiber production 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products

the reserves reflect management s estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matters and are revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when matters are brought to closure 
if any litigation matter is resolved unfavorably  the company could incur obligations in excess of management s estimate of the outcome  and such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
as of september   the company has established an accrual for legal liabilities of million 
in addition  we will incur additional legal costs in connection with pursuing and defending such actions 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant legal matters 
critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements  and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivables was million for  million for and million for inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to a long lived asset or a group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
stock based compensation on october   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
under the modified prospective method of adopting sfas no 
r  the company recognized compensation cost for all share based payments granted after october   plus any awards granted to employees prior to october  that remain unvested at that time 
under this method of adoption  no restatement of prior periods was made 
the company uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option 
however  the company only calculates the volatility of the company s stock back to november  the date the company received its first large order for carbon fiber  as that is when the company considers its business to have changed from a research and development company to an operational company 
management believes this is a better measurement of the company s stock volatility

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility and other variable rate debt 
assuming the current level of borrowings of million at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated our interest expense for the twelve months ended september  would have changed by approximately million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would seek to take actions to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
further  no consideration has been given to the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
the company does not believe such risk is material because a significant amount of the company s current debt is at fixed rates 
at september   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
the consolidated balance sheet of the company s international subsidiaries  zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico  were translated from hungarian forints and mexican pesos to us dollars  respectively  at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date  while its consolidated statements of operations were translated using the average exchange rates in effect for the periods presented 
the related translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions of zoltek zrt 
are included in the results of operations in other expenses 
the company views as long term its investments in zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico  which have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency risks related to these investments 
the company does not currently employ a foreign currency hedging strategy related to the sales from hungary or mexico 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  the company is exposed to zoltek zrt 
s and zoltek de mexico s functional currency  which is the hungarian forint and the mexican peso  respectively 
neither hungary nor mexico is considered to be a highly inflationary or deflationary economy 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek zrt 
subsidiary of million 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek zrt 
resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the hungarian forint against the us dollar at september  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the near future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
in addition  zoltek zrt 
routinely sells its products to customers located primarily throughout europe in sales transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
also  zoltek zrt 
has debt that is denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek de mexico subsidiary 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek de mexico of million resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the mexican peso against the us dollar at september  would have amounted to million 
the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the near future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
in january  march and october of and february  the company issued convertible notes and warrants which would require the company to register the resale of the shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of these securities 
the company accounts for the fair value of these outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and conversion feature of its convertible notes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and eitf issue no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock  which requires the company to separately account for the conversion feature and warrants as embedded derivatives contained in the company s convertible notes 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company separates the fair value of the conversion feature from the convertible notes  since the conversion feature was determined to not be clearly and closely related to the debt host 
in addition  since the effective registration of the securities underlying the conversion feature and warrants is an event outside of the control of the company  pursuant to eitf issue no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the conversion feature and warrants as long term liabilities as it was assumed that the company would be required to net cash settle the underlying securities 
the company is required to carry these embedded derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value  which was million at september  all such derivative financial instruments have been fully exercised or converted as of september  any unrealized changes  which are an inverse relation to changes in the company s stock price  in the values of these embedded derivatives are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on value of warrants and conversion feature 
since these gains and loss are non cash in nature the company does not expect to employ a type of hedging strategy related to these transactions
