recent developments and overview we build and operate wireless broadband networks that enable fast  simple  portable  reliable and affordable communications 
our networks cover entire communities  delivering a wireless high speed internet connection and enabling other services and features that create a new communications path into the home or office 
we provide a portable broadband connection that delivers high speed internet access and enables premium services  such as voip telephony  anytime and anywhere within our coverage area our pre wimax network relies on network infrastructure equipment that is based on non line of sight  or nlos  orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  or ofdm  expedience technologies  from motorola  inc we 
table of contents intend to deploy networks based on the ieee mobile worldwide interoperability of microwave access e  or mobile wimax  standard in all new markets 
as with our current pre wimax network infrastructure equipment  we expect mobile wimax technology to support fixed  portable and mobile service offerings using a single network architecture 
in addition  as mobile wimax is a standards based technology  we anticipate manufacturers will offer a number of handheld communications and consumer electronic devices that will be enabled to communicate using our mobile wimax network  including notebook computers  ultramobile personal computers  or umpcs  personal data assistants  or pdas  gaming consoles  mp players  and other handheld devices 
we expect to launch our first mobile wimax markets in the second half of  provided the wimax technologies satisfactorily pass our ongoing field trials 
we launched our first broadband market in august and are growing rapidly in terms of the number of markets served  number of people covered by our network  and number of total subscribers 
as of december  we offered our service for sale to an estimated million people  or pops  in the united states and to nearly million pops internationally in ghent and brussels  belgium  dublin  ireland  and seville  spain 
we believe that our subscriber growth rates reflect robust customer demand for our services 
we ended with approximately  total subscribers worldwide representing a increase in subscribers or approximately  net new subscribers from the approximately  total subscribers we had as of december  our subscriber base grew by  from the approximately  total subscribers we had as of december  as of december   we had approximately  customers in the united states  representing an increase of  or increase from the approximately  us subscribers we had as of december  this also represents a  increase from the approximately  us subscribers we had as of december  internationally  we ended with approximately  customers  representing a  or increase from the approximately  subscribers we had as of december  and a  increase from the approximately  subscribers we had as of december  we are investing heavily in building networks and growing our subscriber base 
our efforts also include offering premium services and applications in order to make our service more attractive  such as voip telephony and our recently introduced pc card 
this expansion will require significant capital expenditures as well as increased sales and marketing expenses  and will likely be accompanied by significant operating losses over the next five years or more as we expand the area covered by our network and invest to build our brand and develop subscriber loyalty 
we expect to launch additional markets in the united states during if introduced on the schedule we anticipate  these market launches would expand our covered population in the united states to approximately to million in we believe we may have  to  total subscribers in both our us and international markets by the end of we believe that we have the second largest spectrum position in the ghz mhz band in the united states with a spectrum portfolio that as of december  includes approximately billion mhz pops  an industry metric that represents the amount of spectrum in a given area  measured in megahertz  multiplied by the estimated population of that area 
in europe  as of december   we held approximately billion mhz pops of spectrum  predominantly in the ghz band  in belgium  germany  ireland  poland  romania and spain 
we plan to continue acquiring spectrum in markets that we believe are attractive for our service offerings 
if demand increases for spectrum rights  our spectrum acquisition costs may increase  which may afford an advantage to competitors with greater capital resources 
we engineer our networks to optimize both the services that we offer and the number of subscribers to whom we can offer service 
consequently  we have not launched our services in a market using our current technology unless we control a minimum of six channels of spectrum that contain at least mhz of spectrum each 
however  we expect the spectral efficiency of technologies we deploy to continue to evolve  and as a result  we may decide to deploy our services in some markets with less spectrum 
alternatively  we could find that new technologies and subscriber usage patterns require us to have more spectrum available in our markets 
as a result of continued expansion and ongoing spectrum acquisitions  we expect to require significant additional capital  which we intend to raise through subsequent equity offerings  by increasing our debt  or a combination of the two 
as of december   our total assets were billion and our stockholders equity 
table of contents was billion  which compares to total assets of billion and stockholders equity of billion at december  our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and unrestricted short term and long term investments were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
as a consequence of the particularly turbulent financial markets of late  we cannot offer assurances that the necessary capital to achieve our current plan will be available on attractive terms or at all  and we plan to manage our use of capital by adjusting the rate at which we build our network  acquire spectrum and deploy our services 
as we have concentrated our financial and management resources on expanding the geographic footprint of our network and the availability of our services  we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on may   we closed an agreement with bellsouth corporation to acquire for an aggregate price of million all interests in sft spectrum  llc and bwc spectrum  llc  which collectively held all of at t inc s leases and licenses for ghz spectrum 
these entities were wholly owned subsidiaries of bellsouth corporation  which is wholly owned by at t  inc as a result of a merger that closed in december based on the terms of the agreement  the acquisition was treated as a purchase of assets under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
we finalized the allocation estimates during the third quarter of and recorded million as purchased spectrum rights and million as leased spectrum based on the fair values of the owned and leased spectrum 
in an effort to simplify our capital structure  access incremental borrowing availability  and extend our debt maturities  on july   we entered into a senior term loan facility providing for loans of up to billion 
we borrowed million under the senior term loan facility on the date of closing and repaid obligations under the million term loan  including fees and costs attributable to the senior term loan facility 
on august   we borrowed the remaining amount of approximately million under the senior term loan facility  and fully retired our senior secured notes  originally due  for a price of of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately million plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and the remaining portion of the interest escrow 
the billion senior secured term loan facility provides for quarterly amortization payments aggregating an annual amount equal to of the original principal amount of the term loans prior to the maturity date  with the remaining balance due on july  in general  borrowings under the new senior term loan facility bear interest based  at our option  at either the eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate  in each case plus a margin 
the rate of interest for borrowings under the new senior term loan facility is the eurodollar rate plus or the alternate base rate plus  with interest payable quarterly with respect to alternate base rate loans  and with respect to eurodollar loans  interest is payable in arrears at the end of each applicable period  but at least every three months 
in connection with the repayment of the million term loan and the retirement of the million senior secured notes due  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of debt  which was primarily due to the write off of the unamortized portion of the proceeds allocated to the warrants originally issued in connection with the senior secured notes and the related deferred financing costs 
in connection with the billion senior term loan facility  we recorded a deferred financing cost of million which is being amortized over the five year term of the loan 
on november   we entered into an amendment to provide us with an additional million in term loans under our senior term loan facility 
we recorded a deferred financing cost of million related to this additional funding  which is being amortized over the remaining term of the loan 
this additional funding  which closed on the same date  increases the size of our senior secured term loan facility to billion 
we will use the proceeds to further support our expansion plans and for general corporate purposes 
the material terms of the incremental term loans are the same as the terms of the loans under the original senior term loan facility 
in an effort to reduce interest expense on our senior term loan facility  in january  we entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge our forward three month libor indexed variable interest payments 
the first swap was entered on january   effective march   to pay a fixed rate of and to receive the three month libor on a notional value of million for three years 
the second swap was entered on january   effective march   to pay a fixed rate of and to receive the three month libor on a notional value of 
table of contents million for two years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 its amendments and related guidance  we will treat the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and will record the fair value of the swaps at the end of each calendar quarter  beginning march  at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value of a total of million and a cost of million  of which investments with a fair value of million and a cost of million were in auction rate securities and an investment with a fair value of million and a cost of million was in commercial paper issued by a structured investment vehicle for which an insolvency event has been declared 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on this investment of million during auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset approximately every or days through an auction process 
beginning in august  the auctions failed to attract buyers and sell orders could not be filled 
current market conditions do not allow us to estimate when the auctions will resume 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  until the auctions resume  the investments are not liquid and we may not have access to these funds until a future auction on these investments is successful 
at december   the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates cost and we recorded other than temporary impairment losses and realized losses on our auction rate securities of million for the year ended december  for certain other auction rate securities  we recorded an unrealized loss of million in other comprehensive income reflecting the decline in the estimated fair value of these securities 
we consider these declines in fair value to be temporary given our consideration of the collateral underlying these securities and our conclusion that the declines are related to changes in interest rates rather than any credit concerns related to the underlying assets 
additionally  we believe we have the intent and ability to hold the investments until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
business segments the company complies with the requirements of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s operating segments and related disclosures about its products  services  geographic areas and major customers 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
operating segments can be aggregated for segment reporting purposes so long as certain aggregation criteria are met 
the company defines the chief operating decision makers as our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
as our business continues to mature  the company assesses how it views and operates the business 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of the company was organized into two reportable business segments the united states and the international business 
see note  business segments  for further discussion 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to investments  long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  including spectrum  share based compensation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our accounting policies require management to make complex and subjective judgments 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates 
table of contents are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial statements  the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
in consultation with our board of directors  we have identified the following accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements revenue recognition  impairments of long lived assets  impairments of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  share based compensation  valuation of common stock  accounting for spectrum licenses and leases  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and investments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  when all of the following conditions exist i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists in the form of an accepted purchase order  ii delivery has occurred  based on shipping terms  or services have been rendered  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  as documented on the accepted purchase order  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we primarily earn service revenue by providing access to our wireless broadband network 
also included in service revenue are revenue from optional services  including voip service  personal and business email and static internet protocol 
activation fees are charged to customers when initiating a service subscription 
we apply eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to account for revenue arrangements with activation and service components 
these arrangements are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative fair values if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
service revenue from customers for the wireless broadband and optional services are billed in advance and recognized ratably over the service period 
activation fees charged to the customer are deferred and recognized as service revenue on a straight line basis over the expected life of the customer relationship  which we have estimated to be years 
this expected life was determined based on our assessment of industry averages and our assessment of data on the duration of a customer life and average monthly churn 
revenue associated with the shipment of cpe and other equipment to our customers is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
generally  the risks of ownership and title pass when product is delivered to our customer 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded to service revenue 
prior to our sale of nextnet in august  we primarily earned equipment revenue from sales to third party network providers of base stations  cpe  related infrastructure  system services and software maintenance contracts 
with the nextnet arrangements that included multiple elements including software  such as the sale of a base station with a software maintenance contract  we applied the accounting guidance in accordance with statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenue was allocated to each element of the transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement was based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
revenue was deferred for any undelivered elements and revenue was recognized when the product was delivered or over the period in which the service is performed 
if we could not objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in the bundled product and software maintenance arrangements  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
if the fair value of a delivered element had not been established  we would use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements was determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements was deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee was allocated to the delivered elements and was recognized as revenue 

table of contents fees for software maintenance services were typically billed annually in advance of performance of the services with provisions for subsequent annual renewals 
we deferred the related revenues and recognized them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically were one to two years 
impairments of long lived assets we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  for recoverability whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projections of continuing losses associated with use of the asset  a significant change in our business or technology strategy  such as a switch to mobile wimax wireless broadband network  a significant change in our management s views of growth rates for our business  and a significant change in the anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
we frequently evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred 
as our losses to date are a direct result of expanding our business to support our growth  we have not considered our losses to date as an event that indicates that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  there have been no other impairment indicators for any of our asset groups 
when such events or circumstances exist  we would determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value by estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset 
for purposes of recognition and measurement  we group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
changes in technology used in our business  such as a transition to mobile wimax  may result in an impairment in the value or a change in the estimated useful life of our expedience network equipment already placed in service 
if and when such a change occurs  we may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of equipment in service to its fair value  and or to accelerate the useful life of the respective equipment 
this may result in an increase in periodic depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the equipment  or  in appropriate instances  a write off of a portion or the entire net book value of the equipment 
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of such asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  any of which could trigger an impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents our owned spectrum licenses in the united states  belgium and ireland have indefinite useful lives  and were evaluated for impairment testing purposes as a single unit of accounting for each country  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
we complete a two step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment 
the first step involves comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if any impairment exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered to be impaired and the second step is performed 
the second step involves comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating fair value to the various assets and liabilities within the reporting unit in the same manner goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
in calculating an impairment charge  the fair value of the impaired reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology or by reference to recent comparable transactions 
in making our assessment  we rely on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  and anticipated future cash flows 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying these factors to our goodwill impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of october   and concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the united states and internationally consist mainly of our spectrum licenses originally issued by the fcc  trade names and trademarks 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the fair value is determined by estimating the discounted future cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of  the asset 
we performed our annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets for each country of operation as of october   and concluded that there was no impairment of these intangible assets 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation costs  net of a forfeiture rate  for those shares expected to vest on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we recognized million  million  and million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost  the majority of which will be recognized over approximately the next years 
going forward  stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method  which in this case  is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  or bsm  to estimate the fair value of stock options which requires complex and judgmental assumptions including estimated stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the option and future forfeitures 
the computation of expected volatility is based on an average historical volatility from common shares of a group of our peers as well as our own historical volatility 
the expected life of options granted is based on the simplified calculation of expected life  described in sab no 
 share based payment  due to lack of option exercise history 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially for future grants as compared to the current period 
see note  share based payments  of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or rsus that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical 
table of contents employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods 
valuation of common stock prior to our initial public offering  members of our management possessing the requisite valuation experience estimated the fair value of our capital stock in connection with our stock option grants  stock awards  and other equity based compensation arrangements 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations prepared by an unrelated valuation specialist at the time of each stock option issuance because we believe our management possessed the requisite valuation expertise to prepare a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the interests at the time of each issuance since inception 
the determination of the fair value of our common stock prior to our initial public offering required management to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective 
management used the market approach to estimate the value of our enterprise at each date options were granted and at each reporting date 
under the market approach  a transaction based method was used to estimate the value of our enterprise based on transactions involving capital stock with unrelated investors and other third parties 
this approach assumes that such transactions constitute the best evidence as to the fair value of our common stock 
sales of our capital stock for cash during the years ended december   and were as follows number of shares price per share gross proceeds march june august october march total of this amount   shares were sold to a related party 
of this amount   shares were sold to a related party 
additionally  we used the best information available to corroborate our determination  including events affecting the fair value of our common stock during the year  such as the implementation of our business strategy  including the achievement of significant qualitative and quantitative milestones relating to  among others things  the number of markets launched  subscriber growth  revenue growth  spectrum licenses acquired or leased  employee growth and the execution of strategic transactions  the exercise price of warrants for the purchase of our common stock issued to both related parties and third parties  the terms of cash sale transactions for the purchase of our common stock by related parties  and the terms of non cash transactions in which related parties received our common stock as consideration 
in evaluating each of these events  we assumed that such transactions provided additional corroborating evidence as to the fair value of our capital stock 
for those transactions involving related parties  the facts and circumstances present were reviewed to evaluate whether the terms of these agreements differed materially from those that would have existed in an arms length transaction with an unrelated party 
this evaluation was performed by comparing those related party transactions to similar transactions with unrelated parties 
we further corroborated the estimate of fair value by calculating the enterprise value using the income approach at various points throughout the year 
the income approach applies an appropriate discount rate to an estimate of the future cash flows based on our forecasts of revenues  costs and capital expenditures 
given that we are an early stage company  forecasting these cash inflows and outflows required us to make judgments that were substantially more complex and inherently more subjective than those that would be required in a mature business 

table of contents as such  we determined that the market approach was a more accurate method of estimating fair value and relied on the income approach for corroboration only 
accounting for spectrum licenses and leases we have two types of arrangements for spectrum licenses in the united states direct licenses from the fcc which we own and leases or subleases from third parties that own or lease one or more fcc licenses 
the owned fcc licenses in the united states and internationally are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but must be assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
we performed our annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  and concluded that there was no impairment of these intangible assets 
for leases involving significant up front payments  we account for such payments as prepaid spectrum license fees 
we account for the spectrum lease arrangements as executory contracts which are similar to operating leases 
for leases containing scheduled rent escalation clauses we record minimum rental payments on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  including the renewal periods as appropriate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our limited operating history  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income loss  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  which was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
investments sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we classify marketable debt and equity securities that are available for current operations as short term available for sale investments  and are stated at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
losses are recognized when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the specific identification method 
we review our short term and long term investments on an ongoing basis for indicators of other than temporary impairment  and this determination requires significant judgment 
we have an investment portfolio comprised of marketable debt and equity securities including commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  auction rate securities and other securities 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current estimated fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
in determining fair value  we use quoted prices in active markets where such prices are available  or we use models to estimate fair value using various methods including the market  income and cost approaches 
for 
table of contents investments where we use models to estimate fair value in the absence of quoted market prices  we often utilize certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investment  including assumptions about risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs are readily observable  market corroborated  or unobservable company inputs 
we estimated the fair value of securities without quoted market prices using internally generated pricing models that require various inputs and assumptions 
we believe that our pricing models  inputs and assumptions are what market participants would use in pricing the securities 
we maximize the use of observable inputs to the pricing models where quoted market prices from securities and derivatives exchanges are available and reliable 
we typically receive external valuation information for us treasuries  other us government and agency securities  as well as certain corporate debt securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit 
we also use certain unobservable inputs that cannot be validated by reference to a readily observable market or exchange data and rely  to a certain extent  on management s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the security 
our internally generated pricing models may include our own data and require us to use our judgment in interpreting relevant market data  matters of uncertainty and matters that are inherently subjective in nature 
we use many factors that are necessary to estimate market values  including  interest rates  market risks  market spreads  and timing of cash flows  market liquidity  and review of underlying collateral and principal  interest and dividend payments 
the use of different judgments and assumptions could result in different presentations of pricing and security prices could change significantly based on market conditions

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
service revenue is primarily generated from subscription and modem lease fees for our wireless broadband service 
revenue from our acquired businesses  activation fees and fees for other services such as email  voip  and web hosting services are also included in service revenue 
our equipment and other revenue include sales of nextnet equipment through the date of sale of nextnet in august total revenue increased million to million in from million in this includes an million increase in service revenue as we increased our subscriber base  offset partially by a decrease in equipment revenue of million from our nextnet operations due to the sale of nextnet in august service revenues were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  as of december   we operated in us markets and four international markets covering a geographic area containing approximately million people 
this is compared to us and two international markets covering approximately million people as of december  total subscribers in all markets grew from approximately  as of december  to approximately  as of december   primarily due to continued subscriber growth in existing markets and the additional markets launched during we expect service revenues to increase in as we expect our subscribers to increase to approximately  to  revenue in the us represented and international represented of total revenue in compared to and in  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the increase in subscribers internationally which grew over the prior year compared to an increase in us subscribers 
equipment and other revenue in the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  due to the sale of nextnet in august cost of goods and services 
service costs primarily include costs associated with tower rents  direct internet access costs and back haul costs  which is the transporting of data traffic between distributed sites and a central point in the market or point of presence pop 
our cost of equipment consists of costs incurred for equipment manufactured by nextnet through august there were no costs related to equipment in the year ended december  due to the sale of nextnet in august total cost of goods and services increased million to million in from million in cost of services were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the number of sites on air  direct internet access and related back haul costs  as the number of on air sites increased to approximately  at december  compared to approximately  at december  in both and  in anticipation of build out and future market launches  we also had tower lease expenses for markets under construction 
as a percentage of service revenue  cost of service decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   primarily as a result of our costs of services rising at a slower rate as compared to our revenues generated from our increased subscriber base 
while our cost of service will increase as we continue to expand our network  we anticipate that cost of service as a percent of revenue will fluctuate due to new market launches and growth in subscribers 
based on the company s current circumstances  most of our new market launches are scheduled for late in the year 
as a consequence we expect steady improvement in cost of service as a percentage of revenue during the first part of the year  with some reduction late in the year as new market launches occur 
us cost of goods and services represented approximately and international represented approximately of total cost of goods and services in compared to approximately and approximately in  respectively 
this increase in us costs of goods and services as a percent of total cost of goods and services is due primarily to increase lease and site costs related to an increased number of sites being built out in the us as compared to international 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense primarily includes salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses and related facilities costs for the following personnel sales  marketing  network deployment  executive  finance  information technology  human resource and legal 
it also includes costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs and third party professional service fees 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to a million increase in employee compensation and related costs  including facilities costs  resulting from higher employee headcount of approximately  employees at december  compared to approximately  employees at december  these additional employees were hired as a result of bringing customer care in house  new market deployments  and to support the overall growth of our business

the remaining increase of million resulted from increases in other miscellaneous expenses primarily arising out of growth in our business 
as a result of expense controls  slower growth in headcount and fewer planned market launches in  we expect that our selling  general  and administrative expenses will begin to flatten over the course of the year 
we expect that any increases will primarily be related to marketing expenses necessary to support our growth and our efforts to build brand awareness through advertising and promotional activities  and our network expansion 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related benefits for our development personnel 
research and development expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was due to prior period expenses related to nextnet product research that were not recurring in due to the sale of nextnet in august research and development expenses may increase in as a result of system and technical development efforts related to implementation of mobile wimax 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the additional network build out and the cost of cpe related to our expansion into new markets and associated subscriber growth 
capital expenditures for depreciable property  plant and equipment increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the majority of these expenditures relate to the construction of our network and purchases of base station equipment 
spectrum lease expense 
spectrum lease expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total spectrum lease expense increased as a direct result of a significant increase in the number of spectrum leased held by us  including the additional spectrum from the bellsouth transaction  as well as an increase in the cost of new spectrum leases 
as certain of our leases include escalation clauses  we are required to record expense on a straight line basis over the term of these leases  including renewal periods where appropriate  which in combination with the significant lease obligation paid up front results in significant non cash lease expenses 
we expect spectrum lease expense to continue to increase 
gain on sale of nextnet 
in august we sold our nextnet operations and recorded a gain on sale of million 
interest income 
we recognized million of interest income for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to the higher balances of short term and long term investments held during compared to interest expense 
we incurred million of interest expense in year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in interest expenses was primarily due to an increase in debt  as debt increased by million to billion at december  from million at 
table of contents december  we recorded amortization of original issuance discount of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we recorded amortization of deferred financing costs related to our secured notes and senior term loan facility of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these amounts were partially offset by capitalized interest of million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  loss on extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the retirement of the million senior secured notes due and the repayment of the million term loan  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of debt  which was primarily due to the write off of the unamortized portion of the proceeds allocated to the warrants originally issued in connection with the senior secured notes and the related deferred financing costs 
other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments the increase in the other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investment securities of million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to the recognition of a decline in value of investment securities which we determined to be other than temporary 
at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value of million and a cost of million 
included in our investments were auction rate securities with a fair value of million and a cost of million 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset approximately every or days through an auction process 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
at december   the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates cost and we recorded other than temporary impairment losses and realized losses on our auction rate securities of million for the year ended december  for certain other auction rate securities  we recorded an unrealized loss of million in other comprehensive income reflecting the decline in the estimated fair value of these securities 
we consider these declines in fair value to be temporary given our consideration of the collateral underlying these securities and our conclusion that the declines are related to changes in interest rates rather than any credit concerns related to the underlying assets 
additionally  we have the intent and ability to hold the investments until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the company s investments in auction rate securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by preferred equity securities of small to medium sized insurance companies and financial institutions and asset backed capital commitment securities supported by high grade  short term commercial paper and a put option from a monoline insurance company 
these auction rate securities were rated aaa aaa or aa aa by standard poors and moody s rating services at the time of purchase and their ratings have not changed as of december  with regards to the asset backed capital commitment securities  both rating agencies have placed the issuers ratings under review for possible downgrade 
in addition to the above mentioned securities  we hold one commercial paper security issued by a structured investment vehicle that was placed in receivership in september for which an insolvency event was declared by the receiver in october the issuer invests in residential and commercial mortgages and other structured credits 
some of the assets consist of sub prime mortgages 
at december   the estimated fair value of this security was million based on prices provided from our internally generated pricing models and our evaluation of the value of the underlying collateral and our position in the structured investment vehicle 
during we had realized other than temporary impairment losses of million related to this commercial paper security 
a restructuring plan for this security is expected by mid as issuers and counterparties to the company s investments announce financial results in the coming quarters  it is possible that the company may record additional losses and realize losses that are currently unrealized 
the company will continue to monitor its investments for substantive changes in relevant market conditions  
table of contents substantive changes in the financial condition and performance of the investments issuers and other substantive changes in these investments 
the stated maturity of these securities is longer than years  however  because we considered them to be highly liquid and available for operations  our convention was to use the next auction date  which occurs every to days  as the effective maturity date and these securities were recorded as short term investments 
current market conditions do not allow the company to estimate when the auctions for its auction rate securities will resume 
as a result  during the company reclassified its auction rate securities from short term investments to long term investments

changes in technology customarily used in our business  such as a transition to mobile wimax  may result in an impairment in the value or a change in the estimated useful life of our pre wimax network equipment already placed in service 
if such a change occurs  we may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of equipment in service to its fair value  and to accelerate the useful life of the respective equipment  resulting in an increase in periodic depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the equipment  or  in appropriate instances  to write off the entire unamortized value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our new senior term loan facility 
we have a total outstanding balance on our senior term loan facility of billion at december  the rate of interest for borrowings under the senior term loan facility is the eurodollar rate plus or the alternate base rate plus  with interest payable quarterly with respect to alternate base rate loans  and with respect to eurodollar loans  interest is payable in arrears at the end of each applicable period  but at least every three months 
the weighted average interest rate under this facility was at december  a one percent increase in the interest rate on the outstanding principal balance at december   would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million per year 
in an effort to reduce interest expense on our senior term loan facility  in january  the company entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge its forward three month libor indexed variable interest payments in an effort to reduce interest expense 
the first swap was entered on january   effective march   to pay a fixed 
table of contents rate of and to receive the three month libor on a notional value of million for three years 
the second swap was entered on january   effective march   to pay a fixed rate of and to receive the three month libor on a notional value of million for two years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 its amendments and related guidance  the company will treat the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and will record the fair value of the swaps at the end of each calendar quarter  starting march  foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to our international operations 
we currently do not hedge our currency exchange rate risk and  as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against other currencies 
our international subsidiaries and equity investees generally use the currency of the jurisdiction in which they reside  or local currency  as their functional currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the reporting period 
the effects of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains losses as a component of net loss 
we do not expect the effects of changes in exchange rates to be material 
investment risk at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value of million and a cost of million  of which investments with a fair value of million and a cost of million were auction rate securities and million were government and agency issues  bonds and commercial paper 
we regularly review the carrying value of our short term and long term investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary  which we experienced with our auction rate securities during the year ended december  the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the credit markets in general  company specific circumstances  and changes in general economic conditions 
based on the fair value of the auction rate securities we held at december  of million  an assumed   and adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately million  million  or million 
beginning in august  the auctions failed to attract buyers and sell orders could not be filled 
current market conditions are such that we are unable to estimate when the auctions will resume 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates cost and until the auctions are successful the investments are not liquid 
we may not have access to these funds until a future auction on these investments is successful 
our investments in auction rate securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by preferred equity securities of small to medium sized insurance companies and financial institutions and asset backed capital commitment securities supported by high grade  short term commercial paper and a put option from a monoline insurance company 
these auction rate securities were rated aaa aaa or aa aa by standard poors and moody s rating services at the time of purchase and their ratings have not changed as of december  however  some of the securities remain subject to review for possible downgrade 
any downgrade may result in further declines in the estimated fair value of the securities as a result of the perceived increase in risk associated with an investment in the securities 
in addition to the above mentioned securities  the company holds one commercial paper security issued by a structured investment vehicle that was placed in receivership in september for which an insolvency event was declared by the receiver in october the issuer invests in residential and commercial mortgages and other structured credits including sub prime mortgages 
based on information received from the receiver  we expect a restructuring plan for this security to be implemented by mid this restructuring plan may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments
