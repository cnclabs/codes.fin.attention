overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the aesthetic and therapeutic skin health markets 
we develop and commercialize prescription based  topical skin health systems that enable physicians to treat a range of skin conditions  including pre mature aging  photo damage  skin laxity  hyperpigmentation  acne and soft tissue deficits  such as fine lines and wrinkles 
current products 
our primary product is the obagi nu derm system  which we believe is the only clinically proven  prescription based  topical skin health system on the market that has been shown to enhance the skin s overall health by correcting photo damage at the cellular level  resulting in a reduction of the visible signs of aging 
the primary active ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and otc skin care agents 
in april  we introduced the obagi c rx system consisting of a combination of prescription and otc drugs and adjunctive cosmetic skin care products to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and the oxidative damage of free radicals 
the central ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and vitamin c 
in october  we launched the obagi professional c products  a complete line of proprietary  non prescription products  which consists of vitamin c serums used to reduce the appearance of damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet radiation and other environmental influences 
in july  we launched our obagi condition and enhance system  for use in conjunction with commonly performed cosmetic procedures including botox injections 
in october  we launched our first product in the elastiderm product line  an eye cream for improving the elasticity and skin tone around the eyes 
we introduced the clenziderm md system and a second product in the elastiderm system to address acne and skin elasticity  respectively  based on positive interim clinical results  in february in july  we launched our second system in the clenziderm md line  clenziderm md system ii  that is specifically formulated for normal to dry skin 
in august  we launched two new nu derm condition and enhance systems 
one is designed specifically for use with non surgical procedures while the other has been developed for use with surgical procedures 
we also market tretinoin  used for the topical treatment of acne in the united states  and obagi blue peel products  used to aid the physician in the application of skin peeling actives 
future products 
we focus our research and new product development activities on improving the efficacy of established prescription and otc therapeutic agents by enhancing the penetration of these agents across the skin barrier using our proprietary technologies collectively known as penetrating therapeutics 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce any additional systems using these technologies 
us distribution 
we market all of our products through our direct sales force in the united states primarily to plastic surgeons  dermatologists and other physicians who are focused on aesthetic skin care 
aesthetic skin care 
as of december   we sold our products to over  physician dispensing accounts in the united states  with no single customer accounting for more than of our net sales 
our current products are not eligible for reimbursement by medicare or other third party payors 
we generated us net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
international distribution 
we market our products internationally through international distribution partners that have sales and marketing activities in countries outside of the united states 
much like our business model in the united states  these distributors sell our products through direct sales representatives to physicians  or through alternative distribution channels depending on regulatory requirements and industry practices 
we generated international net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
licensing 
we market our products in the japanese retail markets through a trademark and know how license agreement with rohto 
under our agreement  rohto is licensed to manufacture and sell a series of otc products under the obagi brand name in the japanese drug store channel  and we receive a royalty based upon sales of obagi branded products in japan by rohto 
rohto s obagi branded products are sold through approximately  high end drug stores 
we have other licensing arrangements in japan to market and sell otc product systems under the obagi brand  both for in office use in facial procedures  as well as for sale as a take home product kit in the spa channel 
we receive royalties based upon these arrangements 
we generated licensing revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales growth 
our total net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our sales growth has been driven primarily by our professional marketing efforts to physicians 
our professional sales force targets physicians who are providing aesthetic treatments and educates them on how to best provide our products to their patients 
our professional sales force also provides education to physicians  aestheticians  other staff and patients about the benefits of promoting skin health 
we have increased our sales force from employees as of january  to employees as of december  we will continue to invest in expanding our sales force as warranted by the success of new product offerings and continued core product growth 
strong growth in the aesthetic skin care market 
in  the global skin care market was estimated to be billion  of which over were facial skin care products  according to global industry analysts  inc  a market research firm 
additionally  the independent research firm  kalorama information  estimates that from to  over million people in the united states will receive cosmetic facial procedures for which they will pay over billion 
we believe this reflects a growing desire and acceptance among the aging population to seek aesthetic facial products and procedures from their physicians 
with our leading position in the physician dispensed channel  the clinically proven aesthetic benefits of our products and the potential of our systems to enhance or complement many other facial procedures  we believe we are well positioned to meet this growing patient demand 
conducting clinical studies on our products 
we have completed clinical studies since to demonstrate the efficacy of our products 
we believe that these clinical studies provide our products added scientific credibility in the physician dispensed market 
we are currently conducting four clinical studies on new and existing products and plan on initiating six additional clinical studies by december  international 
we have formal distribution agreements with distribution partners covering over countries and a trademark and product know how license agreement in the otc market of japan 
currently  those distributors have sales activities in approximately countries  with growth in and coming primarily from the middle east  far east  europe  and north america excluding the united states 
results of operations 
we commenced operations in  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the accumulated deficit arose when we paid a million common stock dividend in february at december   we had accumulated earnings of million 
we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
seasonality 
sales of our products have historically been higher between september and march 
we believe this is due to increased product use and patient compliance during these months 
we believe this increased usage and compliance relates to several factors such as higher patient tendencies toward daily compliance inversely proportionate to their tendency to travel and or engage in other disruptive activities during summer months 
patient travel and other disruptive activities that affect compliance are at their peak during july and august 
economy 
many treatments in which our products are used are considered cosmetic in nature  are typically paid for by the patient out of disposable income and are not subject to reimbursement by third party payers such as health insurance organizations 
as a result  we believe that our future sales growth may to some extent be influenced by the economic conditions within the geographic markets we sell our products 
historically  we have not been able to quantify with any degree of certitude the impact  if any  economic conditions have had on our sales 
we believe  however  that the aesthetic nature of our products  the desire to maintain a healthy and youthful appearance and the demographics of the patients that use our products should limit the negative impact on our sales assuming any such economic downturn is not severe 
future growth 
we believe that our future growth will be driven by increased direct sales coverage  ongoing marketing efforts to create increased awareness of the obagi brand and the benefits of skin health and new product offerings 
we plan to continue to invest significant resources on the commercialization of new applications of our current products  the continuing development of our pipeline products and the in licensing or acquisition of new product opportunities 
our on going profitability is primarily dependent upon the continued success of our current product offerings 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  sales and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales return reserve  accounts receivable  inventory and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
by their nature  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point as outlined in our sales agreements 
our domestic sales agreements do not provide for rights of return or price protection 
however  we may approve returns on a case by case basis at our discretion 
certain international distribution agreements do provide for rights of return and price protection 
generally  such return rights are for a period of not more than days after the products have been shipped to the distributors 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we continuously monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
we do not grant any warranty provisions on our products 
we provide for discounts and allowances based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction to revenue 
to date such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
other than our provision for future returns  the only estimates that we have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectability of the resulting receivable  both of which are discussed below 
we grant price protection rights to certain international distributors 
such price protection rights require us to pay the distributor if there is a reduction in the list price of our products 
price protection payments would be required for the distributor s inventory on hand or in transit on the date of the price reduction  for a period not to exceed days prior to the date of the price reduction 
we have not recorded a liability in connection with such price protection rights as we have never reduced the list prices of our products 
in september  we entered into a licensing agreement with rohto see note to our financial statements  a large japan based company that specializes in the distribution and marketing of otc medical oriented products in the drug store and retail channels 
in january  we entered into a licensing agreement with tokyo beauty center see note  a diversified japanese consumer products and services company  which also owns and operates a large chain of aesthetic spas in japan 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is based upon a predetermined rate within the respective licensing agreement 
sales returns and allowances 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue recognized from such sales by an estimate of future product returns and other sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates and sales incentives relating to products sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales returns include the historical rate of returns and current market conditions 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period after shipment of the product has occurred 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales allowances include quality of product and recent promotional activity 
if actual future experience for product returns and other sales allowances exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
receivables are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible  taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer and the value of any collateral 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and this exceeds our estimates of the balance sheet date  we would need to charge additional receivables to our allowances  and our financial position  results of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed at actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology  new product offerings and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
to date  actual reserve requirements approximated management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the use of a nonamortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and intangibles having an indefinite life are not amortized  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually or if an event occurs or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate an impairment include a significant change in the business climate  economic and industry trends  legal factors  negative operating performance indicators  significant competition  changes in our strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to such reporting units  assignment of goodwill to such reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we have selected september as the date on which we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
based on our analyses  no impairment charges were recognized for the years ended december   and other intangible assets consist of trademarks  distribution rights  covenants not to compete  patents  customer lists  and proprietary formulations 
other intangible assets are amortized over the expected period of benefit using the straight line method over the following lives trademarks years  distribution rights ten years  covenants not to compete seven years  and other intangible assets three to years 
any unfavorable changes in market conditions or our product lines may result in the impairment of goodwill or an intangible asset  which could adversely impact our net income 
leases 
we account for leases under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as either operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
minimum base rents for our operating leases  which generally have scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease  are recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the initial lease term includes the period from when we are given access and control over the lease property  whether or not rent payments are due under the terms of the lease 
for leases with renewal periods at our option  we generally consider the lease term to consist of the initial lease term  as exercise of the renewal options as determined at lease inception are not considered to be reasonably assured of exercise 
however  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty of sufficient magnitude to us  then the renewal  at inception  is reasonably assured and will be included in the determination of the appropriate lease term 
in certain instances  we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to renovate leased premises 
if costs are paid directly by the landlord or reimbursed to us by the landlord  we record a deferred rent liability and amortize the deferred rent liability over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
in other instances  we may expend cash for landlord additions that we make to lease premises that are reimbursed to us by the landlord 
based on the specifics of the leased space and the lease agreement  during the renovation period  amounts paid will be recorded as prepaid rent and any landlord reimbursement will be recorded as an offset to prepaid rent 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in connection with our january adoption of sfas no 
r  we adopted the modified prospective transition method in the first quarter of fiscal  and as a result  did not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation is recognized for i expense related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted during the one year period preceding our initial public offering  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii expense related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with sab no 
 the remaining unvested options we issued prior to the one year period preceding our initial public offering  with the exception of the october grants  are not included in the sfas no 
r option pool as they were valued using the minimum value method 
as a result  unless subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled  such unvested options will not be included in stock based compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
we estimated our options expected terms in accordance with sab no 
and sab no 
 using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for stock based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected terms result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  the impact to our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  on income before income taxes and net income was  and  and did not have a material effect on basic and diluted earnings per share  respectively 
for the year ended december   the impact on income before income taxes and net income was  and  and had a and a impact on basic and dilutive earnings per share  respectively 
in addition  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented the tax benefit resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  the excess tax benefits for those options are classified as financing cash inflows 
prior to our common stock being actively traded  our board of directors  the members of which we believe have extensive business  finance and investment experience  were required to estimate the fair value of our common stock at the time of each option grant for purposes of determining stock based compensation expense for the periods presented herein 
in response to that requirement  our board of directors appointed members of the compensation committee to analyze our stock value and recommend common stock valuation estimates 
for economic reasons  we initially chose to value our options using a model that employed a market based approach based principally upon applying appropriate valuation multiples to the ebitda and revenue and not to obtain a contemporaneous valuation by an independent third party 
as a privately held company  we believed that the members of our compensation committee had the requisite experience and expertise to determine the fair value of the options 
if a valuation model using different input variables and assumptions had been used  our common stock valuation may have been different 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense  net income and net income per share amounts could have been materially different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  to determine the fair market value of our common stock 
uncertainty in income taxes 
effective january   we began to measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with fin fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the expanded disclosure requirements of fin are presented in note to the consolidated condensed financial statements in part i  item i 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
prior to january   we recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognized approximately a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
results of operations the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the year ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category skin health nu derm   vitamin c   skin laxity   therapeutic  other   total   licensing fees   total net sales   united states international net sales increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we experienced nu derm sales growth of million 
in addition  we saw sales growth of million and million in the vitamin c and other categories  respectively 
the two product categories formally launched in  skin laxity and therapeutic  increased million and million  respectively 
licensing fees increased million during the year ended december  our sales growth was comprised of million of growth in the united states and million in growth from international markets 
us growth was fueled by the overall growth in the skin care market  the recent launch of two new product lines and the expansion of our sales force 
over of the product category sales growth experienced was attributable to unit volume growth 
the nu derm product category growth was largely driven by the expansion of our sales force  the promotional and educational efforts of our professional sales force and the launch of nu derm condition and enhance for botox in july and the launch of two condition and enhance systems in august  which on a combined basis contributed million 
the growth in the vitamin c category was primarily driven by the strong sales performance by the obagi c rx product line 
the skin laxity product category growth was due to a full year of sales of our elastiderm eye cream product during the year ended december  as compared to only months during the year ended december  and the february launch of the second product in the category  elastiderm eye gel 
the therapeutic product category growth is attributable to the official launch of our clenziderm product line in february and the launch of the second clenziderm system in july the other product category growth was driven by the continued success of our system approach concept launched in early the system approach is designed to educate physicians on the benefits of prescribing the complete nu derm system as opposed to partial systems 
international sales growth was primarily in the skin laxity  vitamin c and therapeutic product lines and primarily came from four regions  million from the europe and other region  million from north america excluding the united states  million from the middle east  and million from the far east 
our licensing fees increased million primarily due to fees received under our agreement with rohto 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of i the million increase in therapeutic sales  which solely consist of our clenziderm product line that has a lower gross margin compared to our other product line offerings  ii start up manufacturing costs for the bpo serum gel burden on the initial units produced and sold  and iii a decline in our vitamin c margin due to a reserve for obsolete inventories arising from product reformulation of approximately million 
this was partially offset by improved margins on products in our other product line due to new contract volume purchasing discounts with the manufacturer 
although we anticipate gaining efficiency in our manufacturing processes for clenziderm  we believe our margins will remain slightly lower in the near future as we ramp up the sales volume of our clenziderm product line 
cost of sales also consists of outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  advertising  travel expense and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following i a million increase due to the hiring of additional employees  largely direct sales and administrative support personnel  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   ii a million increase in expenses for physician training  practice building and patient acquisition  iii million increase primarily consisting of market research targeting physicians and patients and for product development  iv a million increase in non cash compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   v a million increase due to expenses related to the secondary offering completed in october  vi a million increase in insurance  vii a million increase in volume driven activities  viii a million increase in operational and manufacturing support activities  ix a million increase in depreciation and amortization  and x a million increase in advertising costs  offset by  i a million decrease in expenses relating to operating as a public company  ii a million decrease in management fees  and iii a million decrease in professional fees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  we expect to incur additional operating costs  such as professional fees and insurance costs  related to the growth of our business 
however  we believe selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a one time payment of million to dr 
zein obagi  or dr 
obagi  one of our principal stockholders and one of our former officers and directors  under a non compete agreement during the year ended december  there were no such payments made in as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest expense was million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributable to the prepayment of million in debt with the net cash proceeds received in our initial public offering completed in december during the year ended december  we made million in prepayments  million of which came from the net proceeds received in our secondary public offering completed in october  in addition to our regularly scheduled payments of million and an excess cash payment of million 
the additional prepayments resulted in a complete paydown of our outstanding debt 
interest income increased  to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  income taxes 
income tax expense increased million to million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the decrease in the tax benefit  as a percentage of net income  derived from the research and development credit and certain costs incurred during the secondary offering completed in october not being deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december  the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the year ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category skin health nu derm   vitamin c   skin laxity  therapeutic other   total   licensing fees   total net sales   united states international net sales increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we experienced nu derm sales growth of million  which was largely driven by the launch of our nu derm condition and enhance system for botox in july in addition  we saw a combined sales growth of million in the vitamin c and other product categories  new sales of million from the launch of the our elastiderm product within the skin laxity product category  million of growth in licensing fees and million from the soft launch of the clenziderm product line in october  within the therapeutic product category 
this sales growth was comprised of million of growth in the united states and million in growth from international markets 
us growth was fueled by the overall growth in the skin care market 
over of the product category sales growth experienced was attributable to unit volume growth 
the nu derm product category growth was largely driven by the expansion of our sales force  the promotional and educational efforts of our professional sales force and the launch of nu derm condition and enhance for botox  which contributed million 
the growth in the vitamin c category was primarily due to the successful launch of a new vitamin c line during and early  and a strong sales performance by the obagi c rx 
the skin laxity product category growth was driven by the launch of the first product within the elastiderm product line in the latter half of october the other product category growth was driven by the launch of a new product and a system approach concept launched in early the system approach is designed to educate physicians on the benefits of prescribing the complete nu derm system as opposed to partial systems 
international sales growth was primarily in the nu derm product line and primarily came from four regions  million from the middle east  million from north america excluding the united states  million from the far east  and million from the europe and other region 
our licensing fees increased million primarily due to fees received under our agreement with tokyo beauty centers group  inc gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage increased to  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of i the million increase in vitamin c sales  which have an improved gross margin over the prior year  and ii improved margins on products in our other product line due to new contract volume purchasing discounts with the manufacturer 
we launched a new vitamin c line in october and january to replace third party produced vitamin c with our own branded product  which has significantly higher margins 
the nu derm product line gross margin percentage for the year ended december  declined slightly when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in practice building initiatives 
during the introduction of the first product in the elastiderm product line  the company used pricing promotions as part of its launch strategy to drive elastiderm into its existing customer base 
these pricing promotions slightly reduced overall margins 
our cost of sales includes the cost of our finished goods  which includes product and packaging materials purchased from third party vendors and bulk and fill purchased from independent manufacturers 
cost of sales also consists of outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  advertising  travel expense and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following i a million increase due to the hiring of additional employees  largely direct sales and administrative support personnel  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   ii a million increase in marketing and sales expenses related to our acne and elasticity product lines  iii a million increase in market research and promotion activity aimed towards targeting physicians and patients  iv a million increase in expenses related to our initial public offering  v a million increase in depreciation and amortization  vi a million increase in legal fees  vii a million increase in new indication sales research and promotions  and viii a million increase in non cash compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   offset by a million decline in advertising costs 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  we expect to incur additional operating costs  such as professional fees and insurance costs  related to the growth of our business and our operations as a public company 
however  we believe selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following i a million increase in development costs related to our acne and elasticity product lines and future product pipeline development  ii a one time payment of million to dr 
zein obagi  or dr 
obagi  one of our principal stockholders and one of our former officers and directors  under a non compete agreement  and iii a million increase due to the employment of additional employees during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   offset by a million decline in research and development expenses related to our existing products 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest expense was million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is due to the write down in debt issuance costs resulting from a prepayment of million in debt with the net cash proceeds received in our initial public offering 
the remaining increase is due to the fact that we only recorded eleven months of interest for the facility for the year ended december   as we obtained a million credit agreement on january   compared to twelve months of interest being recorded for the year ended december  interest income decreased  to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decline in our average cash balance to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate declined to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decline is primarily due to the impact of the research and development credit recorded during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  funds required for acquisitions  adequate credit facilities  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in large money market funds consisting of debt instruments of the us government  its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements and through private and public sales of common stock 
we had million available on our revolving line of credit as of december  and december  in december  pursuant to the third amendment of our credit facility entered into in november  we made a prepayment of million on the outstanding balance of the term loans with our net proceeds received from the completion of our initial public offering on december  during the year ended december   we also made a mandatory million excess cash payment  million in principal payments and million in optional principal repayments 
approximately million of the net proceeds generated from our secondary public offering on october  was utilized to pay down our outstanding balance of our term loans and our revolving line of credit 
as of december   we had completely paid down the outstanding debt under the facility 
borrowings under the facility are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and minimum ebitda levels and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
under the terms of the facility  if stonington ceases to own at least of our outstanding common stock  it would be considered an event of default 
certain covenants also limit annual capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants as of december  and on may   we entered into a settlement and consent agreement and mutual release  or the agreement  with the estate of austin t 
mcnamara  the former chairman of our board of directors  president and chief executive officer  the mcnamara family irrevocable trust dated december   the mcnamara family trust dated december  or collectively  the trusts  lucy b 
mcnamara  individually and as trustee of the trusts and as executor of the estate of austin t 
mcnamara  and lighthouse venture group  llc  a limited liability company that was controlled by mr 
mcnamara or collectively  the mcnamara parties 
pursuant to the agreement  we and the mcnamara parties have released each other from all claims we may have against each other  except for claims related to potential taxes and related charges  should they arise  with respect to the past exercise of certain stock options by the trusts 
no payments were made by the parties to each other in connection with the settlement of the claims 
the settlement includes the release of claims by the mcnamara parties that we were obligated to purchase the  shares of our common stock owned by the trusts and all claims related to mr 
mcnamara s employment with us and the termination of his employment 
in connection with the release  we have written off a net receivable of approximately million for a claimed compensation overpayment to a mcnamara party 
the mcnamara parties also sold all of their obagi stock held at the time of the settlement to an institutional investor in a privately negotiated transaction 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million and million  respectively  which includes a current deferred tax asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively  related primarily to the future benefit of our net operating losses for tax purposes 
we anticipate our selling and marketing expenses to increase as we seek to i expand our professional sales force  ii increase our efforts towards physician training and patient awareness  iii support the launch of new products or expanded application of existing products  and iv expand our distribution to new physician specialties 
we anticipate that our administrative expenses will increase to support our current growth plans and compliance with our obligations as a public company 
our research and development expenses will likely increase as a result of our current plans to i research and develop new products and ii expand the application of current products 
we believe that our cash outflows related to acquiring products and entering into licensing agreements may increase as we seek to expand our product portfolio 
additionally  if sales of our current products continue to increase and or we increase the number of products in our portfolio  we may find it necessary to consider alternative manufacturing relationships  which may include the acquisition of our own manufacturing facilities or additional capital expenditures for facilities and equipment of third party manufacturers that are dedicated to our products 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for therapeutic systems or products and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products or technologies and our own development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances may be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
on november   our board of directors approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws in preparation for our initial public offering 
this amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by the stockholders on november  and was filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware in december the changes included i increasing our total authorized shares to   common and  preferred  ii modifying the classes  term and number of the members of the board of directors  and iii implementing other changes deemed necessary for a public reporting company 
we also revised our compensation committee and nominating committee charters and adopted new policies to follow current best practices for public companies 
we have maintained a positive operating cash flow in each year since  and we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities and existing cash and equivalents will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our expected working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states and were denominated in japanese yen 
none of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies

 which causes noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries to be included in the equity section of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of this standard beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas no

eitf  accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf provides guidance on whether non refundable advance payments for goods that will be used or services that will be performed in future research and development activities should be accounted for as research and development costs or deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been rendered 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of eitf will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no

sfas no 
also applies to eligible items existing at november  or early adoption date 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf fsp eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements  which specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
adoption of fsp eitf is required for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fsp eitf as of january  did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued in february which defers the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and the measurement of tax benefits recognized 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
in february  the eitf issued eitf no 
eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf requires disclosures surrounding a company s accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf no 
if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
eitf is effective for the first annual or interim reporting period beginning after december  the disclosures are required for annual and interim financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented 
we began applying the provisions of eitf as of january  as we present such taxes on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities and investment grade marketable debt securities of financial institutions and corporations 
except for the interest rate cap required by our credit agreement  we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the us we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us prime rate and libor interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us libor interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
if the interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest income would increase or decrease by approximately million 
we purchased a libor interest rate cap agreement as an economic hedge against our credit agreement borrowings 
the interest rate cap is on a decreasing notional amount starting at million decreasing to approximately million 
this agreement expires on january  we reflected the cap on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair market value and any change in fair value is reported in interest expense 
as we paid the remaining balance of our credit agreement borrowings upon the consummation of our secondary offering completed on october   the fair value of the interest rate cap was as of december
