item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory we estimate the carrying value of our inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must estimate our income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   an increase of  over the december  level 
during  our continuing operations provided cash of  investing activities used cash of  financing activities provided cash of  and discontinued operations used cash of  cash provided from continuing operations amounted to  in compared to  in operating cash flows during resulted from net earnings of  increased by net adjustments of  for the non cash effects of depreciation  deferred income taxes  stock compensation expense and stock option income tax benefits and decreased by  due to an increase in components of working capital 
the increase of  in accounts receivable over the amount was mainly due to an increase in the days sales outstanding and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in the current year s fourth quarter sales over the comparable period 
the days sales outstanding amounted to days at december  compared to days at december  the inventory increase of  is mainly due to a combination of the lead times for certain raw material items and the necessary inventory to support the current level of shipments and backlog and to meet customer delivery requirements 
capital expenditures amounted to  in our budget for capital expenditures is approximately  we believe that based on our current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations  our resources are sufficient to meet our financial needs and to fund our capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus our net sales increased  or over this sales increase is mainly attributable to a  or sales increase in our high precision product line as unit sales increased over the level 
we continue to pursue sales of these more value added  higher performance and higher average selling price products 
sales in our transducer product line increased approximately over the amount and sales in our standard and high reliability oscillator product lines remained flat with the sales increase is mainly attributable to a combination of the higher backlog at the beginning of versus and the increased bookings in our backlog amounted to  at january  compared to  at january  total bookings for amounted to  versus  in at december   our backlog amounts to  a increase over the december  amount 
we reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in the increase in margin percentage was mainly due to the overall higher percentage of sales from our high precision product line and the favorable effect of spreading the fixed overhead costs over the increased sales volume 
raw material costs as a percentage of overall sales in increased about over period due to changes in product mix 
selling and advertising expenses amounted to  of sales in compared to  of sales in the selling and advertising expenses increase of  or over was mainly due to higher personnel costs  and commission expense to outside sales representatives 
these increases in were partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense  travel and entertainment expenses  and depreciation expense 
general and administrative expenses amounted to  of sales compared to  of sales in the  expense increase over is mainly due to an increase of  in professional fees resulting primarily from our decision to consider possible strategic alternatives to increase shareholder value 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of  in stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses amounted to  of sales compared to  of sales in the  increase results primarily from higher personnel costs 
the increase in interest income over is due to a combination of higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during the current year 
the combined federal and state income tax rate for is compared to in the rate is higher than the rate as the rate received more benefit from the reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes  the reversal of accrued income taxes and the net effect of state nol carryforwards 
we reduced the valuation allowance by  in and  in based on our assessment of the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
as we have state income tax nol carryforwards available  there is no current state income tax provision for and we reported an operating profit of  during compared to an operating profit of  in the current year increase in operating profit over last year results from the increased sales and the corresponding increase in gross profit offset in part by a  increase in operating expenses 
interest income amounted to  in compared to  in we reported a pre tax profit of  from continuing operations in compared to a pre tax profit of  in for  we reported net earnings of  from continuing operations versus net earnings of  in in  we reported an after tax loss of  from discontinued operations 
in total  we reported net earnings of  in versus net earnings of  in results of operations versus net sales increased  or over the sales increase is mainly attributable to higher sales in the buy and resell product line resulting from higher bookings in the year 
the overall actual number of units sold in this product line increased about over  however  the average selling price decreased about 
sales of our domestic products increased slightly over last year as the number of units sold decreased from the level while the overall average selling price increased 
for  total bookings were  or higher than the backlog at december  amounted to  versus  million at december  we continue to see price compression in the buy and resell product line and in our older domestic products and we believe this pricing pressure will continue in the future 
in addition  our near term visibility continues to be poor and we continue to see customer orders for small quantities with near term delivery dates 
we are not sure of the potential impact on its future operations from the current continuing telecom market uncertainties  the industry wide over capacity issues  and the effects of the continuing pricing compression 
we reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in the higher margin was mainly attributable to an decrease in raw material costs due to changes in product mix toward the more value added  high reliability  and higher margin products and product yield improvements 
direct labor as a percentage of sales decreased from mainly as a result of changes in product mix 
overhead costs as a percentage of sales in remained fairly consistent with that in selling and advertising expenses increased  or over this overall expense increase was mainly due to higher personnel expenses of  a  increase in sales commission expense to outside manufacturers representatives  a  increase in travel and entertainment expense  and the recognition of  of stock based compensation expense partially offset by expense reductions of  in advertising  and  in telephone expense 
general and administrative expenses increased  or over mainly as a result of the recognition of  of stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased  or over primarily as a result of increased personnel expenses 
the expense increases are consistent with our plans to make significant engineering investments in new product development in the increase in interest income over is due mainly to higher interest rates during the current year and to a lesser extent higher average cash balances 
the combined federal and state income tax rate for was compared to in the lower rate in is due to a combination of a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes and the reversal of accrued income taxes offset by the effect of the nondeductible stock compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  increase or decrease in interest income 
we purchase certain inventory from and sell product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where we purchase inventory or sell product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to us and the other involved parties
