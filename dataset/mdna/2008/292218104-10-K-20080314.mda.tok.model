our estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years have decreased for past accident years because actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
we refer to such decreases as favorable developments 
the reductions in reserves were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
estimates of net incurred losses and lae are established by management utilizing actuarial indications based upon our historical and industry experience regarding claim emergence and claim payment patterns  and regarding claim cost trends  adjusted for future anticipated changes in claims related and economic trends  as well as regulatory and legislative changes  to establish our best estimate of the losses and lae reserves 
the decrease in the prior year reserves was primarily the result of actual paid losses being less than expected  and revised assumptions used in projection of future losses and lae payments based on more current information about the impact of certain changes  such as legislative changes  which was not available at the time the reserves were originally established 
while we have had favorable developments over the past three years  the magnitude of these developments illustrates the inherent uncertainty in our liability for losses and lae  and we believe that favorable or unfavorable developments of similar magnitude  or greater  could occur in the future 
for a detailed description of the major sources of recent favorable developments  see item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses gross and net  as well as our case and ibnr were as follows

loss development the following tables show changes in the historical loss reserves  on a gross basis and net of reinsurance  for our insurance subsidiaries for the eight years ended december  these tables are presented on a gaap basis 
the paid and reserve data in the following tables is presented on a calendar year basis 
we commenced operations as a non governmental mutual insurance company on january  
table of contents when our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund 
paid and reserve data for the years through has not been included in the following tables because i prior to december   the fund was not required to include reserves related to losses and lae for claims occurring prior to july  in its annual statutory financial statements filed with the nevada division of insurance ndoi consequently  the financial statements made no provision for such liabilities and complete information in respect of those years is not available in a manner that conforms with the information in this table and ii for claims occurring subsequent to july  and prior to the company s inception on january   we believe that the loss development pattern was uniquely attributable to nevada workers compensation reforms adopted in the early s  which pattern is not indicative of development that woul d be expected to be repeated in our prospective operations 
the top line of each table shows the net reserves and the gross reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end 
such amount represents an estimate of unpaid losses and lae occurring in that year as well as future payments on claims occurring in prior years 
the upper portion of these tables net and gross cumulative amounts paid  respectively present the cumulative amounts paid during subsequent years on those losses for which reserves were carried as of each specific year 
the lower portions net reserves re estimated show the re estimated amounts of the previously recorded reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the re estimate changes as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial reserve was carried 
an adjustment to the carrying value of unpaid losses for a prior year will also be reflected in the adjustments for each subsequent year 
for example  an adjustment made in the year will be reflected in the re estimated ultimate net loss for each of the years thereafter 
the gross cumulative redundancy deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the difference between the initial reserve and the latest re estimated reserve amount 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate 
a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate

reinsurance reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies in which an original insurer  or ceding company  remits a portion of its premiums to a reinsurer  or assuming company  as payment for the reinsurer assuming a portion of the risk 
reinsurance agreements may be proportional in nature  under which the assuming company shares proportionally in the premiums and losses of the ceding company 
this arrangement is known as quota share reinsurance 
reinsurance agreements may also be structured so that the assuming company indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount  which is called an attachment level or retention in return for a premium  usually determined as a percentage of the ceding company s primary insurance premiums 
this arrangement is known as excess of loss reinsurance 
excess of loss reinsurance ma y be written in layers  in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount 
any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company 
the ceding company also bears the credit risk of a reinsurers insolvency 
in accordance with general industry practices  we purchase excess of loss reinsurance to protect against the impact of large individual  irregularly occurring losses  and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and terrorism  which would otherwise cause sudden and unpredictable changes in net income and the capital of our insurance subsidiaries 
reinsurance is used principally 
spacer

spacer

spacer

to reduce net liability on individual risks  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
to provide protection for catastrophic losses  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
to stabilize underwriting results and preserve working capital 
excess of loss reinsurance our current reinsurance treaty applies to all loss occurrences during and on policies which are in force between am july  and am july  the treaty consists of two master interests and liabilities agreements  one excess of loss agreement and one catastrophic loss agreement  entered into between eicn and its current and future affiliates and the subscribing reinsurers 
we have the ability to extend the term of the treaty to continue to apply to policies which are in force at the 
table of contents expiration of the treaty generally for a period of months 
we may cancel the treaty upon days written notice  generally  if any reinsurer ceases its underwriting operations  becomes insolvent  is placed in conservation  rehabilitation  liquidation  has a receiver appointed or if any reinsurer is unable to maintain a rating by am best and or standard and poor s of at least a throughout the term of the treaty 
covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the treaty continue to be obligations of the reinsurer  subject to the other conditions in the agreement 
the subscribing reinsurers may terminate the treaty only for our breach of the obligations of the treaty 
we are responsible for the losses if the reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay 
for the treaty  or contract  year beginning july   we have purchased reinsurance up to million 
we would be solely responsible for any losses we suffer above million except those covered by the terrorism insurance program reauthorization act of our loss retention for the treaty year beginning july  is million 
this means we have reinsurance for covered losses we suffer between million and million  subject to an aggregate loss cession limitation in the first layer million in excess of million of million 
additionally  any loss to a single person involving the second through sixth layers of our reinsurance program is limited to million  and the second through sixth layers million in excess of million are limited to one mandatory reinstatement with an additional premium 
the treaty includes certain exclusions for which our reinsurers are not liable for losses  including but not limited to  losses arising from the following war  strikes or civil commotion  nuclear incidents other than incidental or ordinary industrial or educational pursuits or the use  handling or transportation of radioisotopes for medical or industrial use or radium or radium compounds  underground mining except where incidental  oil and gas drilling  refining and manufacturing  manufacturing  storage and transportation of fireworks or other explosive substances or devices  asbestos abatement  manufacturing or distribution  excess policies attaching excess of a self insured retention or a deductible greater than  and commercial airlines personnel 
the reinsurance coverage includes coverage for acts of terrorism other than losses directly or indirectly caused by  contributed to  resulting from  or arising out of or in connection with nuclear  radiolo gical  biological or chemical pollution  contamination or explosion 
we have underwriting guidelines which generally require that insured risks fall within the coverage provided in the reinsurance treaty 
any risks written outside the treaty coverage require the review and approval of our chief underwriting officer and or chief operating officer 
the treaty includes a mandatory commutation a contractual obligation where the reinsurer makes a final payment of the present value of unpaid ultimate losses covered during the treaty period and is relieved from any additional obligations on those losses at months following the expiration or cancellation of the agreement for the reinsurance layer the reinsurance treaty is comprised of a series of insurance coverages by one or more reinsurers that are stacked on top of each other to bring the total reinsurance coverage to a maximum of million to million and commutation by mutual agreement in the layers above million provide for a single reinstatement of the coverage upon exhaustion of the respective layers of coverage 
the significant changes between years from the reinsurance program commencing july  to the reinsurance program commencing july  are as follows

spacer

risks related to catastrophic losses have been reduced by increasing the related reinsurance coverage from million to million  
spacer

spacer

our retention of risk increased from million to million  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer

our coverage for any loss to a single person involving the second through sixth layers of our reinsurance program increased from million to million 

table of contents our practice is to select reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better at treaty inception as indicated in the table below  which provides information about our reinsurers and their participation in our reinsurance program all treaties are per occurrence excess of loss with a term of july  to june

the overall rating of lloyds from a security standpoint is called the market or floor rating 
the existence of this market rating reflects the chain of security and  in particular  the role of the lloyd s central fund which ensures that each syndicate is backed by capital consistent with a financial strength rating of at least that of the lloyds market 
these syndicates are rated under the overall rating of lloyds 
some syndicates have their own separate rating which is higher than the floor rating 
lpt agreement on july   the nevada legislature enacted senate bill sb 
the provisions of sb specifically stated that the fund could take retroactive credit as an asset or a reduction of liability  amounts ceded to reinsured with assuming insurers with security based on discounted reserves for losses related to periods beginning before july   at a rate not to exceed 

table of contents as a result of sb  the fund entered into the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement  in a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers 
the lpt agreement 
the lpt agreement commenced on june  and will remain in effect until all claims for loss and outstanding loss under the covered policies have closed  the agreement is commuted  or terminated  upon the mutual agreement of the parties  or the reinsurer s aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted  whichever occurs earlier 
the lpt agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms 
the lpt agreement substantially reduced the fund s exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
on january   our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  including the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
the lpt agreement  which ceded to the reinsurers substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july   provides coverage for losses up to billion  excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses 
as of december  and  the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million  and billion  respectively 
losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled approximately million and million through december  and  respectively 
the reinsurers agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in june the lpt agreement required the reinsurers to each place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in individual trusts that require that collateral be held at a specified level 
the level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 
if the assets held in trust fall below this threshold  we can require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level 
the value of these assets as of december  and was million and billion  respectively 
one of the reinsurers has collateralized its obligations under the lpt agreement by placing the stock of a publicly held corporation  with a value of million at december   in a trust to secure th e reinsurer s losses of million 
the value of this collateral is therefore subject to fluctuations in the market price of such stock 
the other reinsurers have placed treasury and fixed income securities in trusts to collateralize their losses 
the current reinsurers party to the lpt agreement include ace bermuda insurance limited  xl mid ocean reinsurance company ltd 
and national indemnity company nico 
the contract provides that during the term of the agreement all reinsurers need to maintain a rating of no less than a as determined by am best 
the original reinsurers party to the lpt agreement were ace bermuda insurance limited  xl mid ocean reinsurance company ltd 
and gerling global international reinsurance company ltd 
gerling 
the contract provides that during the term of the agreement all reinsurers need to maintain a rating of no less than a as determined by am best 
on october   the rating of gerling dropped below the mandatory a rating to b 
therefore  on may   eicn entered into an agreement with nico and gerling 
under the terms of this agreement gerling was released from its percentage participation on lpt agreement and nico assumed such participation 
the cost to eicn of the novation was million 
clarendon fronting facility effective july   ecic entered into a fronting facility with clarendon in connection with the fremont transaction  pursuant to which we effectively acted as a reinsurer and provided administrative and claims services 
under the clarendon fronting facility  ecic assumed liability for of the post june  losses under fremont policies in force as of july  and new and renewal policies written through clarendon on and after july  effective july   the agreement was amended such that ecic assumed liability of of the losses on new and renewal policies written through clarendon on and after july  this arrangement was necessary because  at the time of the fremont transaction  ecic did not have a financial strength rating  which is typically required by market 
table of contents participants  such as agents and brokers  and  accordingly  we could not write policies directly in california 
clarendon had such a financial strength rating and  because of the fronting facility  ecic was able to utilize clarendon s rating to write policies indirectly in california 
ecic obtained the relevant financial strength rating in the third quarter of and  as a result  was able to issue new and renewal policies on its own without the fronting facility after that date 
our obligations to clarendon under the fronting facility were initially collateralized with assets placed in a trust 
in october  the trust agreement with clarendon was terminated and the funds were released to us 
recoverability of reinsurance reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the ceding company  or original insurer  to the extent of the reinsurance 
it does not  however  discharge the ceding company from its primary liability to its policyholders in the event the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under such reinsurance 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
we regularly perform internal reviews of the financial strength of our reinsurers 
however  if a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its obligations to our insurance subsidiaries under the reinsurance agreements  our insurance subsidiaries would be responsible for the payment of all claims and claims expenses that we have ceded to such reinsurer 
we do not believe that our insurance subsidiaries are currently exposed to any material credit risk 
in addition to selecting financially strong reinsurers  we continue to monitor and evaluate our reinsurers to minimize our ex posure to credit risks or losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
the company obtains collateral to mitigate the risks related to reinsurance insolvencies 
at december   million was in a trust account for reinsurance related to the lpt agreement and an additional million was collateralized by cash or letter of credit 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions and to our experience with insured losses 
there can be no assurance that our reinsurance agreements can be renewed or replaced prior to expiration upon terms as satisfactory as those currently in effect 
if we were unable to renew or replace our reinsurance agreements

am best s highest financial strength ratings for insurance companies are a and a superior and a and a excellent 

table of contents we review the aging of our reinsurance recoverables on a quarterly basis 
at december   of our reinsurance recoverables on paid losses were days overdue 
inter company reinsurance pooling agreement our insurance subsidiaries are parties to an inter company pooling agreement 
under this agreement  the results of underwriting operations of ecic are transferred to and combined with those of eicn and the combined results are then reapportioned 
the allocations under the pooling agreement are as follows

eicn 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
ecic the pooling percentages are set forth in the inter company pooling agreement and do not change between periods 
the pooling percentages were established july   the effective date of the agreement 
the allocation percentages were based upon the relative amount of unconsolidated company statutory surplus of the respective companies at the time of the agreement 
ecic and eicn rely on the capacity of the entire pool rather than just on their own capital and surplus 
transactions under the pooling agreement are eliminated on consolidation and have no impact on our consolidated gaap financial statements 
investments we derive investment income from our invested assets 
we invest our insurance subsidiaries total statutory surplus and funds to support our loss reserves and our unearned premiums 
as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair market value of the portfolio was billion 
we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and the matching of maturities of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures or other liabilities 
the amounts and types of our investments are governed by statutes and regulations in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and invest excess cash in securities with appropriate duration targets to balance against anticipated future claim payments 
at december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to the latest interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of as compared to as of december  to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of  aa  with approximately of the carrying value of our investment portfolio rated aa or better 
our investment portfolio is comprised of less than of subprime mortgage debt securities or derivative securities relating thereto 
the subprime mortgage crisis was created by a sharp rise in home foreclosures that started in the united states in late as high default rates materialized on subprime and other adjustable rate mortgages arms made to higher risk borrowers 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  changes in market prices of the equity securities we hold in our combined investment portfolio result in increases or decreases in our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
our objective during the past few years has been to reduce equity exposure as a percentage of our total portfolio by increasing our fixed maturity securities 
our investment strategy allows a maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio in equity securities  with our current equity allocation at of the total portfolio at december  
table of contents our equity allocation at september  was above our current selected target of and at the maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio 
we evaluated our portfolio equity allocation during the fourth quarter of and elected to reduce the amount allocated to equity securities to our current target level of during that period 
reducing our equity allocation has the effect of decreasing expected surplus volatility because under statutory accounting principles  equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses charged directly to surplus  in contrast to fixed income securities which are carried at amortized cost with no impact on surplus due to changes in fair value 
equity sales of million related to the portfolio reallocation generated taxable gains of million in the fourth quarter of previous to the sales  these equity securities were recorded on the balance s heet at fair value  with unrealized gains recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of equity 
these sales did not materially increase assets or equity 
our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset and liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints  at the consolidated and individual company level 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors at a detailed level on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning asset management conning as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn  is used in constructing an optimal portfolio 
we regularly monitor our portfolio to preserve principal values whenever possible 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is considered to be other than temporary include length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the security until its expected recovery or maturity 
the following table shows the market values of various categories of invested assets  the percentage of the total market value of our invested assets represented by each category and the tax equivalent yield based on the market value of each category of invested assets as of december

regulation holding company regulation nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory 
table of contents agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
under these laws  the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time  require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of or approval for certain transactions 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation 
pursuant to applicable insurance holding company laws  eicn is required to register with the ndoi  and pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of california  ecic is required to register with the california department of insurance cdoi 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms  charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable  and the insurer s total statutory surplus following any transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
notice to state insurance regulators is required prior to the consummation of certain affiliated and other transactions involving eicn or ecic  and such transactions may be disapproved by the state insurance regulators 
change of control under nevada insurance law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation that became effective on february   for a period of five years following february   no person may acquire or offer to acquire beneficial ownership of five percent or more of any class of our voting securities without the prior approval by the nevada commissioner of insurance nevada commissioner of an application for acquisition 
under nevada insurance law  the nevada commissioner may not approve an application for such acquisition unless the commissioner finds that a the acquisition will not frustrate the plan of conversion as approved by our members and the commissioner  b the board of directors of eicn has approved the acquisition or extraordinary circumstances not contemplated in the plan of conversion have arisen which would warrant approval of the acquisition  and c the acquisition is consistent with the purpose of relevant nevada ins urance statutes to permit conversions on terms and conditions that are fair and equitable to the members eligible to receive consideration 
accordingly  as a practical matter  any person seeking to acquire us within five years after february  may only do so with the approval of our board of directors 
on december   the nevada commissioner approved our application to waive any beneficial ownership over if the excess was caused by the stock repurchase program 
in addition  the insurance laws of nevada and california generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
insurance laws in many states in which we are licensed contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioner of a change in control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
the insurance laws of nevada and california generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
in addition  many other state insurance laws require prior notification to the insurance departme nt of those states of a change of control of a non domiciliary insurance company licensed to transact insurance in that state 
because we have an insurance subsidiary domiciled in nevada and another insurance subsidiary domiciled in california and licensed in numerous other states  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control of us would generally require the party seeking to acquire control to obtain the prior approval of the nevada commissioner and the california commissioner  and may require pre notification of the change of control in those states that have adopted pre notification provisions upon a change of control 
state insurance regulation insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business 
eicn 
table of contents is required to register with the ndoi  and ecic is required to register with the cdoi 
these state agencies have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  including among other things  the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business  license agencies  set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  determine the nature of  and limitations on  investments and dividends  approve policy forms and rates in some states  periodically examine financial statements  determine the form and content of required financial statements  and periodically examine market conduct 
detailed annual and quarterly financial statements and other reports are required to be filed with the insurance regulator in all states in which we are licensed to transact business 
the financial statements of eicn and ecic are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which it is licensed to do business 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market 
for example  states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets 
changes in individual state regulation of workers compensation may create a greater or lesser demand for some or all of our products and services  or require us to develop new or modified services in order to meet the needs of the marketplace and to compete effectively in that marketplace 
in addition  many states limit the maximum amount of dividends and other payments that may be paid in any year by insurance companies to their stockholders and affiliates 
this may limit the amount of distributions that may be made by our insurance subsidiaries 
as an insurance holding company  we  as well as our insurance company subsidiaries eicn and ecic  are subject to regulation by the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business 
eicn is domiciled in nevada and transacts business in nevada 
ecic is domiciled in california and transacts business in arizona  california  colorado  florida  illinois  idaho  montana  nevada  oregon  texas and utah 
additionally  ecic currently holds certificates of authority to write workers compensation insurance in georgia  maryland  massachusetts  new mexico  new york  and pennsylvania 
we are subject to periodic examinations by state insurance departments in the states in which we operate 
the cdoi and the ndoi generally examine each of their respective domiciliary insurance companies on a triennial basis 
we have received notice from nevada and california that they intend to conduct financial examinations of eicn and ecic in premium rate restrictions among other matters  state laws regulate not only the amounts and types of workers compensation benefits that must be paid to injured workers  but in some instances the premium rates that may be charged by us to insure businesses for those liabilities 
for example  in approximately sixteen states  including florida and idaho  workers compensation insurance rates are set by the state insurance regulators and are adjusted periodically 
this style of rate regulation is sometimes referred to as administered pricing 
in some of these states  insurance companies are permitted to file rates that deviate upwards or downwards from the benchmark rates set by the insurance regulators 
in the vast majority of states  workers compensation insurers have more flexibility to offer rates that reflect the risk the insurer is taking based on each employer s profile 
these states are often referred to as loss cost states 
except for idaho  and florida  all of the states in which we currently operate  including california and nevada  are loss cost states 
in loss cost states  the state first approves a set of loss costs that provide for expected loss and  in most cases  lae payments  which are prepared by an insurance rating bureau for example  the wcirb in california and the ncci in nevada 
an insurer then selects a factor  known as a loss cost multiplier  to apply to loss costs to determine its insurance rates 
in these states  regulators permit pricing flexibility 
table of contents primarily through a the selection of the loss cost multiplier  and b schedule rating modifications that allow an insurer to adjust premiums upwards or downwards for specific risk characteristics of the policyholder such as

policyholder management practices 
financial  dividend and investment restrictions state laws require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of surplus and place limits on the amount of premiums a company may write based on the amount of that company s surplus 
these limitations may restrict the rate at which our insurance operations can grow 
state laws also require insurance companies to establish reserves for payments of policyholder liabilities and impose restrictions on the kinds of assets in which insurance companies may invest 
these restrictions may require us to invest in assets more conservatively than we would if we were not subject to state law restrictions and may prevent us from obtaining as high a return on our assets as we might otherwise be able to realize absent the restrictions 
the ability of ehi to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay other expenses will be dependent to a significant extent upon the ability of our nevada domiciled insurance company  eicn  to pay dividends to its immediate holding company  egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
nevada law limits the payment of cash dividends by eicn to egi by providing that payments cannot be made except from available and accumulated surplus money otherwise unrestricted unassigned and derived from realized net operating profits and realized and unrealized capital gains 
a stock dividend may be paid out of any available surplus 
a cash or stock dividend otherwise prohibited by these restrictions  such as a dividend from special assigned surplus  may only be declared and distributed upon the prior approval of the nevada commissioner and are considered extraordinary 
special surplus for eicn is assigned surplus funds relating to statutory accounting for retroactive reinsurance and is not available for dividends without prior approval from the nevada commissioner 
eicn must give the nevada commissioner prior notice of any extraordinary dividends or distributions that it proposes to pay to egi  even when such a dividend or distribution is to be paid out of available and otherwise unrestricted unassigned surplus 
eicn may pay such an extraordinary dividend or distribution if the nevada commissioner either approves or does not disapprove the payment within days after receiving notice of its declaration 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined by statute to include any dividend or distribution of cash or property whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of eicn s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the next preceding december  or b eicn s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the month period ending at the next preceding december as of december   eicn had positive unassigned surplus of million 
as a result of the approval of an extraordinary dividend of million from special surplus by the nevada commissioner on december   dividends from unassigned surplus will also require the approval of the commissioner in at december   eicn had positive unassigned surplus of million 
an extraordinary dividend of million was approved by the nevada commissioner october   which then required and resulted in approval of dividends from unassigned surplus for by the nevada commissioner 
this additional approval was required because combined dividends from special and unassigned surplus for the months exceeded ordinary dividend limitations on the payment of dividends as a percentage of total surplus and also exceeded the net income limitation for all 
table of contents dividends made during the previous months must be considered along with any proposed dividend in the determination of ordinary versus extraordinary dividends when evaluating the limitations set by regulations 
the extraordinary dividend granted on october   by the nevada commissioner of million was conditioned upon the expiration of any underwriter s over allotment option period from the ipo  prior repayment of any expenses of the company and its subsidiaries arising from the conversion and the ipo  the exhaustion of any proceeds retained by the company from the then recently completed initial public offering  maintaining the risk based capital rbc total adjusted capital of eicn above a specified level on the date of declaration and payment of any particular extraordinary dividend after taking into account the effect of such dividend  and maintaining all required filings with the nevada commissioner 
the conditions were met and the million extraordinary dividend was paid 
we used the dividend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders  to repurchase our common stock and for general corporate purposes  other than to incre ase executive compensation 
as the direct owner of ecic  eicn will be the direct recipient of any dividends paid by ecic 
the ability of ecic to pay dividends to eicn is limited by california law  which provides that absent prior approval of the california commissioner  dividends can only be declared from earned surplus 
earned surplus as defined by california law excludes amounts a derived from the net appreciation in the value of assets not yet realized  or b derived from an exchange of assets  unless the assets received are currently realizable in cash 
in addition  california law provides that the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities in the state of california must approve or  within a day notice period  not disapprove any dividend that  together with all other such dividends paid during the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of ecic s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the preceding december  or b of the net income fo r the preceding year 
the maximum pay out that may be made by ecic to eicn on or after december  without prior approval is million 
ecic declared and paid dividends of million in december no dividends were declared or paid in or the cdoi the domiciliary state of ecic has required that in addition to applying the national association of insurance commissioners naic statutory accounting practices  insurance companies must record  under certain circumstances  an additional liability  called an excess statutory reserve 
if the workers compensation losses and loss adjustment expense ratio is less than in each of the three most recent accident years  the difference is recorded as an excess statutory reserve 
in october  the california legislature passed sb which repeals the minimum reserve requirement in regards to workers compensation reserves  effective  january  based on sb  the company did not record an excess statutory reserve as of december  in its annual statement  as filed with the cdoi in the excess statutory reserves previously required by cdoi decreased ecic rsq uo  s statutory basis surplus by million to million at december   as filed with the cdoi 
guaranty fund assessments in nevada  california and in most of the states where our insurance company subsidiaries are licensed to transact business  there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business within each such state participate as member insurers in a guaranty association  which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premium written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
we receive a full or partial credit against premium taxes in some states for amounts paid to guaranty funds 
in california  unpaid workers compensation liabilities from insolvent insurers are the responsibility of the california insurance guarantee association ciga 
we pass ciga assessments on to our policyholders  via a surcharge based upon the estimated annual premium at the policy s inception 
we have received  and expect to continue to receive  these guaranty fund assessments  which are paid to ciga based on the premiums written 
as of december   the company recorded an asset of million for assessments paid to ciga that includes prepaid policy surcharges still to be collected in the future from policyholders 
we also write workers compensation insurance in other states with similar 
table of contents obligations as those in california 
in these states  we are directly responsible for payment of the assessment 
we recorded an estimate of million and million for our expected liability for guaranty fund assessments at december  and  respectively 
the guaranty fund assessments are expected to be paid within two years of recognition 
property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty fund assessments to our insurance company subsidiaries at some future date 
at this time we are unable to determine the impact  if any  such assessments may have on our financial position or results of operations 
we have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings 
privacy regulations in  the united states congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which  among other things  protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information 
subsequently  a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues 
these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions  including insurance and finance companies  and require us to maintain appropriate procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our customers and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our customers 
we may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations  which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition 
a recent naic initiative that impacted the insurance industry in was the adoption in of the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation  which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply w ith the gramm leach bliley act 
in  to further facilitate the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act  the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation 
many states  including california and nevada  have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of customer information 
our insurance subsidiaries have established procedures to comply with the gramm leach bliley related privacy requirements  and we require third parties with whom we do business to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy laws and regulations 
federal and state legislative changes from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry 
among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model laws adopted by the naic 
proposed legislation was introduced in the united states congress during that would allow for an optional federal chartering of us insurance companies  similar to banks 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition or competition among us insurers 
in response to the tightening of supply or unavailability of insurance and reinsurance following the september  terrorist attacks  the terrorism risk insurance act of  or the act  was enacted on november  the principal purpose of the act was to create a role for the federal government in the provision of insurance for losses sustained in connection with foreign terrorism 
prior to the act  insurance except for workers compensation insurance and reinsurance for losses arising out of acts of terrorism were largely unavailable from private insurance and reinsurance companies 
in december  the terrorism risk act was extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra 
while the underlying structure of the act was left intact  the extension includes some adjustments 
the workers compensation laws of the various states generally do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from terrorist acts as well as nuclear  biological and chemical attacks 
in addition  we are not able to limit our losses arising from any one catastrophe or any one claimant 
our reinsurance policies exclude coverage for losses arising out of nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological attacks 
under tripra  federal protection is currently 
table of contents provided to the insurance industry for events  including acts of foreign and domestic terrorism  that result in an industry loss of at least million in through in the event of a qualifying industry loss which must occur out of an act of terrorism certified as such by the secretary of the treasury  each insurance company is responsible for a deductible of of direct earned premiums in the previous year  with the federal government responsible for reimbursing each company for of the insurer s loss in excess of the insurer s proportionate share of the billion industry aggregate limit in any one year 
accordingly  events may not be covered by  or may result in losses exceeding the capacity of our reinsurance protection and any protection offered by the tripra or any subsequent legislation 
therefore  acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we do not believe that the risk of loss to our insurance subsidiaries from acts of terrorism is significant 
small businesses constitute a large portion of our policies  and we do not intend to write large concentrations of business in any particular market location 
however  the impact of any future terrorist acts is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on our insurance subsidiaries  if any  of losses from any future terrorist acts will depend upon their nature  extent  location and timing 
our workers compensation operations are subject to legislative and regulatory actions 
in california  where we have our largest concentration of business  significant workers compensation legislation was enacted twice in recent years 
effective january   legislation became effective which provides for increases in indemnity benefits to injured workers 
benefits were increased by an average of approximately in  approximately in and approximately in iris ratios the insurance regulatory information system iris  is a system established by naic to provide state regulators with an integrated approach to monitor the financial condition of insurers for the purposes of detecting financial distress and preventing insolvency 
iris identifies key financial ratios based on year end data with each ratio identified with a usual range of result 
these ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
as of december   eicn had two ratios outside the usual range and ecic had one ratio outside the usual range as set forth in the following table employers insurance company of nevada

total liabilities include funds withheld by eicn pursuant to an inter company pooling agreement 
insurance regulators will generally begin to investigate  monitor or make inquiries of an insurance company if four or more of the company s ratios fall outside the usual ranges 
although these inquiries can take many forms  regulators may require the insurance company to provide additional written explanation as to the causes of the particular ratios being outside of the usual range  the actions being 
table of contents taken by management to produce results that will be within the usual range in future years and what  if any  actions have been taken by the insurance regulator of the insurers state of domicile 
regulators are not required to take action if an iris ratio is outside of the usual range  but depending upon the nature and scope of the particular insurance company s exception for example  if a particular ratio indicates an insurance company has insufficient capital regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance the company can write or revoke the insurers certificate of authority and may even place the company under supervision 
neither eicn nor ecic is currently subject to any action by any state insurance department with respect to the iris ratios described above 
risk based capital rbc requirement the naic has adopted an rbc formula to be applied to all insurance companies 
rbc is a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
rbc standards are used by state insurance regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions 
nevada and california have adopted laws substantially similar to the naic s rbc laws 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital and surplus to its rbc 

spacer

spacer

spacer 
gif 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance regulator that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its rbc is subject to a trend test 
a trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie  the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds its rbc between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assu mes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year

the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc 
at the regulatory action level  the state insurance regulator will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed

the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc  at which level the state insurance regulator may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control

the mandatory control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its rbc  at which level the state insurance regulator is mandated to place the company under its control 
at december   both eicn and ecic had total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed rbc action level 
statutory accounting and solvency regulations in  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles guidance codification  which  effective january  replaced the previous accounting practices and procedures manual as the naic s primary guidance on statutory accounting applicable to insurance companies in the us statutory accounting is a comprehensive basis of accounting for insurance companies based codification and state laws  regulations and general administrative rules 
statutory accounting principles sap are a basis of accounting developed to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s statutory surplus 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 

table of contents statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted by the nevada regulators and the california regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of eicn and ecic and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds eicn and ecic have available to pay in dividends 
gaap is concerned with a company s solvency  but such principles are also concerned with other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as opposed to sap 
state insurance regulators closely monitor the financial condition of insurance companies reflected in sap financial statements and can impose significant financial and operating restrictions on an insurance company that becomes financially impaired under sap guidelines 
state insurance regulators generally have the power to impose restrictions or conditions on the following kinds of activities of a financially impaired insurance company transfer or disposition of assets  withdrawal of funds from bank account  extension of credit or advancement of loans and investment of funds  as well as disallowance of dividends or other distributions and business acquisitions or combinations 
naic is a group formed by state insurance regulators to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation  reporting and accounting of and by us insurance companies 
although the naic has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business  the naic is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted 
model insurance laws  regulations and guidelines model laws have been promulgated by the naic as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured 
adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the model laws is a requirement for accreditation of state insurance regulatory agencies by the naic 
insurance operations are also subject to various leverage tests  which are evaluated by regulators and private rating agencies 
our premium leverage ratios  also known as our premium to surplus ratios  as of december  and on a statutory combined basis  were and  respectively  on a premiums written basis as compared to for the workers compensation industry in as a whole 
employers occupational health  inc the medical managed care services provided by our subsidiary  eoh  are subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
eoh is authorized in nevada to act as a third party administrator and a utilization review organization and is governed by those laws and regulations as well as those relating to managed care organizations and workers compensation claims administration 
the nature and extent of such regulation generally include methods for approving and denying medical services  quality assurance  medical bill review and payment  network provider management  and financial and other reporting requirements 
eoh s business is dependent upon the validity of  and continued good standing under  the licenses and approvals pursuant to which it operates  as well as compliance with pertinent regulations 
in october  eoh was awarded a workers compensation utilization management accred itation and in november  eoh was also awarded a case management accreditation  both from urac  a washington dc based health care accrediting organization that establishes quality standards for the health care industry

table of contents item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves risks 
in evaluating our company  the risk factors described below should be considered carefully 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and stock price and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business our liability for losses and lae is based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses and expenses 
we must establish and maintain reserves for our estimated losses and lae 
we establish loss reserves in our financial statements that represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured claims that have occurred  including claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
loss reserves are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques and are inherently uncertain 
judgment is required in applying actuarial techniques to determine the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances 
in states other than nevada  we have a short operating history and must rely on a combination of industry experience and our specific experience to establish our best estimate of losses and lae reserves 
the interpretation of historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally legislative changes  medical cost inflation  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
in california  there have been significant legislative changes affecting workers compensation benefits to injured workers and claims administration  and we are observing changes in claim costs and claim payment patterns 
we review our loss reserves each quarter 
we may adjust our reserves based on the results of these reviews and these adjustments could be significant 
if we change our estimates  these changes are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made 
loss reserves are estimates at a given point in time of our ultimate liability for cost of claims and of the cost of managing those claims  and are inherently uncertain 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future claim emergence and payment patterns and estimates of future trends in claim frequency and claim cost 
these estimates assume that the claim emergence and payment patterns  claim inflation and claim frequency trend assumptions implicitly built into estimates will continue into the future 
unexpected changes in claim cost inflation can occur through changes in general inflationary trends  changes in medical technology and procedures  changes in wage levels and general economic conditions and changes in legal theories of compensability of injured workers and their dependents 
furthermore  future costs can be influenced by changes in the workers compensation statutory benefit structure and in benefit administration and delivery 
it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
workers compensation benefits are often paid over a long period of time 
for example  in addition to medical expenses  an injured worker may receive payments for lost income associated with total or partial disability  whether temporary or permanent ie  the disability is expected to continue until normal retirement age or death  whichever comes first 
we may also be required to make payments  often over a period of many years  to surviving spouses and children of workers who are killed on the job or may be required to make relatively small payments on claims that have already been closed which we refer to as reopenings 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occu rrence of the claim and final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
our estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years have decreased for past accident years because actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid 
table of contents losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
we refer to such decreases as favorable developments 
the reductions in reserves were million  million  million  million and million for the years ended december     and  respectively 
estimates of net incurred losses and lae are established by management utilizing actuarial indications based upon our historical and industry experience regarding claim emergence and claim payment patterns  and regarding medical cost inflation and claim cost trends  adjusted for future anticipated changes in claims related and economic trends  as well as regulatory and legislative changes  to establish our best estimate of the losses and lae reserves 
the decrease in the prior year reserves was primarily the result of actual paid losses being less than expected  and revised assumptions used in projection of future losses and lae payments based on more current information about t he impact of certain changes  such as legislative changes  which was not available at the time the reserves were originally established 
while we have had favorable developments over the past five years  the magnitude of these developments illustrates the inherent uncertainty in our liability for losses and lae  and we believe that favorable or unfavorable developments of similar magnitude  or greater  could occur in the future 
state insurance regulations in california and other states where we operate have caused and may continue to cause downward pressure on the premiums we charge 
our pricing decisions need to take into account the workers compensation insurance regulatory regime of each state in which we conduct operations  such as regimes that address the rates that industry participants in that state may or should charge for policies 
in  of our direct premiums written were generated in california 
accordingly  we are particularly affected by regulation in california 
california has recently been through a cycle of substantial rate increases  followed by equally substantial rate decreases 
until  insurance companies were subject to minimum rate regulation in california 
the state had established a minimum rate floor  and workers compensation insurers could not charge rates lower than that floor 
in  california eliminated its minimum rate regulation and allowed open price competition among workers compensation insurers 
one of the results of this was intense pricing competition among insurance companies  with many lowering rates to levels that ultimately resulted in more than insolvencies 
by  rates in california had increased significantly  driven by an expensive benefit delivery system  claims which resulted in higher than normal litigation and a lack of insurance capital within the state 
since  three key pieces of workers compensation regulation reform have been enacted which ref ormed medical determinations of injuries or illness  established medical fee schedules  allowed for the use of medical provider panels  modified benefit levels  changed the proof needed to file claims  and reformed many additional areas of the workers compensation benefits and delivery system 
workers compensation insurers in california responded to these reforms by reducing their rates 
for example  we have reduced our rates in california by since september through december  these reductions in rates in california are in response to the legislative reforms which have reduced claim costs in california 
the passage of any form of rate regulation in california could impair our ability to operate profitably in california  and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  although the california commissioner does not set premium rates  he does adopt and publish advisory pure premium rates which are rates that would cover expected losses but do not contain an element to cover operating expenses or profit 
in november  the california commissioner recommended no overall change in pure premium rates for policies written on or after january  this is the first recommendation of no rate decrease by the california commissioner since the reforms of and based upon our actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss cost trends  we have not filed new rates for new or renewal policies incepting on or after january  in nevada  our rate level increased in as a result of a decision by the nevada insurance commissioner to increase loss costs effective march  by  which we subsequently adopted 
on december   the nevada commissioner announced that the national council on compensation insurance ncci submitted a filing for an average voluntary loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  subsequently on february   the nevada commissioner approved the filing 
according to the nevada commissioner  decreasing claim 
table of contents frequency was cited as the primary driver of the decrease  which more than offsets increasing indemnity and medical costs per claim  the cost of living benefit adjustments that were enacted during the legislative session and the impact of nevada s statutory payroll cap 
our nevada rates continue to be based upon our internal actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss trends 
we have adopted the approved loss costs effective for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  with a revised loss cost modifier  the combination of which we expect will produce an average overall decrease of on our book of business 
we can not determine the effect on our profitability at this time or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in nevada 
certain states have adopted an administered pricing regime  under which rate competition is generally not permitted 
of the states in which we currently operate  only idaho has implemented such regulation 
however  we are exposed to the risk that other states in which we operate will adopt  or that new states which we intend to enter have implemented  administered pricing regimes 
such a regime could prevent us from appropriately pricing our insurance policies in those states  exposing us to the possibility of losses over and above the premiums we are able to collect 
idaho and florida  which we entered in  currently have administered pricing 
due to the existence of rate regulation  and the possibility of adverse changes in such regulations  in the states in which we operate and new states that we enter  we cannot assure you that our premium rates will ultimately be adequate for the purposes of covering the claim payments  losses and lae and company overhead or  in the case of states without administered pricing  that our competitors in such states will not set their premium rates at lower rates 
in such event  we may be unable to compete effectively and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to price our insurance policies appropriately  our business competitiveness  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the premiums we charge are established when coverage is bound 
premiums are based on the particular class of business and our estimates of expected losses and lae and other expenses related to the policies we underwrite 
we analyze many factors when pricing a policy  including the policyholder s prior loss history and industry classification 
inaccurate information regarding a policyholder s past claims experience puts us at risk for mispricing our policies 
for example  when initiating coverage on a policyholder  we must rely on the information provided by the policyholder or the policyholder s previous insurer s to properly estimate future claims expense 
if the claims information is not accurately stated  we may under price our policies by using claims estimates that are too low 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in order to set premium rates accurately  we must utilize an appropriate pricing model which correctly assesses risks based on their individual characteristics and takes into account actual and projected industry characteristics 
our geographic concentration in california and nevada ties our performance to the business  economic  demographic and regulatory conditions in those states 
any deterioration in the conditions in those states could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is concentrated in california  in which we generated of our direct premiums written for the year ended december   and nevada  in which we generated of our direct premiums written for the year ended december  accordingly  unfavorable business  economic  demographic  competitive or regulatory conditions in those states could negatively impact our business 
we focus on select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries 
if the business or economic conditions in either california or nevada deteriorate  the departure or insolvency of a significant number of small businesses from one or both of those states could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in  nevada s economy was impacted by the subprime crisis and its impact on the residential real estate markets 
the subprime mortgage crisis was created by a sharp rise in home foreclosure s that started in the united states in late as high default rates materialized on subprime and other adjustable rate mortgages arms made to higher risk borrowers 
thirteen percent of our business is contracting and  due to the economic slowdown  payrolls 
table of contents of some of our insureds have decreased primarily in the fourth quarter 
as the pool of workers in classes of business declines in those states due to demographic trends  our financial condition and results of operations can be adversely affected 
in addition  many california and nevada businesses are dependent on tourism revenues  which are  in turn  dependent on a robust economy 
any downturn in general economic conditions  either nationally or in one or both of those states  or any other event that causes a deterioration in tourism in either state  could adversely impact small businesses such as restaurants that we have targeted as customers 
we may be exposed to greater risks than those faced by insurance companies that conduct business over a greater geographic area 
for example  our geographic concentration could subject us to pricing pressure as a result of market or regulatory forces 
we have experienced such pressure in california in the past 
for example  our premiums in force per policy in californ ia as of december  have declined by approximately since the same time in  principally as a result of rate changes  see state insurance regulations in california and other states where we operate have caused and may continue to cause downward pressure on the premiums we charge 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such pressure in california  or in any of our markets  in the future 
acts of terrorism and catastrophes could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
under our workers compensation policies and applicable laws in the states in which we operate  we are required to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location and timing of such an act 
we would be particularly adversely affected by a terrorist act in california or nevada  most notably a terrorist act affecting any metropolitan area where our policyholders have a large concentration of workers 
notwithstanding the protection provided by the reinsurance we have purchased and any protection provided by the terrorism risk insurance act of  or its extension  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra  the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated because our excess of loss reinsurance treaty program contains various sub limi ts and exclusions limiting our reinsurers obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism 
excess of loss reinsurance is a form of reinsurance where the reinsurer pays all or a specified percentage of loss caused by a particular occurrence or event in excess of a fixed amount  up to a stipulated limit 
our excess of loss reinsurance treaties do not protect against nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events 
if such an event were to impact one or more of the businesses we insure  we would be entirely responsible for any workers compensation claims arising out of such event  subject to the terms of the terrorism risk act  which has been extended by the tripra as modified in  and could suffer substantial losses as a result 
under the tripra  federal protection is currently provided to the insurance industry for events  including acts of foreign and domestic terrorism  that result in an industry loss of at least million in in the event of qualifying industry lo ss which must occur out of an act of terrorism certified as such by the secretary of the treasury  each insurance company is responsible for a deductible of of direct earned premiums in the previous year  with the federal government responsible for reimbursing each company for of the insurer s loss in excess of the insurer s loss  up to the insurer s proportionate share of the billion industry aggregate limit in any one year 
accordingly  events may not be covered by  or may result in losses exceeding the capacity of  our reinsurance protection and any protection offered by the tripra or any subsequent legislation 
thus  any acts of terrorism could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations also expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes because we may be required to pay benefits to workers who are injured in the workplace as a result of a catastrophe 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  hurricanes  windstorms  hailstorms  severe winter weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and other natural or man made disasters 
to date  we have not experienced catastrophic losses arising from any of these types of events 
any catastrophe occurring in the states in which we operate could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the geographic concentration of our business in nevada and california  known to be particularly prone to earthquakes and fires  subjects us to increased exposure to claims arising out of such a catastrophic event 

table of contents the fact that we write only a single line of insurance may leave us at a competitive disadvantage  and subjects our financial condition and results of operations to the cyclical nature of the workers compensation insurance market 
we face a competitive disadvantage due to the fact that we only offer a single line of insurance 
some of our competitors have additional competitive leverage because of the wide array of insurance products that they offer 
for example  a business may find it more efficient or less expensive to purchase multiple lines of commercial insurance coverage from a single carrier 
because we do not offer a range of insurance products and sell only workers compensation insurance  we may lose potential customers to larger competitors who do offer a selection of insurance products 
the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature  and is characterized by periods of so called soft market conditions in which premium rates are stable or falling  insurance is readily available and insurers profits decline  and by periods of so called hard market conditions  in which rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase 
according to the insurance information institute  since  the property and casualty insurance industry experienced hard market conditions from to  to and to although the financial performance of an individual insurance company is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most workers compensation insurance companies generally tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
because we only offer workers compensation insurance  our fina ncial condition and operations are subject to this cyclical pattern  and we have no ability to change emphasis to another line of insurance 
for example  during a period when there is excess underwriting capacity in the workers compensation market and  therefore  lower profitability  we are unable to shift our focus to another line of insurance which is at a different stage of the insurance cycle and  thus  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the california market in particular is transitioning from a period of capacity shortage to a period of capacity adequacy 
this results in lower rate levels and smaller profit margins 
during the period from to  we believe that rising loss costs  despite declines in the frequency of losses  severely eroded underwriting profitability in the workers compensation insurance industry 
according to the insurance information institute  the workers compensation industry s accident year combined ratios rose from in to a high of in we believe that rising loss costs and low investment returns in recent years have led to poor operating results and have caused some workers compensation insurers to suffer severe capital impairment 
only recently during and in have we seen insurers begin to increase their capacity in order to allow the underwriting of additional premium in california  our largest market 
because this cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors  we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle 
we have experienced significant increased price competition in our target markets since this cyclical pattern has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if our agreements with our principal strategic distribution partners are terminated or we fail to maintain good relationships with them  our revenues may decline materially and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our strategic distribution partners 
we have agreements with two principal strategic distribution partners  adp and wellpoint  to market and service our insurance products through their sales forces and insurance agencies 
for the year ended december   we generated million of base direct premiums written through adp and million of base direct premiums written through wellpoint 
the base direct premiums written for adp and wellpoint were and of total base direct premiums written during  respectively 
our agreement with adp is not exclusive  and adp may terminate the agreement without cause upon days notice 
although our distribution agreements with wellpoint are exclusive  wellpoint may terminate its agreements with us if the rating of our insurance subsidiary ecic were to be downgraded and we are not able to provide coverage through a carrier with an am best financial strength rating of b or better 
wellpoint may also terminate its agreements with us without cause upon days notice 
the termination of any of these agreements  our failure to maintain good relationships with our principal 
table of contents strategic distribution partners or their failure to successfully market our products may materially reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we are unable to replace the principal strategic distribution partners with other distributors that produce comparable premiums 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our principal strategic distribution partners may face financial difficulties  reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services  which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services 
moreover  if either of our principal strategic distribution partners consolidates or aligns itself with another company or changes its products that are currently offered with our workers compensation insurance product  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to adp and wellpoint  as they collect premiums that are due to us for the workers compensation products that are marketed together with their own products 
adp and wellpoint are obligated on a monthly basis to pass on premiums that they collect on our behalf 
any failure to remit such premiums to us or to remit such amounts on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not maintain good relationships with independent insurance agents and brokers  they may sell our competitors products rather than ours  and our revenues or profitability may decline 
we market and sell our insurance products primarily through independent  non exclusive insurance agents and brokers 
these agents and brokers are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors products 
we must offer workers compensation insurance products and services that meet the requirements of these agents and their customers 
we must also provide competitive commissions to these agents and brokers 
our business model depends upon an extensive network of local and regional agents and brokers distributed throughout the states in which we do business 
we need to maintain good relationships with the agents and brokers with which we contract to sell our products 
if we do not  these agents and brokers may sell our competitors products instead of ours or may direct less desirable risks to us  and our revenues or profitability may decline 
in addition  these agents and brokers may find it easier to promote the broad er range of programs of some of our competitors than to promote our single line workers compensation insurance products 
the loss of a number of our independent agents and brokers or the failure of these agents to successfully market our products may reduce our revenues and our profitability if we are unable to replace them with agents and brokers that produce comparable premiums 
if we are unable to execute our strategic plan and successfully enter new states  we may not be able to grow  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
one of our strategies is to enter new states 
for example  we entered illinois in the fourth quarter of and we entered florida and oregon in our lack of experience in these new states means that this strategy is subject to various risks  including risks associated with our ability to

any of these risks  as well as risks that are currently unknown to us  or adverse developments in the regulatory or market conditions in any of the new states that we enter  could cause us to fail to grow and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrade in our financial strength rating could reduce the amount of business we are able to write or result in the termination of our agreements with adp or wellpoint 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims 
our insurance subsidiaries are currently assigned a group letter rating of a excellent  
table of contents with a positive financial outlook  from am best  which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our business 
the a excellent rating is the fourth highest of ratings and is the lowest rating within the category based on modifiers ie  a and a are excellent 
this rating is assigned to companies that  in the opinion of am best  have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards 
am best considers a rated companies to have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
in addition to am best ratings which range from a to d for companies not under supervision or liquidation  companies are assigned a rating outlook that indicates the potential direction of a company rsqu o  s rating for an intermediate period  generally defined as the next to months 
a rating outlook of positive indicates that a company s financial market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level and  if continued  the company has a good possibility of having its rating upgraded 
this rating does not refer to our ability to meet non insurance obligations and is not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by us or to buy  hold or sell our securities 
the financial strength ratings of am best and other rating agencies are subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy  hold or sell securities 
although the policies that we have issued generally do not provide that policyholders may terminate such policies if the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries fall below a certain level  as a practical matter some of our policyholders may conduct businesses that require them to purchase workers compensation insurance from insurers that are rated a or better by am best 
additionally  our insurance agents and brokers may move their business to our competitors if our rating is downgraded 
ther efore  any downgrade in the financial strength rating of our insurance subsidiaries would materially impair our ability to continue to write policies for these policyholders 
we do not know how many of our policyholders have businesses that impose such ratings requirements on the purchase of workers compensation insurance 
our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by our financial strength rating 
our strategic distribution partner  wellpoint  requires that we offer workers compensation coverage through a carrier rated b or better by am best 
we currently offer this coverage through our subsidiary  ecic 
our inability to offer such coverage could cause a reduction in the number of policies we write  would adversely impact our relationships with our strategic distribution partners and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position 
if ecic s rating were downgraded  and we were not able to enter into an agreement to provide coverage through a carrier rated b or better by am best  wellpoint could terminate its distribution agreements with us 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter such an agreement if our rating were downgraded 
the termination of our relationship with either adp or wellpoint would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we are unable to replace them with other distributors that produce comparable premiums 
if we are unable to obtain reinsurance  our ability to write new policies and to renew existing policies would be adversely affected and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
like other insurers  we manage our risk by buying reinsurance 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company  called the ceding company  transfers a portion of insurance risk under policies it has written to another insurance company  called the reinsurer  and pays the reinsurer a portion of the premiums relating to those policies 
conversely  the reinsurer receives or assumes reinsurance from the ceding company 
we currently purchase excess of loss reinsurance 
we purchase reinsurance to cover larger individual losses and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and terrorism 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through july  the program consists of two master interests and liabilities agreements  one excess of loss treaty agreement and one catastrophic loss treaty agreement 
the program provides coverage up to million per loss occurrence  subject to certain exclusions 
our loss retention for the treaty year beginning july   is million 
the coverage is subject to an aggregate loss in the first layer million in excess of our 
table of contents million retention of million and is limited to million for any loss to a single individual involving the second layer through six layers of our reinsurance program 
the second through six layers are limited to one mandatory reinstatement for an additional premium 
we have the ability to extend the term of the reinsurance coverage to continue to apply to policies which are in force at the expiration of the treaty generally for a period of months  but we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will permit such an extension or that we can obtain such an extension on favorable terms 
covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the treaty continue to be obligations of the reinsurer and subject to the other conditions in the agreement 
we are responsible for these losses if the reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay 
the reinsurance coverage includes certain exclusions for which our reinsurers are not liable for losses  including but not limited to  losses arising from the following war  strikes or civil commotion  nuclear incidents other than incidental or ordinary industrial or educational or medical pursuits  underground mining except where incidental  oil and gas drilling  refining and manufacturing  manufacturing  storage and transportation of fireworks or other explosive substances or devices  asbestos abatement  manufacturing or distribution  excess policies attaching excess of a self insured retention or a deductible greater than  and commercial airlines personnel 
the reinsurance coverage includes coverage for acts of terrorism other than losses directly or indirectly caused by  contributed to  resulting from  or arising out of or in connection with nuclear  radiological  biological or chemical pollution  contamination or explosion 
any loss we suffer that is not covered by reinsurance could expose us to substantial losses 
we review and negotiate our reinsurance coverage annually 
our current reinsurance coverage has a total of subscribing reinsurers and  at december   lloyds syndicate sjc and hannover reuckversicherung ag individually reinsured  and  respectively  of the first layer of reinsurance million in excess of the first million in losses 
in addition  lloyds syndicate sjc reinsured of our total reinsurance limit million in excess of the first million in losses 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions and to our loss experience 
we cannot be certain that our reinsurance agreements will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration upon terms satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to renew or replace our reinsurance agreements upon terms satisfactory to us  our net liability on individual risks would increase and we would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses 
if this were to occur  our underwriting results would be subject to greater variability and our underwriting capacity would be reduced 
these consequences could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  and they may also refuse to pay or may delay payment of losses we cede to them 
although we purchase reinsurance to manage our risk and exposure to losses  we continue to have direct obligations under the policies we write 
we remain liable to our policyholders  even if we are unable to recover from our reinsurers what we believe we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts 
reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
for example  we had to replace one of the original reinsurers under the lpt agreement when its am best rating dropped below the mandatory level  see our assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund covered all losses incurred by the fund prior to january   pursuant to legislation passed in the nevada legislature 
we only obtained reinsurance covering the losses incurred prior to july   and we could be liable for all of those losses if the coverage provided by the lpt agreement pro ves inadequate or we fail to collect from the reinsurers party to such transaction 
since we exclusively write workers compensation insurance  with claims that may be paid out over a long period of time  the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled 
recent natural disasters  such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  have caused unprecedented insured property losses  a significant portion of which will be borne by reinsurers 
if a reinsurer is active in both the property and in the workers compensation insurance markets  its ability to perform its obligations in the latter market may be adversely affected by events unrelated to workers compensation insurance losses 

table of contents at december   we carried a total of billion of reinsurance recoverables for paid and unpaid losses and lae 
of the billion in reinsurance recoverable  million was the current recoverable at december  on paid losses and billion was recoverable on unpaid losses and therefore was not currently due at december  with the exception of certain losses assumed from the fund discussed below  these recoverables are unsecured 
the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses will become current as we pay the related claims 
if we are unable to collect on our reinsurance recoverables  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund covered all losses incurred by the fund prior to january   pursuant to legislation passed in the nevada legislature 
we only obtained reinsurance covering the losses incurred prior to july   and we could be liable for all of those losses if the coverage provided by the lpt agreement proves inadequate or we fail to collect from the reinsurers party to such transaction 
on january   our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  including losses incurred by the fund prior to such date 
our nevada insurance subsidiary also assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement that the fund entered into with third party reinsurers with respect to its losses incurred prior to july  the lpt agreement was a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement under which the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
the lpt agreement provides coverage for losses up to billion  excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses  and paid losses under the lpt agreement totaled million through december  accordingly  to the extent that the fund s outstanding losses for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  exceed billion  they will not be covered by the lpt agreement and we will be liable for those losses to that extent 
as of december   the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million 
the reinsurers under the lpt agreement agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in june accordingly  if the nevada legislature were to increase the benefits payable for the pre july  claims  we would be responsible for the increased benefit costs to the extent of the legislative increase 
similarly  if the credit rating of any of the third party reinsurers that are party to the lpt agreement were to fall below a as determined by am best or to become insolvent  we would be responsible for replacing any such reinsurer or would be liable for the claims that otherwise would have been transferred to such reinsurer 
for example  in  the rating of one of the original reinsurers under the lpt agreement  gerling dropped below the mandatory a am best rating to b 
accordingly  we entered into an agreement to replace gerling with nico at a cost to us of million 
we can give no assurance that circumstances requiring us to replace one or more of the current reinsurers under the lpt agreement will not occur in the future  that we will be successful in replacing such reinsurer or reinsurers in such circumstances  or that the cost of such replacement or replacements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the lpt agreement also required the reinsurers to each place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in individual trusts that require that collateral be held at a specified level 
the collateralization level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 
if the assets held in trust fall below this threshold  we can require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level 
the value of these assets at december  was approximately million 
if the value of the collateral in the trusts drops below the required minimum level and the reinsurers are unable to contribute additional assets  we could be responsible for substituting a new reinsurer or paying those claims without the benefit of reinsurance 
one of the reinsurers has collateralized its obligations under the lpt agreement by placing the stock of a publicly held corporation  with a value of million at december   in a trust to secure the reinsurer s obligation of million 
the value of this collateral is subject to fluctuations in the market price of such stock 
the other reinsurers have placed treasury and fixed income securities in trusts to collateralize their obligations 

table of contents for losses incurred by the fund subsequent to june   we are liable for the entire loss  net of reinsurance purchased by the fund 
if the premiums collected by the fund for policies written between july  and december  and the investment income earned on those premiums are inadequate to cover these losses  our reserves may prove inadequate and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell policies at rates we deem adequate 
the market for workers compensation insurance products is highly competitive 
competition in our business is based on many factors  including premiums charged  services provided  financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation  policyholder dividends  perceived financial strength and general experience 
in some cases  our competitors offer lower priced products than we do 
if our competitors offer more competitive premiums  dividends or payment plans  services or commissions to independent agents  brokers and other distributors  we could lose market share or have to reduce our premium rates  which could adversely affect our profitability 
our competitors include other insurance companies  professional employer organizations  third party administrators  self insurance funds and state insurance funds 
our main competitors in each of the ten states in which we currently operate vary from state to state but are usually those companies that offer a full range of services in underwriting  loss control and claims 
we compete on the basis of the services that we offer to our policyholders and on ease of doing business rather than solely on price 
in nevada  our three largest competitors are american international group  inc  builders insurance company and liberty mutual insurance company 
in california  our three largest competitors are the california state compensation insurance fund  american international group and zenith national insurance company 
many of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
some of our competitors  including the california state compensation insurance fund  benefit financially by not being subject to federal income tax 
intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor 
competitors with more surplus than us have the potential to expand in our markets more quickly than we can 
additionally  greater financial resources permit an insurer to gain market share through more competitive pricing  even if that pricing results in reduced underwriting margins or an underwriting loss 
many of our competitors are multi line carriers that can price the workers compensation insurance that they offer at a loss in order to obtain other lines of business at a profit 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and financial condition c ould be materially adversely affected 
our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to realize our investment objectives 
investment income is an important component of our net income 
as of december   our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  had a carrying value of billion 
for the year ended december   we had million of net investment income 
our investment portfolio is managed by an independent asset manager that operates under investment guidelines approved by our board of directors 
although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation  our investments are subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations and market volatility 
general economic conditions may be adversely affected by us involvement in hostilities with other countries and large scale acts of terrorism  or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio and future investment income 
for example  changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on mortgage backed securities included in our investment portfolio 
when interest rates fall  mortgage backed securities are prepaid more quickly than expected and the holder must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  mortgage backed securities are prepaid more slowly  which may require us to receive interest payments that are below the interest rates then prevailing for longer than expected 

table of contents these and other factors affect the capital markets and  consequently  the value of our investment portfolio and our investment income 
any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income and  as a result  decrease our stockholders equity and decrease our surplus 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  administer and make payments on claims  facilitate collections  and  to automatically underwrite and administer the policies we write 
eaccess  our main underwriting and policy administration system  includes the base systems for underwriting evaluation  quoting  rating  policy issuance and servicing  and endorsements 
this system  along with our other systems  enables us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development 
the failure of any of our systems  including due to a natural catastrophe  or the termination of any third party soft ware licenses upon which any of these systems is based  could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business 
as our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
if sustained or repeated  a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner 
any interruption in our ability to write and process new and renewal business  service our customers or pay claims promptly could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
a breach of security with respect to our systems could also jeopardize the confidentiality of non public data related to policyholders  claimants  vendors  or our employees  which could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
we rely on user authentication capabilities and use data encryption  but there can be no guarantee that advances in computer capabilities  new computer viruses  programming or human errors  or other events or developments would not result in a breach of our security measures  misappropriations of our proprietary information or an interruption of business operations 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation that limits the way we can operate our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation by the insurance regulatory agencies in each state in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed  most significantly by the insurance regulators in the states of nevada and california  in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
these state agencies have broad regulatory powers designed primarily to protect policyholders and their employees  not stockholders or other investors 
regulations vary from state to state  but typically address or include

workers compensation insurance is statutorily provided for in all of the states in which we do business 
state laws and regulations provide for the form and content of policy coverage and the rights and benefits that are available to injured workers  their representatives and medical providers 
legislation and regulation also impact our ability to investigate fraud and other abuses of the workers compensation systems where we operate 
our relationships with medical providers are also impacted by legislation and regulation  including penalties for the failure to make timely payments 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation of regulations 
we may be unable to maintain all required approvals or comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations  which are continually undergoing revision and which may be interpreted differently among the jurisdictions in which we conduct business  or to comply with the then current interpretation of such laws and regulations 
in some instances  where there is uncertainty as to applicability  we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry 
these practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities 
we are also subject to regulatory oversight of the timely payment of workers compensation insurance benefits in all the states where we operate 
regulatory authorities may impose monetary fines and penalties if we fail to pay benefits to injured workers and fees to our medical providers in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the naic has developed a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital  known as rbc  which has been adopted by all of the states in which we operate 
this system establishes the minimum amount of capital and surplus calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles necessary for an insurance company to support its overall business operations 
it identifies insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at the inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  including supervision  rehabilitation or liquidation 
the need to maintain our risk based capital levels may prevent us from expanding our business or meeting strategic goals in a timely manner 
failure to maintain our risk based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintai n regulatory authority to conduct our business 
in addition  the naic has developed the insurance regulatory information system iris 
iris was designed to provide state regulators with an integrated approach to monitor the financial condition of insurers for the purposes of detecting financial distress and preventing insolvency 
iris consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review insurers annual statements and financial ratios 
the statistical phase consists of key financial ratios based on year end data that are generated from the naic database annually  each ratio has a usual range of results 
these ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
ratios of an insurance company that fall outside the usual range are generally regarded by insurance regulators as part of an early warning system 
insurance regulators will generally begin to investigate  monitor or make inquiries of an insurance company if four or more of the company s ratios fall outside the usual ranges 
although these inquiries can take many forms  regulators may require the insurance company to provide additional written explanation as to the causes of the particular ratios being outside of the usual range  the actions being taken by management to produce results that will be within the usual range in future years and what  if any  actions have been taken by the insurance regulator of the insurers state of domicile 
regulators are not required to take action if an iris ratio is outside of 
table of contents the usual range  but depending upon the nature and scope of the particular insurance company s exception for example  if a particular ratio indicates an insurance company has insufficient capital regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance the company can write or revoke the insurers certificate of authority and may even place the company under supervision 
as of december   eicn had two ratio outside the usual range and ecic had one ratio outside the usual range  all other ratios for eicn and ecic were within the usual range 
these ratios related to the ratio of liabilities to liquid assets 
eicn and ecic s liabilities to liquid assets ratios were also outside the usual range because total liabilities includes funds withheld pursuant to their inter company pooling agreement  see item business regulation iris ratio 
if either eicn or ecic has unusual results on four or more ratios in the future  they may be su bject to the actions of state regulators discussed above 
this extensive regulation of our business may affect the cost or demand for our products and may limit our ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that we might pursue to increase our profitability 
further  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations or interpretations by regulatory authorities could impact our operations and require us to bear additional costs of compliance 
we are a holding company with no direct operations  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations  and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law 
ehi is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through operating subsidiaries 
its primary assets are the shares of stock of our operating subsidiaries 
the ability of ehi to meet obligations on outstanding debt  to pay stockholder dividends and to make other payments depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds  and  in particular  upon the ability of our nevada domiciled insurance company  eicn  to pay dividends to egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future 
as a result we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries and we may not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock 
nevada law limits the payment of cash dividends by eicn to egi by providing that payments cannot be made except from available and accumulated surplus money otherwise unrestricted unassigned and derived from realized net operating profits and realized and unrealized capital gains 
a stock dividend may be paid out of any available surplus 
a cash or stock dividend otherwise prohibited by these restrictions may only be declared and distributed upon the prior approval of the nevada commissioner and are considered extraordinary 
eicn must give the nevada commissioner prior notice of any extraordinary dividends or distributions that it proposes to pay to egi  company  even when such a dividend or distribution is to be paid out of available and otherwise unrestricted unassigned surplus 
eicn may pay such an extraordinary dividend or distribution if the nevada commissioner either approves or does not disapprove the payment within days after receiving notice of its declaration 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined by statute to include any dividend or distribution of cash or property whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of eicn s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the next preceding december  or b eicn s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the month period ending at the next preceding december nbs p  as of december   eicn had positive unassigned surplus of million 
as a result of the approval of an extraordinary dividend of million from special surplus by the nevada commissioner on december   dividends from unassigned surplus will also require the approval of the commissioner in at december   eicn had positive unassigned surplus of million 
an extraordinary dividend of million was approved by the nevada commissioner october   which then required and resulted in approval of dividends from unassigned surplus for by the 
table of contents nevada commissioner 
this additional approval was required because combined dividends from special and unassigned surplus for the months exceeded ordinary dividend limitations on the payment of dividends as a percentage of total surplus and also exceeded the net income limitation for all dividends made during the previous months must be considered along with any proposed dividend in the determination of ordinary versus extraordinary dividends when evaluating the limitations set by regulations 
as the direct owner of ecic  eicn will be the direct recipient of any dividends paid by ecic 
the ability of ecic to pay dividends to eicn is  in turn  limited by california law  which provides that  absent prior approval of the california commissioner  dividends can only be declared from earned surplus 
earned surplus for proposes of this statute excludes amounts a derived from the net appreciation in the value of assets not yet realized or b derived from an exchange of assets  unless the assets received are currently realizable in cash 
in addition  california law provides that the california commissioner must approve or  within a day notice period  not disapprove any dividend that  together with all other such dividends paid during the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of ecic s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the preceding december  or b of the net income for the preceding year 
the maximum pay out that may be made by ecic to eicn during without prior approval is million 
the cdoi has required that in addition to applying the naic s statutory accounting practices  insurance companies must record  under certain circumstances  an addition liability  called an excess statutory reserve 
if the workers compensation losses and loss adjustment expense ratio is less than in each of the three most recent accident years  the difference is recorded as an excess statutory reserve 
in october  the california legislature passed sb which repealed the minimum reserve requirement in regards to workers compensation reserves  effective  january  based on sb  the company did not record an excess statutory reserve as of december  in its annual statement  as filed with the cdoi in the excess statutory reserves previously required by cdoi decreased ecic s statutory basis surplus by million to million at december   as filed with the cdoi 
our board of directors has authorized the payment of a dividend of per share of our common stock per quarter to our stockholders of record beginning in the second quarter of any determination to pay additional dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our subsidiaries payment of dividends and or other statutorily permissible payments to us  our results of operations and cash flows  our financial position and capital requirements  general business conditions  any legal  tax  regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends including those described above  and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any additional or future dividends 
we have a limited history as a taxpayer  and  as such  we cannot predict whether the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities could assert any tax deficiencies against us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we commenced operations as an insurance company owned by our policyholders  also known as a private mutual insurance company  on january  when eicn assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund 
the fund was not subject to us federal income taxation prior to because it was an agency of the state of nevada 
eicn became subject to us federal income taxation from and after january  although we believe that eicn has properly reported and paid its us federal income taxes in all material respects  we have never been audited by the internal revenue service and  if we were audited  we cannot predict whether the internal revenue service would assert any tax deficiencies that could result in our paying additional taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation  legislative actions and judicial decisions 
the effects of inflation could cause claims costs to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and lae includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatment and litigation costs 
in addition  judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to 
table of contents broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claims payments 
to the extent inflation and these legislative actions and judicial decisions cause claims costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
administrative proceedings or legal actions involving our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our insurance subsidiaries are involved in various administrative proceedings and legal actions in the normal course of their insurance operations 
our subsidiaries have responded to the actions and intend to defend against these claims 
these claims concern issues including eligibility for workers compensation insurance coverage or benefits  the extent of injuries  wage determinations and disability ratings 
adverse decisions in multiple administrative proceedings or legal actions could require us to pay significant amounts in the aggregate or to change the manner in which we administer claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
if we cannot obtain adequate or additional capital on favorable terms  including from writing new business and establishing premium rates and reserve levels sufficient to cover losses  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our future growth or operating plans and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses will generally determine our future capital requirements 
if we have to raise additional capital  equity or debt  financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our stockholders could result 
in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our shares of common stock 
in the case of debt financings  we may be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our future growth or operating plans and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is largely dependent on the efforts of our management because of its industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agents and brokers that sell our products  and the loss of any members of our management team could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our ability to execute on our strategies 
our success will depend in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers  experienced underwriting personnel and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business 
the current success of our business is dependent in significant part on the efforts of douglas dirks  our president and chief executive officer  martin welch  the president and chief operating officer of our insurance subsidiaries  and william yocke  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
many of our regional and local officers are also critical to our operations because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agents and brokers who sell our products 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key executives 
these employment agreements are for a set term of three years and we may terminate the agreements for cause  including but not limited to material breach by the executive  willful violation of any law  rule or regulation by the executive and conviction of the executive for any felony or crime  including moral turpitude 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for those executives 
if we were to lose the services of members of our management team or key regional or local officers  we may be unable to find replacements satisfactory to us and our business 
as a result  our operations may be disrupted and our financial performance may be adversely affected 
assessments by guaranty funds and other assessments may reduce our profitability 
most states have guaranty fund laws under which insurers doing business in the state are required to fund policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurance companies 
generally  assessments are levied by guaranty associations within the state  up to prescribed limits  on all insurers doing business in that state 
table of contents on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by insurers doing business in that state in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
maximum contributions required by law in any one state in which we currently offer insurance vary between and of premiums written 
we recorded an estimate of million and million for our expected liability for guaranty fund assessments at december  and december   respectively 
as of december   all states in which we operate  other than california  had not levied any assessments  therefore  there are no expected recoveries as of december  a guaranty fund payment on deposit balance of million as of december  was recorded as an asset for assessments paid to ciga that includes policy surcharges still to be collected in the future 
the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our premiums written or if we write business in additional states 
in some states  we receive a credit against our premium taxes for guaranty fund assessments 
the effect of these assessments or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
government authorities are continuing to investigate the insurance industry  which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the attorneys general for multiple states and other insurance regulatory authorities have been investigating a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry relating to allegations of improper special payments  price fixing  bid rigging  improper accounting practices and other alleged misconduct  including payments made by insurers to brokers and the practices surrounding the placement of insurance business 
these investigations of the insurance industry in general  whether involving our company specifically or not  together with any legal or regulatory proceedings  related settlements and industry reform or other changes arising there from  may materially adversely affect our business and future prospects 
any such investigation or threatened investigation may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
proposed legislation could impact our operations 
from time to time  there have been various attempts to regulate insurance at the federal level 
currently  the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies 
these areas include securities regulation  privacy and taxation 
in addition  various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed 
these proposals include bills pending before the united states congress that would create a federal insurance regulatory agency  but would allow insurers to choose to be regulated either by such agency or under the applicable existing state regime 
we cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or  if enacted  such laws  could have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk related to our common stock the price of our common stock may decrease  and you may lose all or part of your investment

future sales of shares of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded 
as a result  the trading price of shares of our common stock may decrease and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid to purchase them 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources  including personnel  and cause us to incur additional expenses 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements may continue to strain resources  including personnel  and cause us to incur additional expenses 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of these controls  significant resources and management oversight will continue to be required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns 
changes associated with fully implementing effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may take longer than we anticipate and could still result in potentially significant extra cost 
we expect these new rules and regulations to continue to impact our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly 
we also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to renew director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly those serving on our audit committee 
we will be exposed to risks  including potentially significant expenses and business process changes  relating to evaluations of our internal controls over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act and failure to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or the discovery of material weaknesses in our controls could expose us to material expenses 
as a public company and non accelerated filer  we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act by no later than december  we have completed the initial phase of evaluating our internal control systems and implementing a compliance process 
the ongoing control maintenance program has been introduced 
we are using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso internal control framework to evaluate the effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting 
we cannot be certain  however  as to the timing of the completion of our section evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations  nor can we assure you that our continued processes to comply with section will not result in significant additional expenditures 
compliance with section requires the devotion of time and attention from our management and may require us to secure additional per sonnel 
for example  we anticipate that we will hire additional internal audit  non management compliance and reporting staff over the next year in order to ensure we can meet our testing obligations 
furthermore  upon completion of this process  we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity that remain unremediated 
as a public company  we are required to disclose  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory agencies such as the sec 
in addition  failure to comply with section or the disclosure by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  our access to the capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

table of contents insurance laws of nevada and other applicable states and certain provisions of our charter documents and nevada corporation law could prevent or delay a change of control of us and could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
under nevada insurance law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation that became effective upon completion of the conversion  for a period of five years following february  or  if earlier  until such date as we no longer directly or indirectly own a majority of the outstanding voting stock of eicn  no person may directly or indirectly acquire or offer to acquire in any manner beneficial ownership of five percent or more of any class of our voting securities without the prior approval by the nevada commissioner of an application for acquisition under section a 
of the nevada revised statutes 
under nevada insurance law  the nevada commissioner may not approve an application for such acquisition unless the commissioner finds that a the acquisition will not frustrate the plan of conversion as approved by our members and the commissioner  b the board of directors of eicn has approved the acquisition or extraordinary circumsta nces not contemplated in the plan of conversion have arisen which would warrant approval of the acquisition  and c the acquisition is consistent with the purpose of relevant nevada insurance statutes to permit conversions on terms and conditions that are fair and equitable to the members eligible to receive consideration 
accordingly  as a practical matter  any person seeking to acquire us within five years after february  may only do so with the approval of the board of directors of eicn 
on december   the nevada commissioner approved our application to waive any beneficial ownership over if the excess was caused by the stock repurchase program 
in addition  the insurance laws of nevada and california generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
furthermore  insurance laws in many other states contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioners of those states of a change in control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
while these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change of control  they authorize regulatory action including a possible revocation of our authority to do business in the affected state if particular conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of us may require prior notification in the states that have pre acquisition notification laws 
because we have an insurance subsidiary domiciled in nevada and another insurance subsidiary domiciled in california and licensed in numerous other states  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control of us would generally require the party seeking to acquire control to obtain the prior approval of the nevada commissioner and the california commissioner and may require pre acquisition notification in those states in which we are licensed to conduct business that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
obtaining these approvals may result in a material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
therefore  any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face regulatory obstacles which may delay  deter or prevent an acquisition that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control of us  even if our stockholders might consider such a change in control to be in their best interests 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
in particular  our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws include provisions

for  the pro forma earnings per common share basic is calculated using the net income for the months ended december   as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the weighted average shares outstanding was calculated using those shares available to eligible members in the conversion  or  shares  for the period prior to the ipo  and the actual weighted shares outstanding for the period after the ipo 
earnings per common share diluted is based on the pro forma weighted shares outstanding basic adjusted by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive common shares been issued and reduced by the number of common shares that could have been purchased from the proceeds of the potentially dilutive shares 
the company s outstanding options have been excluded in computing the diluted earnings per share for the pro forma year ended december   because their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
although there were  dilutive potential common shares at december   they did not impact the pro forma earnings per share number as shown 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
for the years and prior  the pro forma earnings per common share basic and diluted is presented to depict the impact of our conversion described above  as prior to the conversion we did not have any outstanding common shares 
the earnings per common share basic and diluted was computed using only the shares of the our common stock issued to eligible members in the conversion  and does not include any shares issued to new investors in connection with the our initial public offering or the impact of the cash elections made by eligible members 
we had no common stock equivalents outstanding for the periods presented prior to that would create a dilutive effect on pro forma earnings per share 

table of contents gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance and the intercompany pooling agreement 
direct premiums written are the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written are premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from any authorized state mandated pools and a previous fronting facility 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
losses and lae ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned 
underwriting and other operating expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expense to net premiums earned 
combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio and the underwriting and other operating expense ratio 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for incurred but unpaid losses and lae  which represented substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
we define net income before impact of lpt agreement as net income less i amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and ii adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
we define pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the lpt agreement as net income before impact of the lpt agreement divided by the common shares issued in our conversion 
these are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
we present pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of performance by outstanding common share issued in our conversion 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe these presentations are useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the item excluded has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to net income before impact of lpt agreement for the periods presented

a any adjustment to the estimated direct reserves ceded under the lpt agreement is reflected in losses and lae for the period during which the adjustment is determined  with a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period 
there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report

total equity including deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial position under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to total equity or any other measure of financial health derived in accordance with gaap

the

total statutory surplus represents the total consolidated surplus of eicn  which includes its wholly owned subsidiary ecic  our insurance subsidiaries  prepared in accordance with the accounting practices of the naic  as adopted by nevada or california  as the case may be 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
net premiums written to total statutory surplus ratio is the ratio of our insurance subsidiaries annual net premiums written to total statutory surplus 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in item and item of this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in item a of this report 
our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including the risks described in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a specialty provider of workers compensation insurance focused on select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries 
workers compensation is a statutory system under which an employer is required to pay for its employees medical  disability and vocational rehabilitation and death benefit costs for work related injuries or illnesses 
our business has historically targeted businesses located in several western states  primarily california and nevada 
during  based on net premiums written  we were the second  eighth and eighteenth largest non governmental writer of workers compensation insurance in nevada  california and the united states  respectively  based on net premiums written  as reported by am best 
we believe we benefit by targeting small businesses  a market that is characterized by fewer competitors  more attractive pricing and strong persistency when compared to the us workers compensation insurance industry in general 
as a result of our disciplined underwriting standards  we believe we are able to price our policies at levels which are competitive and profitable 
our approach to underwriting is therefore consistent with our strategy of not sacrificing profitability and stability for top line revenue growth 
in  we wrote and of our direct premiums written in california and nevada  respectively 
we also write business in nine other states arizona  colorado  florida  idaho  illinois  montana  oregon  texas and utah and are licensed to write business in six additional states georgia  maryland  massachusetts  new mexico  new york  and pennsylvania 
we market and sell our workers compensation insurance products through independent local and regional agents and brokers  and through our strategic distribution partners  including our principal strategic distribution partners  adp  inc adp and wellpoint  inc wellpoint 
in  we wrote million  or  of our gross premiums written through adp and wellpoint 
we entered florida and oregon in we commenced operations as a private domestic mutual insurance company on january  when our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the nevada state industrial insurance system the fund 
the fund had over years of workers compensation experience in nevada 
in july  we acquired the renewal rights to a book of workers compensation insurance business  and certain other tangible and intangible assets  from fremont compensation insurance group and its affiliates fremont  primarily comprising accounts in california and  to a lesser extent  in idaho  montana  utah and colorado 
because of the fremont transaction  we were able to establish our important relationships and distribution agreements with adp and wellpoint 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae  which represented substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  entry into the lpt agreement resulted in an initial deferred reinsurance gain in accordance with gaap  and this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance re coveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and 
table of contents the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
in addition  we receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense  see results of operations 
we operate in a single reportable segment with territorial offices serving the various states in which we are currently doing business 
we currently believe that the workers compensations insurance industry is transitioning to a more competitive market environment 
our strategy across market cycles is to maintain underwriting profitability  manage our expenses and focus on underserved markets within our targeted classes of businesses that we believe will provide greater opportunities for profitable returns 
on january   we announced our acquisition of amcomp incorporated amcomp 
we believe this acquisition will provide significant opportunity to make progress in executing our strategic goals and achieving our vision of being a leader in the property and casualty insurance industry specializing in workers compensation 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the following net premiums earned 
our net premiums earned have historically been generated primarily in california and nevada 
in california  we have reduced our rates by during the period september through december   including a decline of since january  this compares with the california workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb recommendation of a rate decline for the same period 
in november   the california commissioner of insurance california commissioner recommended that there be no overall change in pure premium rates for policies written on or after january  this is the first recommendation of no rate decrease by the california commissioner since the reforms of and our california rates continue to be based upon our actuarial analysis of curren t and anticipated loss cost trends 
we have not filed new rates for new or renewal policies incepting on or after january  in nevada  our rate level increased in as a result of a decision by the nevada commissioner of insurance nevada commissioner to increase loss costs effective march  by  which we subsequently adopted 
on december   the nevada commissioner announced that the national council on compensation insurance ncci submitted a filing for an average voluntary loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  subsequently  on february   the nevada commissioner approved the filing 
according to the nevada commissioner  decreasing claim frequency was cited as the primary driver of the proposed decrease  which more than offset increasing indemnity and medical costs per claim  the cost of living benefit adjustments that were enacted during the legislative session and the impact of the payroll cap 
our nevada rates continue to be based upon our internal actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss trends 
we have adopted the approved loss costs effective for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march   with a revised loss cost modifier  the combinati on of which we expect will produce an average overall decrease of on our book of business 
we cannot determine the effect on our profitability at this time  or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in nevada 
we experienced a decline in the number of policies in force in nevada in  which was the result of adherence to our underwriting guidelines that are designed to minimize the underwriting of classes of business that do not meet our target risk profiles  and due to competitive pressures 
our policy count growth  primarily in california  mitigated some of the decline in premiums we experienced principally due to declining rate levels 
companywide  we expect to see a similar declining total premium trend in  where consistent policy growth will reduce  but not offset the decline in premium written in california and nevada 
it is uncertain how these trends will impact profitability 

table of contents net investment income and realized gains losses on investments 
we invest our statutory surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae in fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
net investment income includes revenue from interest and dividends on invested assets less bank service charges  custodial and portfolio management fees 
realized gains losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original cost equity securities or amortized cost fixed maturity investments 
our net investment income and realized gains and losses on investments are affected by general economic conditions 
when  in the opinion of management  a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost or amortized cost is considered to be other than temporary the investment s cost or amortized cost is written down to its fair value and the amount written down is recorded in earnings as a realized loss on investments 
conning asset management conning  our sole portfolio manager  follows our written investment guidelines based on strategies approved by our board of directors 
our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints 
the fixed maturity securities portion of our portfolio maintains a duration target of a maximum tax exempt capacity of not more than of the total fixed maturity portfolio 
the equity portion of our portfolio has an authorized allocation range of 
the decrease in the equity allocation in the fourth quarter of has had the effect of decreasing surplus volatility because under statutory accounting principles  equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses charged directly to surplus in contrast to fixed income securities which are carried at amortized cost with no impact on surplus due to changes in fa ir value  while increasing the duration target has helped to increase the tax equivalent investment yield from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our tax exempt allocation is supported by our strong operating profitability and tax paying status 
the characteristics and performance of the portfolio are continually monitored and a detailed review is performed on a quarterly basis 
thus  changes in allocation will occur as we observe opportunities in the market 
we anticipate that the strategy will remain focused on conservative fixed income securities 
expenses our expenses consist of the following losses and lae 
losses and lae represent our largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
the quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and lae  which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques 
in states other than nevada  we have a short operating history and must rely on a combination of industry experience and our specific experience to establish our best estimate of losses and lae reserves 
the interpretation of historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally regulatory changes  economic fluctuations and legal trend s 
in recent years  we experienced lower losses and lae in california than we anticipated due to factors such as regulatory reform designed to reduce loss costs in that market and inflation 
the joint marketing of our workers compensation insurance with wellpoint s health insurance products also assists in reducing losses since employees make fewer workers compensation claims because they are insured for non work related illnesses or injuries and thus are less likely to seek treatment for a non work related illness or injury through their employers workers compensation insurance carrier 
commission expense 
commission expense includes commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us  and is net of contingent commission income related to the lpt agreement 
commissions paid to our agents and brokers and fronting fees paid to other insurers are deferred and amortized to commission expense in our statements of income as the premiums generating these commissions and fees are earned 
we pay commissions which we believe are competitive with other workers compensation insurers 
we generally pay between to commission on new and renewal business 
during the last year we began paying a two percentage point increase in our commission rate on select policies 

table of contents underwriting and other operating expense 
underwriting and other operating expense includes the costs to acquire and maintain an insurance policy excluding commissions consisting of premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  producing new or renewal business 
these acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to underwriting and other operating expense in the statement of income as the related premiums are earned 
other underwriting expenses consist of policyholder dividends  changes in estimates of future write offs of premiums receivable  and general administrative expenses such as salaries  rent  office supplies  depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately  and boards  bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals  rating plans and experience data 
our underwriting and other operating expense is a reflection of our operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering our business 
however  the cost savings realized through such efficiencies may be offset  in whole or in part  by the potentially significant costs that we incur in connection with the reporting and internal control requirements to which we are subject under federal securities laws and new york stock exchange listing requirements as a result of becoming a public company 
other operating expenses included a charge of million and million for the one time costs of the conversion from a mutual holding company to a public stock company for and  respectively 
critical accounting policies management believes it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates 
management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for losses and lae  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from reinsurers  recognition of premium revenue  deferred income taxes and the valuation of investments 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are directly liable for losses and lae under the terms of insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries underwrite 
significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
our loss reserves are reflected in our balance sheets under the line item caption unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   our reserve for unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion 
accounting for workers compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and lae  referred to as loss reserves  as of a balance sheet date 
we seek to provide estimates of loss reserves that equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and lae of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid 
management establishes the loss reserve based on its own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions 
our aggregate carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae is a point estimate  which is the sum of our reserves for each accident year in which we have exposure 
this aggregate carried reserve calculated by us represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
maintaining the adequacy of loss reserve estimates is an inherent risk of the workers compensation insurance business 
as described below  workers compensation claims may be paid over a long period of time 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may involve more uncertainty than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the claim amount 
the amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development 
reserve development 
table of contents is unfavorable when payments for losses are made for more than the levels at which they were reserved or when subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered deficient 
reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered redundant 
reserve development  whether due to an increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated losses  is reflected in operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and lae during the accounting period in which the development is recognized 
although claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more  we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money 
the three main components of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are case reserves  incurred but not reported or ibnr reserves  and lae reserves 
case reserves are estimates of future claim payments based upon periodic case by case evaluation and the judgment of our claims adjusting staff  as applied at the individual claim level 
our claims examiners determine these case reserves for reported claims on a claim by claim basis  based on the examiners judgment and experience and on our case reserving practices 
we update and monitor our case reserves frequently as appropriate to reflect current information 
our case reserving practices account for the type of occupation or business  the circumstances surrounding the claim  the nature of the accident and of the resulting injury  the current medical condition and physical capabilities of the injured worker  the expected future course and cost of medical treatment and of the injured worker s disability  the existence of dependents of the injured worker  policy provisions  the statutory benefit provisions applicable to the claim  relevant case law in the state  and potentially other factors and considerations 
ibnr is an actuarial estimate of future claim payments beyond those considered in the case reserve estimates  relating to claims arising from accidents that occurred during a particular time period on or prior to the balance sheet date 
thus  ibnr is the compilation of the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year less amounts that have been paid and case reserves 
ibnr reserves  unlike case reserves  do not apply to a specific claim  but rather apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period 
ibnr primarily provides for costs due to

gif 

spacer 
gif 
additional claim payments on closed claims  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the cost of claims that have not yet been reported to us 
most of our ibnr reserves relate to estimated future claim payments over and above our case reserves on recorded open claims 
for workers compensation  most claims are reported to the employer and to the insurance company relatively quickly  and relatively small amounts are paid on claims that already have been closed which we refer to as reopenings 
consequently  late reporting and reopening of claims are a less significant part of ibnr for our insurance subsidiaries 
lae reserves are our estimate of the diagnostic  legal  administrative and other similar expenses that we will spend in the future managing claims that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
lae reserves are established in the aggregate  rather than on a claim by claim basis 
a portion of our losses and lae obligations are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
we establish our losses and lae reserves both gross and net of ceded reinsurance 
the determination of the amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and lae reserves includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance policies  as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the lpt agreement 
our reinsurance arrangements also include an intercompany pooling arrangement between eicn and ecic  whereby each of them cedes some of its premiums  losses  and lae to the other  but this intercompany pooling arrangement does not affect our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

workers compensation is considered to be a long tail line of insurance  meaning that there can be an extended elapsed period between when a claim occurs when the worker is injured on the job and the final payment and resolution of the claim 
as discussed above  the long tail for workers compensation usually is not caused by a delay in the reporting of the claim 
the vast majority of our workers compensation claims are reported very promptly 
the long tail for workers compensation is caused by the fact that benefits are often paid over a long period of time  and many of the benefit amounts are difficult to determine in advance of their payment 
our obligations with respect to an injured worker may include medical care and disability related payments for the duration of the injured worker s disability  in accordance with state workers comp ensation statutes  all of which payments are considered as part of a single workers compensation claim and are our responsibility if we were providing coverage to the employer on the date of injury 
for example  in addition to medical expenses  an injured worker may receive payments for lost income associated with total or partial disability  whether temporary or permanent ie  the disability is expected to continue until normal retirement age or death  whichever comes first 
we may also be required to make payments  often over a period of many years  to surviving spouses and children of workers who are killed in the course and scope of their employment 
the specific components of injured workers benefits are defined by the laws in each state 
based on historical insurance industry experience countrywide  as reported by am best  approximately ten percent of workers compensation claim dollars are expected to be paid more than ten years after the claim occurred 
while our payout pattern likely will differ from that of the industry  industry experience illustrates the general duration of workers compensation claims 
the duration of the injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical treatment  as well as the lifespan of dependents  are uncertain and are difficult to determine in advance 
we endeavor to minimize this risk by closing claims promptly  to the extent feasible 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
we endeavor to mitigate this risk by purchasing reinsurance that will provide us with financial protection against the impact of very large claims and catastrophes 
font although we update and monitor our case reserves frequently as appropriate to reflect current information  it is very difficult to set precise case reserves for an individual claim due to the inherent uncertainty about the future duration of a specific injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical care for that injured worker  and the other factors described above 
therefore  in addition to establishing case reserves on a claim by claim basis  we  like other workers compensation insurance companies  establish ibnr reserves based on analyses and projections of aggregate claims data 
evaluating data on an aggregate basis eliminates some of the uncertainty associated with an individual claim 
however  considerable uncertainty remains as many claims can be affected simultaneously by changes in environmental conditions such as medical technology  medical costs and medical cost inflation  economic conditions  the legal and regulatory climate  and other factors 
the cost of a group of workers compensation claims is not known with certainty until every one of the claims is ultimately closed 
unpaid lae is also estimated and monitored 
the amount that will be spent managing claims will depend on the duration of the claims  the course of the injured worker s disability and medical treatment  the nature and degree of any disputes relating to our obligations to the claimant  the administrative and 
table of contents legal environment in which issues are addressed and resolved  and the cost of the company personnel and other resources that are used in the management of claims 
therefore  our lae reserves also contribute to the overall uncertainty of our aggregate reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
for the reasons described above  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and lae 
actuarial methodologies are used by workers compensation insurance companies  including us  to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of unpaid losses and lae 
as mentioned above  management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions among other factors in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
judgment is required in the actuarial estimation of unpaid losses and lae 
the judgments include the selection of methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims  the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data  industry data  and other benchmarks  the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations caused by internal or external factors  and the weighting of differing reserve indications that result from alternative methods and assumptions 
the adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves  which are based on estimates  is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business  which we attempt to mitigate through our claims management process and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims 
however  no assurance can be given as to whether the ultimate lia bility will be more or less than our loss reserve estimates 
we have retained an independent actuarial consulting firm consulting actuary to perform a comprehensive study of losses and lae liability on a semi annual basis 
the role of our consulting actuary  as an advisor to management  is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates  as well as a point estimate  of our unpaid losses and lae liability  and to present those results to our actuaries and to management 
for purposes of analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time  we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred accident year or accident quarter  since each such group of claims is at a different stage of progression toward the ultimate resolution and payment of those claims 
the claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims and or claimant benefits 
for our nevada business  where a substantial detailed historical database is available from the fund from which our nevada insurance subsidiary  eicn  assumed assets  liabilities and operations in  these separate groupings of benefit types include death  permanent total disability  permanent partial disability  temporary disability  medical care and vocational rehabilitation 
third party subrogation recoveries are separat ely analyzed and projected 
for other states such as california  where a substantial and detailed history on our book of business is not available  and where industry data is in a generally more aggregated form  the analyses are conducted separately for medical care benefits  and for all disability and death also called indemnity benefits combined 
both the consulting actuary and the internal actuarial staff select and apply a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods to our data 
the methods applied vary somewhat according to the type of claim benefit being analyzed 
the primary methods utilized in recent evaluations are as follows paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
this method is used to evaluate both our nevada business and our other than nevada business 
reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
this method is used to evaluate our other than nevada business 

table of contents paid development method 
a method using historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and which develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
this method is used to evaluate both our nevada business and our other than nevada business 
for our nevada business  an additional variant of this method is used that involves adjusting historical data for inflation to a common cost level  and projecting future loss payments at selected inflation rates 
reported development method 
a method using historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and which develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
this method is used to evaluate our other than nevada business 
frequency severity method 
this method separately projects the ultimate number of claims for an accident year  based on historical claim reporting patterns  and the average cost per claim 
the average cost per claim is projected both by inflation adjusting other accident years average cost per claim  and by observing and extrapolating based on historical patterns the per claim cost observed to date for the accident year 
this method is used to evaluate our nevada business 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and also as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on one or more of industry benchmark losses per dollar of payroll for the mix of employment classes insured in our nevada business  prior evaluation dates projections of ultimate losses for the accident year  and by applying to premiums from our other than nevada business a set of initial expected loss ratios selected after analyzing the development projections for each accident year  loss trends  statutory benefit changes  and rate changes 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
the key parameters and assumptions are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  claims cost inflation rates  and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
of these  we believe the most important are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time and claims cost inflation rates 
each of these key items is discussed in the following paragraphs 
all of the methods depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time 
we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical patterns with which claims have emerged and have been paid 
to the extent that the historical data may not provide sufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our subsidiaries historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segm ent of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the losses and lae reserves at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate that the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  that new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies gradually  so that the projections will not overreact to what may turn out to be a temporary or unwarranted assumption about changes in patterns 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop many years or 
table of contents decades in the future  and it is likely that the actual development that will occur in the distant future could differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections 
the current projections would differ if different claims development patterns were selected for each benefit type 
the expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time is expressed as a percentage of ultimate losses that remain to be paid at each evaluation date for each accident year 
a lower estimate of the percentage of aggregate claims dollars remaining to be paid  when applied in the actuarial methods  produces a lower dollar estimate of the unpaid loss 
for example  the estimated percentage of losses expected to be paid more than months after the start of the accident year has been as follows for the benefit types that account for most of our loss reserves

these benefit types account for approximately of our total losses and lae reserves 
the payment patterns are reviewed each year based on the observed recent and long term patterns in our own historical data  recent and long term patterns in industry data  and analyses of potential changes in patterns resulting from major legislative benefit changes 
the changes in the payment patterns for nevada are the result of these regular reviews of our historical data and updating of the actuarial judgments involved in selecting expected payment patterns 
for and a range is shown for medical because multiple methods were used to select medical payment patterns in nevada 
the changes in the payment patterns used in states other than nevada were significantly influenced by analysis of the anticipated effects of the california legislation relating to workers compensation benefits  as well as observations of our early experience as it emerged of claims experience subsequent to the enactment of that legislation 
at each reserve evaluation  as more claims experience has emerged subsequent to that legislation  the post legislative claims experience has been given increasing judgmental weight in the actuarial selection of expected future payment patterns 
the actual payout pattern for the aggregate claims associated with an accident year will not be known until decades later  when all the claims are closed 
several of the methods also involve adjusting historical data for inflation 
for these methods  the inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year to year movements in the cost of claims observed in the data of our insurance subsidiaries and in industry wide data  as well as on broader inflation indices 
the results of these methods would differ if different inflation rates were selected 
in projections using december  data  the methods that use explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
corresponding medical cost inflation assumptions in prior projections were to at december  and to at december  the selection of medical cost inflation assumptions for use in the actuarial methodologies in each of these analyses has been based on observed recent and longer term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the economy more generally 
the rate of medical cost inflation as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim has averaged approximately over the past five to ten years  the rate of medical cost inflation in the general us economy  as measured by the consumer price index medical care  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
several of the actuarial methods depend on assumptions about claim frequency trends 
we examine the overall movement in the frequency  or number  of claims  as well as movements in the relative frequency of claims of different severities  as measured by the proportions of claims receiving different 
table of contents levels of benefit payments 
judgments about the relative proportion of claims from the most recent years that ultimately will receive benefit payments at different levels are based on historical and recent levels and movements of our claim counts and form the basis for the projection of the ultimate number of claims that will receive benefits payments for each benefit type 
the methods employed for each segment of claims data  and the relative weight accorded to each method  vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims 
for claim or benefit types that pay out for many years  and for the most recent accident periods in which the claims are relatively immature  more weight is given to methods that tend to produce more stable results by including initial expected losses or claim severities that are estimated in part by reliance on other accident years adjusted for inflation and other factors to the level of the accident year being analyzed 
all of the actuarial methods described for our nevada business are used for each of the different benefit types that are analyzed 
for benefit types in which most of the loss dollars are paid out within several years of the claim occurrence temporary total disability  permanent partial disability and vocational rehabilitation the selection of ultimate losses for all but the most recent three to five accident years is based primarily on the results of the paid development method due to the expectation that ultimate losses for the mature years will be highly correlated with the losses that have been paid to date  and the selection of estimated ultimate losses for the least mature accident years gives consideration to the results of all of the methods with the paid development method given the least consideration in the least mature that is  most recent accident year 
for benefit types that typically involve payments extending over many years or even decades p ermanent total disability  dependent benefits on fatal claims  and medical care benefits the ultimate losses for the most recent ten or more accident years may not be highly correlated with the amounts paid to date and thus the selection of estimated ultimate losses for these recent accident years is based primarily on the frequency severity method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the initial expected loss method  all of which rely in part on long term observations regarding the average cost of claims of the particular benefit type and  in the case of medical care benefits  also allow for explicit medical cost inflation assumptions 
in states other than nevada  the paid bornhuetter ferguson  reported bornhuetter ferguson  paid development  and reported development methods are used for all benefit types 
all of our claims experience in these states is immature  as a result  the results of the bornhuetter ferguson methods are given greater weight in the selection of estimated ultimate losses because these methods do not produce results that are as highly leveraged off our immature paid or reported claims experience 
for eicn  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data prior to recognition of reinsurance  and a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries  based on our reinsurance arrangements  and an analysis of large claims experience both for eicn and as reflected in industry based benchmarks 
the projections prior to recognition of reinsurance provide the basis for estimating gross of reinsurance unpaid losses  from which the projection of future reinsurance recoveries is subtracted to estimate net of reinsurance unpaid losses 
for ecic  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data net of reinsurance  and a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries  which is added to the estimated net of reinsurance unpaid losses to estimate gross of reinsurance unpaid losses 
finally  reinsurance pooling arrangements between eicn and ecic are explicitly recognized by applying factors that reflect the portion of unpaid losses tha t eicn cedes to ecic and that ecic cedes to eicn 
both management with internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary separately analyze lae and estimate unpaid lae 
this analysis relies primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically  as compared with the dollar volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods 
based on these historical relationships  and judgmental estimates of the extent to which claim management resources are focused more intensely on the initial handling of claims than on the ongoing management of claims  the consulting actuary selects a range of future lae estimates that is a function of the projected future claim payment activity 
the portion of unpaid lae that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms 
based on the results of the analyses conducted  the stability of the historical data  and the characteristics of the various claims segments analyzed  the consulting actuary selects a range of estimated 
table of contents unpaid losses and lae and a point estimate of unpaid losses and lae  for presentation to internal actuarial staff and management 
the selected range is intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall 
this range is narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely  although it is possible  that the high or low result will emerge for every state  benefit type and accident year 
the actuarial point estimate of unpaid losses and lae is based on a judgmental selection for each benefit type from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods 
management formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis 
in doing so  we make reference to the most current analyses of our consulting actuary  including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used by the consulting actuary 
comprehensive studies are conducted june and december by both internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary and on the other quarters the most recent of those study results are updated for quarterly claim reporting and claim payment activity and other information provided by the internal actuarial staff as indicated below

at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae was  million  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered i the consulting actuary s assumptions  point estimate and range  ii the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid loss and lae liabilities  and iii the particular uncertainties associated with a the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california legislature in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  b the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california system  c the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of calif ornia reforms  d the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  e the limited historical experience of ecic to use as a base for projecting future loss development  f the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions

loss reserves are our estimates at a given point in time of our ultimate liability for the cost of claims and of the cost of managing those claims  and are inherently uncertain 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future claim emergence and payment patterns and estimates of future trends in claim frequency and claim cost 
these estimates assume that the claim emergence and payment patterns  claim inflation and claim frequency trend assumptions implicitly built into our selected loss reserve will continue into the future 
unexpected changes in claim cost inflation can occur through changes in general inflationary trends  changes in medical technology and procedures  changes in wage levels and general economic conditions and changes in legal theories of compensability of injured workers and their dependents 
furth ermore  future costs can be influenced by changes in workers compensation statutory benefit structure  and benefit administration and delivery 
in applying actuarial techniques  judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical claim emergence and payment patterns and other historical data  external industry benchmark data  information about current economic conditions such as inflation  and recent changes in environmental conditions such as legislation as well as company operational changes in selecting parameters for those techniques under current facts and circumstances 
judgment also is required in selecting from among the loss indications 
table of contents produced by the several actuarial techniques that are used 
from evaluation to evaluation  it often is appropriate to adjust the various methods and parameters used in the projection of losses to reflect the expected or estimated effect of such factors 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
estimates of ultimate losses and lae may change from one balance sheet date to the next when actual claim payment or a change in individual case reserve estimates between those dates differ from the expected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserve estimate  and when actual lae expenditures differ from expected expenditure levels underlying the prior lae reserve estimate 
as actual losses and lae expenditures occur during a calendar period  they replace the portion of prior estimates of unpaid losses and lae that relate to that period 
in addition  the parameters used in the various methods and the relative weight accorded to the results of the different actuarial methods  all of which require judgment  may change as a result of observing that the actual pattern of expenditures differs from prior expectations  as well as based on new industry wide data and benchmarks derived from that data  when available 
the parameters and weights used in estimating ul timate losses may also change when external conditions such as the statutory benefit structures or the manner in which it is being interpreted and administered  or inflation differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses  and when the effects of factors related to internal operations differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses 
each of the actuarial methods used in the analysis and estimation of unpaid losses and lae depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  and the assumption that this expected pattern will prevail into the future 
we select relevant patterns as part of the periodic review and projection of unpaid losses and lae 
in selecting these patterns  we examine  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  benchmarks based on industry data and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed 
management judgment is required in selecting the amount of the loss reserve to record on our financial statements 
management reviews the various actuarial projections  the assumptions underlying those projections  the range of indications produced by the actuarial methods and the actual long term and recent emergence and payment of claims 
management also considers the environmental conditions in which the insurance subsidiaries are doing business 
in addition  management considers the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimates based on the degree of change that has occurred or is occurring in the environment and in operations

estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years decreased due to continued favorable development in such prior accident years actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
the reduction in the liability for unpaid losses and lae was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major sources of this favorable development include actual paid losses  which have been less than expected  and the impact of recalibration of selected patterns of claims emergence and claim payment used in the projection of future loss payment 
in california  in particular  where our operations began on july   the actuaries and management s initial expectations of the ultimate level of losses and patterns of loss emergence and loss payment necessarily were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in california  as no historical data from our california insurance subsidiary existed and  although some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in california  that data was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available 
the industry based benchmarks were adjusted judgmentally for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes  specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in california 
the actual emergence and payment of claims by our california insurance subsidiary has been more favorable than those initial expectations  due at least in part  we believe  to the impact of enactment of the major changes in the california environment 
other insurance companies writing california workers compensation insurance have also experienced emergence and payment of claims more favorable than anticipated 
at each evaluation date  the projected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserves has been replaced by the actual claim activity  and the expectation of future emergence and payment of california claims underlying the actuarial projections has been reevaluated periodically based both on our insurance subsidiaries emerging experience and on updating the benchmarks that are derived from observing and analyzing the insurance industry data for california workers compensation 
the change in incurred losses and lae attributable to prior years as a result of business outside nevada  predominantly 
table of contents california  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in states other than california and nevada  our insurance subsidiaries operations are relatively new and represent a minor portion of our loss reserves 
in nevada  we have compiled a lengthy history of workers compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the fund and eicn  but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long term history in nevada with the fund 
the expected patterns of claim payment and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claims payments are based on both the long term and the short term historical data 
in recent evaluations  the selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on the patterns observed in the short term historical data  as recent years claims have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with that short term historical data 
also  at each evaluation date  the projected claim payments underlying the prior loss reserves were replaced by the actual claim payment activity that occurred during the calendar year 
the change in incurred losses and lae attributable to prior years at tributable to business in nevada was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the estimate of the future cost of handling claims  or lae  depends primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically  as compared with the dollar volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical periods 
for our insurance subsidiaries business in nevada  as a result of operational improvements and reductions in staff count to align with the current and anticipated volume of business in the state  our expenditures on lae in recent years have been lower than historical levels 
as these operational improvements and staffing levels have been reflected in the actual emerging lae expenditures and in the projection of future lae  the estimates of future lae have reduced 
for our insurance subsidiaries operations in california  initial expectations of lae when operations commenced in california were based on the assumptions used by the company in pricing the california business  and on s ome limited historical data for the market segments the company was entering 
as the company s operations in california have matured  and as data relating to the company s and industry claim handling expenses reflective of the new workers compensation benefit environment in california have become available  the expectations of lae underlying the projection of future lae have been adjusted to reflect that actual costs of administering claims relative to the cost of losses themselves have been greater than initial expectations 
although our revised lae expectations resulted in an increase in the projected future cost of administering california claims relative to losses at december   and  given the significant decrease in the estimated projected costs of losses in california  the overall impact has been a decrease in lae reserves 
the changes in the company s estimates of the cost of future lae in california and nevada are included in the california and neva da development results cited in the preceding two paragraphs 
we review our loss reserves each quarter and  as mentioned earlier  our consulting actuary assists our review by performing a comprehensive actuarial analysis and projection of unpaid losses and lae twice each year 
we may adjust our reserves based on the results of our reviews and these adjustments could be significant 
if we change our estimates  these changes are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made 
our actual claims and lae experience and emergence in recent years has been more favorable than anticipated in prior evaluations  although our california lae has been higher than initially anticipated 
our insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period of dramatically changing environmental conditions in our major markets  entry into new markets  and operational changes 
during periods characterized by such changes  at each evaluation  the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long term historical and recent company data  external data  evaluations of environmental changes  and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and lae  the parameters to incorporate in those methods  and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications 
since the loss reserves are providing for claim payments that will emerge over many years  if management s projections and loss reserves were established in a manner that reacted quickly to each new emerging trend in the data or in the environment  there would be a high likelihood that future adjustments  perhaps significant in magnitude  would be required to correct for trends that turned out not to be persistent 
at each balance sheet evaluation  some losses and lae projection methods have produced indications above the loss reserve selected by management  and some losses and lae projection methods have produced 
table of contents indications lower than the loss reserve selected by management 
at each evaluation  management has given weight to new data  recent indications  and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management s expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes  as compared with long term claim payment  claim emergence  and claim cost inflation patterns 
as patterns and trends recur consistently over a period of quarters or years  management gives greater implicit weight to these recent patterns and trends in developing our future expectations 
in our view  in establishing loss reserves at each historical balance sheet date  we have used prudent judgment in balancing long term data and recent information 
it is likely that ultimate losses and lae will differ from the loss reserves recorded in our december  balance sheet 
actual losses and lae payments could be greater or less than our projections  perhaps significantly 
the following paragraphs discuss several potential sources of such deviations  and illustrate their potential magnitudes 
in recent years  emerging claims costs and claim emergence and payment patterns have improved dramatically 
the largest driver of this improvement has been california reform 
as we observe continuing improvement in development  we have given significant weight to this emerging trend in projecting and selecting estimated ultimate losses and lae 
the amount of weight to allocate between the emerging trend and historical benchmark patterns is judgmental 
we have given significant weight to the emerging trends in our selection of loss reserves as of december  however  recent data points from our business in california  as well as from insurance industry experience for california workers compensation  indicate emergence patterns more favorable than those implicitly underlying our loss reserves 
if future emergence matches those more favorable patterns  our current loss reserves could develop favorably over time 
if future claims emergence mo re closely resembles long term historical industry patterns  then our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
in nevada  we have seen a significant improvement in claims emergence and claims payment patterns in recent years  and have given these improved patterns significant weight in establishing loss reserves for our nevada business 
if future emergence in nevada more closely resembles long term historical patterns of the predecessor fund  then our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
for loss adjustment expense  particularly in nevada  our projections assume a long term cost of managing claims that is greater than the recent levels of lae produced by our insurance subsidiaries current operating model  but is less than the levels of lae expended in more distant historical past years by our insurance subsidiaries and by the fund 
future changes in claims operations  while not currently planned or contemplated  could result in future actual lae and future projections of lae that may differ from current estimates 
if future levels of lae match recent levels of lae  our current reserves for lae could develop favorably over time  if future levels of lae return to older historical levels  our current reserves for lae could develop unfavorably over time 
some of the actuarial projection methods also rely on a selection of claim cost inflation rates 
if actual claim cost inflation differs from expectations underlying prior selections  or as environmental conditions in the states in which we do business or in the economy generally change  we will reevaluate and may change the selected claim cost inflation rate in future analyses 
such a change in assumptions would cause the results of some of the actuarial methods to change from one evaluation to the next 
the ultimate cost of our claims will depend in part on actual inflation rates in future years  which may differ from the inflation expectations implicit in our loss reserves 
more than of our claims payments during the three years ended december  has related to medical care for injured workers 
the utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers compensation 
in recent years  our medical costs per claim have been rising at an average rate of approximately per year 
some of our projection methods include explicit assumptions about future medical claim cost inflation 
in projections using december  data  the methods that use explicit medical cost inflation assumptions have included medical claim cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
future medical claim cost inflation  whether due to changing medical technology  utilization of medical services  or the cost of medical services  could fall outside this range 
we are not able to state the rate of medical cost inflation that is assumed in our loss reserves because our loss reserves are established based on 
table of contents reviewing the results of actuarial methods that do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates  as well as methods that do contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates 
however  because medical care will be provided over many years  and in some cases decades  to the injured workers who have open claims  the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments 
for example  if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at december   we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of the current claims would increase by approximately million for eicn and by approximately million for ecic  on a net of reinsurance basis 
our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories 
while it is not possible to predict the impact of changes in this environment  if expanded legal theories of liability emerge  our ibnr claims may differ substantially from our ibnr reserves 
our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment 
the impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific  significant new regulation or legislation 
in the event of significant new regulation or legislation  we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business 
the range of potential variation of actual ultimate losses and lae from our current reserve for unpaid losses and lae is difficult to estimate because of the significant environmental changes in our markets  particularly california  and because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in our markets outside nevada 
furthermore  the methodologies we currently employ in evaluating our losses and lae liability do not allow us to quantify the sensitivity of our losses and lae reserves to reasonably likely changes in the underlying key assumptions 
management will refine its methodologies to provide for such capability in the future 
the range of estimates of unpaid losses and lae produced by the actuarial reviews of the impact of medical cost inflation provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and lae payments 
if the actual unpaid losses and lae were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range see the table above  the impact on our financial results would be as follows

 however  the actuarial range represents an estimated range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses and lae will fall  based on the actuarial review of the results of the various methodologies and parameters used by the actuaries in the projection of losses and lae 
each different actuarial method may produce a different indication of unpaid losses and lae because each method relies in different ways on assumptions about the future 
for example  the loss development methods are based on an assumption that the selected pattern of emergence or payout of claims will recur in the future  the frequency severity method is based on an assumption that the most recent year s ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated by inflation adjusting other accident years average cost per claim and by extrapolating based on historical patterns the per claim cost observed to date for the accident year  the initial expected loss method assumes that the ul timate losses can be estimated based on the payroll of workers insured by us and a benchmark loss cost per payroll or as a percentage of premium  and the bornhuetter ferguson methods rely on a combination of these assumptions 
actual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or methodology can represent  and each 
table of contents actuarial methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics  and thus each different actuarial methodology may produce different indications of unpaid losses and lae 
none of the methods is designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods 
nonetheless  at any given evaluation date  some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside this range  and the selection of reasonable alternative methods or reasonable alternative parameters in the actuarial projection process would produce an even wider range of potential outcomes  both above and below the range shown 
accordingly  we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes 
the magnitude of adjustments to prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae reserves that we have made at december   and  decreases of million  million  and million respectively also illustrate that changes in estimates of unpaid losses and lae can be significant from year to year 
we do not have a basis for anticipating that actual future payments of losses and lae are more likely to be either greater than or less than the reserve for unpaid losses and lae on our current balance sheet 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent a amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  b amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses  and c amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr for losses and lae 
these recoverables  by necessity  are based upon our current estimates of the underlying losses and lae  and are reported on our balance sheet separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders 
we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condit ion and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
we require reinsurers that are not admitted reinsurers in nevada and california to collateralize their share of the unearned premiums and unpaid loss reserves in order that our insurance subsidiaries receive credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements 
since our inception in  no material amounts due from reinsurers have been written off as uncollectible and  based on this experience  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
as of december   the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million 
losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled approximately million at december  we account for the lpt agreement in accordance with fas  accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short term and long duration contracts  and as retroactive reinsurance 
upon entry into the lpt agreement  an initial deferred reinsurance gain was recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
this gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent commission is estimated based on both actual results to date and projections of expected ultimate losses under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the estimated contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense in the year that the estimate is revised 
recognition of premium revenue all premium revenue is recognized over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the insurance premiums we charge are billed to our policyholders either annually or under various installment plans based on the estimated annual premium under the policy terms 
at the end of the policy term  payroll based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year 
earned but unbilled 
table of contents premiums include estimated future audit premiums 
estimates of future audit premiums are based on our historical experience 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls due to growth  economic conditions and seasonality 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations 
since our inception in  there have been no material adjustments of our accrual for earned but unbilled premium and  based on this experience  and  although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change impacts our net income or loss in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various state tax auth orities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
although we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  effective january  as of december   the company had recorded  as a liability for tax contingencies  million including interest of million 
as a result  the adoption of fin did not result in any change in the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
further  we elected to continue to record both interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation of investments our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of equity  net of deferred taxes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in operations on the specific identification basis 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  for the security and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
some of the factors we consider include

any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and 
spacer

any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments 
the amount of any write downs is determined by the difference between cost or amortized cost of the investment and its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline was identified 
since our inception in  we have recorded write downs for investment securities considered to be other than temporarily impaired of an aggregate of million 
measurement of results we evaluate our operations by using the following key measures gross premiums written 
gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance and the intercompany pooling agreement 
direct premiums written represent the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written represent the premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from an authorized state mandated pool or under previous fronting facilities 
the primary fronting facility was between ecic and clarendon insurance group clarendon and that arrangement is now in run off 
we use gross premiums written  which excludes the impact of premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
we use net premiums written  primarily in relation to gross premiums written  to measure the amount of business retained after cession to reinsurers 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned represents that portion of net premiums written equal to the expired portion of the time for which insurance protection was provided during the financial year and is recognized as revenue 
net premiums earned are used to calculate the losses and lae  underwriting and other operating expense and combined ratios  as indicated below 
losses and lae ratio 
the losses and lae ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
like many insurance companies  we analyze our losses and lae ratios on a calendar year basis and on an accident year basis 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and lae incurred during the calendar year  regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred  by the net premiums earned during that calendar year 
the calendar year losses and lae ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and lae established for insured events occurring in the current and prior periods 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio  or losses and lae for insured events that occurred during a particular year divided by the premiums earned for the year  is calculated by dividing the losses and lae  regardless of when such losses and lae are incurred  for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year 
an accident year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably  respectively  whereas the calendar year losses and lae ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods 
this ratio is an operating ratio based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our gaap financial information 
we analyze our calendar year losses and lae ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses 
table of contents and lae from all periods  including development whether favorable or unfavorable of reserves established in prior periods 
in contrast  we analyze our accident year losses and lae ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and lae from insured events occurring during that year 
while calendar year losses and lae ratios are useful in measuring our profitability  we believe that accident year losses and lae ratios are more meaningful in evaluating our underwriting performance for any particular year because an accident year losses and lae ratio better matches premium and loss information 
furthermore  accident year losses and lae ratios are not distorted by adjustments to reserves established for insured events that occurred in other periods  which may be influenced by factors that are not generally applicable to all years 
the losses and lae ratios provided in this report are calendar year losses and lae ratios  except where they are expressly identified as accident year losses and lae ratios 
commission expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned and measures the effectiveness of compensating agents and brokers for the business we have underwritten 
underwriting and other operating expense ratio 
the underwriting and other operating expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expense to net premiums earned  and measures an insurance company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is a measure used in the property and casualty insurance business to show the profitability of an insurer s underwriting  and it represents the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio and the underwriting and other operating expense ratio 
the losses and lae ratio  commission expense ratio and underwriting and other operating expense ratio express the relationship between losses and lae  commissions and underwriting and other operating expenses including policyholder dividends  respectively  to net premiums earned 
when the combined ratio is below  an insurance company experiences underwriting gain  meaning that claims payments  the cost of settling claims  commissions and underwriting expe nses are less than premiums collected 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
companies with lower combined ratios than their peers generally experience greater profitability

we define net income before impact of lpt agreement as net income less i amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and ii adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decr ease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes and net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

a any adjustment to the estimated direct reserves ceded under the lpt agreement is reflected in losses and lae for the period during which the adjustment is determined  with a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period 
there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement

net investment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the change was attributable to three factors a an increase in fixed maturity securities resulting from the reallocation of the company s investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of which increased our portfolio yield  b an increase in the invested assets  and c interest income generated by higher cash balances 
the pre tax yield on invested assets increased approximately million or approximately basis points to at december  as compared to at december  the increase in our invested assets resulted in additional investment income of nbs p  million for the year ended december  the net proceeds from the ipo generated million interest income prior to distribution to eligible members and higher cash balances generated million of additional interest income

commission expense 
commission expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  commission expense was and of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and  respectively 
commission expense decreased approximately million due to a decrease in net earned premium of million and a million favorable change in the estimated lpt agreement contingent commission 
the decrease in was partially offset by a two percentage point increase in our commission rate on select policies incepting july and after  which resulted in increased commission expense of million 
underwriting and other operating expense 
underwriting and other operating expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is composed primarily of a million increase in salaries and benefits  with a related million increase in general operating expenses and a million increase in technology maintenance and depreciation 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in professional fees and a reduction of million in the premium related expenses of premium tax  bad debt and policyholder dividends due to lower earned premiums for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in salaries and benefits and related general operating expenses were due to the increased staffing to support business needs and to meet the demands of being a public company 
employee benefit increases include higher benefit costs for medical coverage  an increased k employer match  and a new equity and incentive plan 
the technology maintenance and depreciation increased as a result of implementing eaccess  our new underwriting system  on july  with a full year of depreciation taken in the decrease in professional fees was primarily due to the one time incurred expenses related to the conversion of million 
the remainder of the decrease in professional fees was due to the reduction in the use of consultants for strategic planning of million and post implementation work of million on the new underwriting system 
the decreases in professional fees were partially offset by a million increase in legal  audit and sox compliance fees related to being a public company 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to a million decrease in pre tax income and other tax items discussed below 
the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december   was compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to three 
table of contents factors a a decline of million in realized gains in  b an increase in the ratio of tax exempt interest and dividends to pre tax income resulting from the company s reallocation of its investment portfolio in the fourth quarter  and c the million reversal of a liability for previously unrecognized tax benefits  including related interest  in third quarter additionally  in there were non deductible expenses related to the conversion 
net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net income was primarily impacted by three items a favorable reserve adjustments related to prior years for the year ended december  of million compared with million for the same period in  b realized gains of million in primarily related to the portfolio reallocation in the fourth quarter  and c the decrease in the effective tax rate to in as compared to in as described above 
net income includes amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the lpt agreement  net income would have been million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio increased percentage points  to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in the combined ratio was primarily due to recognition of a larger favorable prior accident year adjustment in as compared to  increased operating expense in  and an increase to our commission rate on select policies that was partially offset by  a favorable change in the estimated lpt contingent commission 
year ended december  compared to year ended december

we define net income before impact of lpt agreement as net income less i amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and ii adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decr ease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes and net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

the yield on invested assets increased by million or approximately of a percentage point to for year ended december  from for the year ended december  the invested assets increased million as a result of favorable investment yield and net cash flows from operations 
the increase in invested assets generated an additional million of investment income for the year ended december  realized gains losses on investments 
realized gains losses on investments increased million due to a gain of million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december  the gain was primarily attributable to a portfolio reallocation in the fourth quarter of the company evaluated its equity portfolio during the fourth quarter and elected to reduce the amount allocated to equity securities from to the target level of 
equity sales of million related to the portfolio reallocation generated realized gains of million 
additionally there was a million realized gain on the sales of equity securities due to merger and acquisition activities related to the issuing company 
these gains were offset by a realized loss of million due to other than temporary impairment adjustments 
the net realized capital loss for the year ended december  was million 
the investment activity was driven by the continued long term effort to increase after tax income and resulted in the sale of corporate and mortgage bonds as well as equity activities 
other income 
other income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in other income was primarily attributable to interest income derived from the funds withheld related to our fronting facility with clarendon 
losses and lae 
losses and lae decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  losses and lae were and of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the decrease was due to a percentage point downward adjustment in our current accident year loss estimate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this adjustment was made after observation of several successive quarters of reduced loss development in california due to the impact of regulatory reforms designed to control loss costs 
the table below reflects the losses and lae reserve adjustments for the periods specified

liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments parent company 
the primary source of cash for employers holdings  inc ehi is dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries  eicn and ecic  subject to regulatory restrictions 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be dividend payments on our common stock  the intended acquisition of amcomp  repurchase of our common stock as described in stock repurchases  and parent holding company expenses 
on february   the ehi board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of the company s shares of common stock through june  ehi expects the shares to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices in the open market 
the repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice 
there can be no assurance that ehi will complete any repurchases of its common stock pursuant to the program 
to date  the company has not repurchased any shares of common stock  see stock repurchases 
the company received approval from the nevada insurance commissioner on december   for a million extraordinary dividend from eicn special surplus which will be paid to ehi in and which can be used for stock repurchases  payment of dividends to stockholders  and general corporate purposes 
operating subsidiaries 
the primary sources of cash for eicn and ecic  our insurance operating subsidiaries  are funds generated from underwriting operations  asset maturities and income received from investments 
we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
cash provided from these sources has historically been used primarily for claims and claims adjustment expense payments and operating expenses 
in the future  we also expect to have sufficient cash from these sources for the payment of dividends to parent holding companies to the extent permitted by law  see dividend capacity 
our net cash flows are generally invested in marketable securities 
we closely monitor the duration of these investments  and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having 
table of contents adequate funds available for the payment of claims at the subsidiary level 
because our investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations  and not specific cash flows  we may from time to time be required to use our line of credit facility  which will be established by the end of second quarter at december   of our investment portfolio consisted of fixed maturity investments and consisted of equity securities 
the availability of cash to pay claims comes from our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards and the purchase of reinsurance to protect us against severe claims and catastrophic events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through july  the program consists of two master interests and liabilities agreements  one excess of loss treaty agreement and one catastrophic loss treaty agreement 
the reinsurance program provides coverage up to million per loss occurrence  subject to certain exclusions 
our loss retention for the treaty year beginning july   is million 
the coverage is subject to an aggregate loss in the first layer million in excess of our million retention of million and is limited to million for any loss to a single individual involving the second layer through six layers of our reinsurance progra m 
the second through six layers are limited to one mandatory reinstatement for an additional premium 
we believe that we are sufficiently capitalized for the above described retention 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has an rbc standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
nevada and california have adopted laws substantially similar to the naic s rbc standards 
as of december   the last date that we were required to update the annual rbc calculation  both eicn and ecic had total adjusted statutory surplus in excess of the prescribed rbc requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action 
we are currently planning to make significant capital expenditures in and it is our intention to complete the acquisition of amcomp for approximately million including the assumption of debt of amcomp 
we plan to finance the acquisition of amcomp through the issuance of debt and available cash from operations and portfolio maturities 
additionally  we expect one time integration costs of approximately million in and related to the acquisition of amcomp 
these capital expenditures planned for include approximately million of costs related to our information technology systems 
these expenditures will be financed by cash from operations and maturing investments 
dividend capacity as of december   ehi had assets  excluding its investment in subsidiaries  of million  comprised of cash and intercompany receivables 
ehi s liabilities at such date were million  comprised of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  to repurchase common stock and to pay other expenses  will be dependent  to a significant extent  upon the ability of our nevada domiciled insurance company  eicn  to pay dividends to its immediate holding company egi  and  in turn  the ability of egi  to pay dividends to its parent  ehi 
nevada law limits the payment of cash dividends by eicn to its immediate holding company by providing that payments cannot be made except from available and accumulated surplus money otherwise unrestricted unassigned and derived from realized net operating profits and realized and unrealized capital gains 
a stock dividend may be paid out of any available surplus 
a cash or stock dividend otherwise prohibited by these restrictions may only be declared and distributed upon the prior approval of the nevada commissioner  and are considered extraordinary 
eicn must give the nevada commissioner prior notice of any extraordinary dividends or distributions that it proposes to pay to its immediate holding company  even when such a dividend or distribution is to be paid out of available and otherwise unrestricted unassigned surplus 
eicn may pay such an extraordinary dividend or distribution if the nevada commissioner either approves or does not disapprove the payment within days after receiving notice of its declaration 
the maximum dividend 
table of contents that could have been made by eicn during from available unrestricted surplus without special approval  if an extraordinary dividend had not been approved in december  would have been million 
however  the company received approval on december  from the nevada commissioner for additional extraordinary dividends to be paid from eicn special surplus and which will be paid to ehi in the amount of million in as a result of the extraordinary dividend approval  any additional dividends to be paid during from special or unrestricted available surplus will require approval by the nevada commissioner 
dividends from unrestricted available surplus may require approval if other dividends have been made from special or unrestricted surplus within the prior months  or exceed certain levels 
see item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions for a further discussion of the rest rictions and requirements pertaining to the availability of additional dividends 
on october   the nevada commissioner granted eicn permission to pay up to an additional million in one or more extraordinary dividends to us subsequent to the successful completion of the initial public offering and before december  the payment of these dividends was conditioned upon the expiration of any underwriters over allotment option period  prior repayment of any expenses of the company and its subsidiaries arising from the conversion and the ipo  the exhaustion of any proceeds retained by the company from the recently completed initial public offering  maintaining the rbc total adjusted capital in eicn above a specified level on the date of declaration and payment of any particular extraordinary dividend after taking into account the effect of such dividend  and maintaining all required filings with the nevada commissioner 
the conditions were met and the million extraordinary dividend was pai d in we used the dividend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders  to repurchase our stock  and or for general corporate purposes  other than to increase executive compensation 
as the direct owner of ecic  eicn will be the direct recipient of any dividends paid by ecic 
the ability of ecic to pay dividends to eicn is limited by california law  which provides that the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities in the state of california must approve or  within a day notice period  not disapprove any dividend that  together with all other such dividends paid during the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of the paying company s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the preceding december  or b of the net income for the preceding year 
the maximum pay out that may be made by ecic to eicn during without prior approval is million 
in california  the domiciliary state of ecic the cdoi has required that in addition to applying the naic s statutory accounting practices  insurance companies must record  under certain circumstances  an additional liability  called an excess statutory reserve 
if the workers compensation losses and loss adjustment expense ratio is less than in each of the three most recent accident years  the difference is recorded as an excess statutory reserve 
in october  the california legislature passed sb which repealed the minimum reserve requirement in regards to workers compensation reserves  effective january  based on sb  the company did not record an excess statutory reserve as of december  in its annual statement  as filed with the doi in the excess statutory reserves previously required by the doi decreased ecic s statutory basis surplus by million and million to million and million at december  and  respectively  as filed with the doi 
closed block as required by nevada law  we established a closed block as of february  for the preservation of the reasonable dividend expectations of eligible members and other policyholders holding policies entitling the holder to distributions from the surplus of eicn in accordance with the terms of a dividend plan or program with respect to such policy 
the closed block was created for the benefit of a all policies issued by eicn that were in force as of february   and that were participating pursuant to a dividend plan or program of eicn  and b all policies that were no longer in force as of february   but that were participating pursuant to a dividend plan or program of eicn  that had an inception date that was not earlier than months prior to and not later than february   and for which a participating policy dividend has not been calculated  declared and paid by eicn as of february   the requirements for the closed block will end on february  and any remaining funds will revert to the company

cash flows for the year ended december  and our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash flows from operations of million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash flow from operations for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  was primarily due to a decrease of million in premiums received and an increase of million in underwriting expenses paid 
these decreases were offset by a million decrease in income taxes paid  an increase of million in investment income received and million from prepaying policy surcharges in to the california insurance guarantee association on beha lf of policyholders that are billed and collected from policyholders in subsequent periods

the net investment purchases decreased as a result of the change in operating cash flows 
the company also had million in cash used for financing activities related to the direct costs of the initial public offering 

table of contents stock repurchases on may   the ehi board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of ehi s common stock 
the stock repurchase authorization was used to return value to our stockholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
the shares were repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices in the open market 
ehi began repurchasing shares on the open market on may   and completed the stock repurchase program on october  a total of  shares of common stock  at an average repurchase price of per share  were repurchased  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as treasury stock  at cost

investments we derive investment income from our invested assets 
we invest our insurance subsidiaries total statutory surplus and funds to support our loss reserves and our unearned premiums 
as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair value of the portfolio was billion 
we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and matching the durations of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures or other liabilities 
the amounts and types of our investments are governed by statutes and regulations in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and invest excess cash in securities with appropriate duration targets to balance against anticipated future claim payments 
at december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to the latest interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be a 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of a  approximately of the ca rrying value of our investment portfolio rated aa or better 
our investment portfolio is comprised of less than of subprime mortgage debt securities or derivative securities relating thereto 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  changes in market prices of the equity securities we hold in our combined investment portfolio result in increases or decreases in our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
our objective during the past few years has been to reduce equity exposure as a percentage of our total portfolio by increasing our fixed maturity securities 
our investment strategy allows a maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio in equity securities  with our current equity allocation at of the total portfolio at december  
table of contents our equity allocation at september  was above our current selected target of and at the maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio 
we evaluated our portfolio equity allocation during the fourth quarter of and elected to reduce the amount allocated to equity securities to the target level during that period 
reducing our equity allocation has the effect of decreasing expected surplus volatility because under statutory accounting principles  equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses charged directly to surplus  in contrast to fixed income securities which are carried at amortized cost with no impact on surplus due to changes in fair value and increasing portfolio income in the fourth quarter of equity sales of million related to the portfolio reallocation generated taxable gains of million 
previous to the sales  these equity securities were recorde d on the balance sheet at fair value  with unrealized gains recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of equity 
these sales did not materially increase assets or equity 
our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset and liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints  at the consolidated and individual company level 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors at a detailed level on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning  as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn  is used in constructing an optimal portfolio 
we regularly monitor our portfolio to preserve principal values whenever possible 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is considered to be other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the security until its expected recovery of maturity 
the following table shows the market values of various categories of invested assets  the percentage of the total market value of our invested assets represented by each category and the tax equivalent yield based on the market value of each category of invested assets as of december

we regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management  including the identification of other than temporary declines in fair values 
this process includes reviewing the amount and length of time of unrealized losses on investments  historical and projected company financial performance  company specific news and other developments  the outlook for industry sectors  credit ratings and macro economic changes  including government policy initiatives 
for the months ended december   we recognized an impairment of million in the fair values of of the equity holdings in our investment portfolio as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in market value of these securities 
we believe that we have appropriately identified other than temporary declines in the fair values of our remaining unrealized losses at december  we have the ability and intent to hold fixed maturity se curities with unrealized losses for a sufficient amount of time for them to recover their values or reach maturity 
based on a review of the fixed maturity securities included in the tables set forth below  we determined that the unrealized losses were a result of the interest rate environment and not the credit quality of the issuers 
therefore  as of december  and  none of the fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were considered to be other than temporarily impaired given the severity and duration of the impairment  the credit quality of the issuers and our intent and ability to hold the securities until fair value recovers above costs 
based on a review of the investment in equity securities included in the tables set forth below  except for the million in the fair values of the equity holdings  we determined that the unrealized losses were not considered to be other than temporary due to the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuers 

table of contents the cost or amortized cost  gross unrealized gains  gross unrealized losses and estimated fair value of our investments were as follows

 estimated losses and lae reserve payment patterns have been computed based on historical information 
as a result  our calculation of loss and lae reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actual payments of losses and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and lae reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts as a result of variations between expected an d actual payout patterns 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosures about a the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  b the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and c the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january   and it will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain items at fair value 
the objective of this standard is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reporting earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
entities will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   which for the company would be the fiscal year beginning january  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
the company did not make such an election 
the 
table of contents company adopted sfas no 
on january   but elected not to measure any additional financial instruments at fair value  therefore it will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
we currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk 
credit risk investments our fixed maturity securities portfolio is also exposed to credit risk  which we attempt to manage through issuer and industry diversification 
we regularly monitor our overall investment results and review compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in fixed maturity securities of a single issuer 
as of december  and december   all of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio were rated investment grade by the securities valuation office of the naic or by standard poor s  moody s or fitch 
reinsurance we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
although our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured 
as a result  reinsurance agreements do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims to policyholders and we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers 
the am best ratings of our reinsurance carriers as of december  are set forth in this report under business reinsurance 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities  all of which were classified as available for sale as of december  the primary market risk exposure to our fixed maturity securities portfolio is interest rate risk  which we strive to limit by managing duration 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had duration of 
interest rate risk includes the risk that a security s value will change due to a change in interest rates 
for example  the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by instructing our investment manager to select fixed income investments consistent with our investment strategy 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we continually monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our liquidity obligations 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  we select a hypothetical change in market rates that reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
for invested assets  we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put  and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt 
table of contents securities are adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  excluding accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value on our fixed maturity securities including short term investments  valued at billion as of december   based on specific changes in interest rates

the sensitivity analysis model produces a predicted pre tax loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million or based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short term investments  which constituted approximately of our total invested assets as of december  with respect to investment income  the most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases fas  issued by the fasb  which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage backed securities 
the rates at which the mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities are prepaid  and therefore the average life of mortgage backed securities  can vary depending on changes in interest rates for example  mortgages are prepaid faster and the average life of mortgage backed securities falls when interest rates decline 
the adjustments for changes in amortization  which are based on revised average life assumptions  would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities holdings had been purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value 
as of december   the par value of our mortgage backed securities holdings was million 
this equates to an average price of of the par value of our total fixed maturity investment holdings 
since a majority of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at a premium or discount that is significant as a percentage of par  a fas adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income 
mortgage backed securities totaled million  or  of the portfolio as of december  agency backed mortgage pass throughs totaled million  or of the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio  and of the total portfolio 
interest rates have declined recently  leading to some increase in expected prepayment activity 
however  further declines in interest rates sufficient to significantly elevate prepayment risk from levels currently reflected in the valuations and durations of the mortgage holdings are not expected 
equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio result in decreases in the value of our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
in addition  we currently limit the percentage of equity securities held in our investment portfolio to or less of our total investment portfolio 
at december   of our investment portfolio consisted of equity securities

effects of inflation the effects of inflation could impact our financial statements and results of operations 
our estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for closure of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established  we will be required to increase reserves for losses and loss expenses with a corresponding reduction in our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends and our historical reserving results 
additionally  an actuarial estimate of increased costs is considered in setting adequate rates  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are impacted to a certain degree by the inflation rate
