accounting change effective january   the company changed the method of accounting for certain product inventories for one of its domestic legal entities from the first in  first out fifo method to the last in  first out lifo method 
this change affected approximately of the company s total gross inventory at december  as a result of this change  substantially all domestic inventories are now stated at the lower of cost determined on a lifo basis or market 
the change is preferable because it improves financial reporting by supporting the continued integration of the company s domestic bearing business  as well as provides a consistent and uniform costing method across the company s domestic operations and a reduction in the complexity of intercompany transactions 
sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  requires that a change in accounting principle be reflected through retrospective application of the new accounting principle to all prior periods  unless it is impractical to do so 
the company has determined that retrospective application to a period prior to january  is not practical as the necessary information needed to restate prior periods is not available

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas that require a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when title passes to the customer 
this occurs at the shipping point  except for certain exported goods and certain foreign entities  for which it occurs when the goods reach their destination 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements

table of contents benefit plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans which cover eligible associates 
the company also sponsors several unfunded postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and their dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including discount rate  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities against projected future pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset performance either reduces or increases net actuarial gains or losses in the current year  which ultimately affects net income in subsequent years 
for expense purposes in  the company applied a discount rate of and an expected rate of return of for the company s pension plan assets 
for expense purposes in  the company applied a discount rate of and an expected rate of return of for the company s pension plan assets 
the assumption for expected rate of return on plan assets was not changed from for a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million for a percentage point reduction in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by approximately million for for measurement purposes for postretirement benefits  the company assumed a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost health care cost trend rate for medical benefits of for  declining gradually to in and thereafter  and for  declining gradually to in and thereafter for prescription drug benefits 
the assumed health care cost trend rate may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the total service and interest components by million and would have increased the postretirement obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease would provide corresponding reductions of million and million  respectively 
the us medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act was signed into law on december  the medicare act provides for prescription drug benefits under medicare part d and contains a subsidy to plan sponsors who provide actuarially equivalent prescription plans

fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
during  the company s actuary determined that the prescription drug benefit provided by the company s postretirement plan is considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the medicare act 
the effects of the medicare act are reductions to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million and million  respectively 
the expected medicare subsidy was million  of which million was received prior to december  income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company estimates current tax due and temporary differences  resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
based on known and projected earnings information and prudent tax planning strategies  the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the company determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a charge is recorded to establish a valuation allowance against it  which increases income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
in the event that the company later determines that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a reduction in the valuation allowance is recorded  which reduces income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
net deferred tax assets relate primarily to pension and postretirement benefit obligations in the united states  which the company believes are more likely than not to result in future tax benefits 
the company recognizes net tax benefits under the recognition and measurement criteria of fin  which prescribes requirements and other guidance for financial statement recognition and measurement of positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns 
the company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
other loss reserves the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  product warranty  litigation and accounts receivable reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
these loss reserves are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances 

table of contents other matters iso the company continues its efforts to protect the environment and comply with environmental protection laws 
additionally  it has invested in pollution control equipment and updated plant operational practices 
the company is committed to implementing a documented environmental management system worldwide and to becoming certified under the iso standard to meet or exceed customer requirements 
as of the end of  of the company s plants had iso certification 
the company believes it has established adequate reserves to cover its environmental expenses and has a well established environmental compliance audit program  which includes a proactive approach to bringing its domestic and international units to higher standards of environmental performance 
this program measures performance against applicable laws  as well as standards that have been established for all units worldwide 
it is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing ones 
as previously reported  the company is unsure of the future financial impact to the company that could result from the united states environmental protection agency s epa s final rules to tighten the national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate and ozone 
the company is also unsure of potential future financial impacts to the company that could result from possible future legislation regulating emissions of greenhouse gases 
the company and certain of its us subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties by the epa for site investigation and remediation at certain sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  known as the superfund  or state laws similar to cercla 
the claims for remediation have been asserted against numerous other entities  which are believed to be financially solvent and are expected to fulfill their proportionate share of the obligation 
management believes any ultimate liability with respect to pending actions will not materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the company is also conducting voluntary environmental investigation and or remediation activities at a number of current or former operating sites 
any liability with respect to such investigation and remediation activities  in the aggregate  is not expected to be material to the operations or financial position of the company 
trade law enforcement the us government has six antidumping duty orders in effect covering ball bearings from france  germany  italy  japan and the united kingdom and tapered roller bearings from china 
the company is a producer of all of these products in the united states 
the us government determined in august that each of these six antidumping duty orders should remain in effect for five years 
continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa the cdsoa provides for distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers where the domestic producers have continued to invest in their technology  equipment and people 
the company reported cdsoa receipts  net of expenses  of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in september  the world trade organization wto ruled that cdsoa payments are not consistent with international trade rules 
in february  us legislation was enacted that would end cdsoa distributions for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the us after september  instead  any such antidumping duties collected would remain with the us treasury 
this legislation would be expected to eventually reduce any distributions in years beyond  with distributions eventually ceasing 
in july  the us court of international trade cit ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
this ruling is now under appeal 
the company is unable to determine  at this time  if such rulings will have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial results 
a federal court could rule that an appropriate remedy would be to return distributions received in prior years 
the company is unable to determine  at this time  the likelihood of a federal court finally ruling on any particular remedy 
in addition to the cit rulings  there are a number of factors that can affect whether the company receives any cdsoa distributions and the amount of such distributions in any given year 
these factors include  among other things  potential additional changes in the law  ongoing and potential additional legal challenges to the law and the administrative operation of the law 
accordingly  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of cdsoa distributions it will receive in future years  if any 
it is possible that cit rulings might prevent the company from receiving any cdsoa distributions in and beyond 
any reduction of cdsoa distributions would reduce the company s earnings and cash flow 
quarterly dividend on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
the dividend will be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of february  this will be the rd consecutive dividend paid on the common stock of the company

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates related to several separate funding sources impact the company s earnings 
these sources are borrowings under an asset securitization  borrowings under the million senior credit facility  floating rate tax exempt us municipal bonds with a weekly reset mode and short term bank borrowings at international subsidiaries 
the company is also sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates  as they influence million of debt that is subject to interest rate swaps 
the company has interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million to hedge a portion of its fixed rate debt 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  the company receives interest at fixed rates and pays interest at variable rates 
the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps are january  and february  if the market rates for short term borrowings increased by one percentage point around the globe  the impact would be an increase in interest expense of million with a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes of the same amount 
the amount was determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  year end debt balances by category and an estimated impact on the tax exempt municipal bonds interest rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  also impact the company s earnings 
the greatest risk relates to products shipped between the company s european operations and the united states 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge these intercompany transactions 
additionally  hedges are used to cover third party purchases of product and equipment 
as of december   there were million of hedges in place 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in a charge of million for these hedges 
in addition to the direct impact of the hedged amounts  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
