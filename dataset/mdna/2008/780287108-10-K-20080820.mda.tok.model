item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of royal gold and its subsidiaries 
this discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three fiscal years ended june   and overview royal gold  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or production from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or near production in exchange for royalty interests 
we are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalties  to create new royalties through the financing of mine development or exploration  or to acquire companies that hold royalties 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  analysis of technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of indications of interest  participation in preliminary discussions and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions 
we also fund exploration on properties thought to contain precious metals and seek to obtain royalties and other carried ownership interests in such properties through the subsequent transfer of operating interests to other mining companies 
substantially all of our revenues are and will be expected to be derived from royalty interests 
we do not conduct mining operations at this time 
during the fiscal year  we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests  the acquisition of royalty interests  and the creation of royalty interests through financing and strategic exploration alliances 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and other metals  as well as production from our producing stage royalty interests 
the price of gold and other metals have fluctuated widely in recent years 
the average price of gold per ounce during our fiscal year  and was  and  respectively 
the marketability and the price of gold are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the company and may have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the increase in the average gold price  the continued ramp up of gold production at the taparko and leeville mines  increased production at robinson and leeville  and production from the recently acquired battle mountain royalties  contributed to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal year ended june  the increase in our royalty revenue during the fiscal year was slightly offset due to a decrease in production at the cortez and certain other of our principal producing royalties

under sfas r  legal fees and other transaction related costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
sfas r also requires  among other things  acquirers to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition

sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value

under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability

the company adopted fin on july  refer to note for a discussion regarding the effect of adopting fin critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that the company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of third party mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation  depletion and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions

royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized royalty revenue of approximately million 
royalty revenue is recognized pursuant to guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition for financial statements 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying royalty agreements subject to i the pervasive evidence of the existence of the arrangements  ii the risks and rewards having been transferred  iii the royalty being fixed or determinable  and iv the collectability of the royalty being reasonably assured 
for royalty payments received in gold  royalty revenue is recorded at the average spot price of gold for the period in which the royalty was earned 
revenue recognized pursuant to the robinson royalty agreement is based upon three percent of revenue received by the operator of the mine  quadra  for the sale of minerals from the robinson mine  reduced by certain costs incurred by quadra 
quadra s concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters  in general  provide for an initial payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices at the date of shipment 
final true up payments are subsequently based upon final assays and market metal prices set on a specified future dates  typically one to three months after the date the concentrate arrives at the third party smelter which generally occurs three to six months after the shipment date from the robinson mine 
royal gold recognizes revenue under the robinson royalty agreement based on amounts contractually due pursuant to the calculations above for the underlying sale 
as a result of pricing variations in gold  silver and copper over the respective settlement period  royalty revenue recognized on the robinson royalty could be positively or negatively impacted by any changes in metal prices  between the provisional and final settlement periods
