this item should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements 
see exhibits and financial statement schedules 
overview we are a biotechnology company developing surfactant replacement therapies srt for respiratory disorders and diseases 
surfactants are produced naturally in the lungs and are essential for breathing 
our proprietary technology produces a precision engineered surfactant that is designed to closely mimic the essential properties of natural human lung surfactant 
we believe that through this srt technology  pulmonary surfactants have the potential  for the first time  to be developed into a series of respiratory therapies to treat conditions for which there are few or no approved therapies available for patients in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu  pediatric intensive care unit picu  intensive care unit icu and other hospital settings 
our srt pipeline is focused initially on the most significant respiratory conditions prevalent in the nicu and picu 
we have filed a new drug application nda with the us food and drug administration fda for our lead product  surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
the fda has established may  as its target date to complete its review of this nda 
we are also developing surfaxin for the treatment of acute respiratory failure arf in children up to two years of age suffering and for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd in premature infants  a debilitating and chronic lung disease typically affecting premature infants who have suffered rds 
aerosurf is our proprietary srt in aerosolized form and is being developed for the treatment of rds in premature infants 
aerosurf has the potential to obviate the need for endotracheal intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation and holds the promise to significantly expand the use of surfactants in respiratory medicine 
we also believe that our srt will potentially address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions such as acute lung injury ali  cystic fibrosis cf  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  asthma  and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  that affect other pediatric  young adult and adult patients in the icu and other hospital settings we are implementing a business strategy that includes continued investment in the development of our srt pipeline programs  initially focused on surfaxin and aerosurf for neonatal and pediatric conditions  including ongoing efforts intended to gain regulatory approval to market and sell surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in the united states 
the fda accepted our complete response to the april approvable letter and has established may  as its target date to complete its review of our surfaxin nda  preparing for the potential approval and launch of surfaxin for rds in the united states  including building our own commercial sales and marketing organization specialized in neonatal and pediatric indications to execute the launch of surfaxin in the united states  seeking collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships in the international markets for the development and potential commercialization of our srt pipeline  including surfaxin and aerosurf 
we have a corporate partnership with laboratorios del dr 
esteve  sa  primarily for the marketing and sales of surfaxin and certain of our other srt products in southern europe 
we continue to evaluate a variety of other potential strategic international and domestic collaborations intended to support the future growth of our srt pipeline and enhance shareholder value  continued investment in our quality systems and manufacturing capabilities  including our recently completed analytical laboratories in warrington  pennsylvania and our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
we plan to manufacture sufficient drug product to meet the anticipated pre clinical  clinical  formulation development and potential future commercial requirements of surfaxin  aerosurf and our other srt product candidates 
for our aerosolized srt  we plan to collaborate with engineering device experts and use contract manufacturers to produce aerosol devices and related components to meet our development and potential future commercial requirements 
our long term manufacturing strategy includes potentially expanding our existing facilities or building or acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities for the production and development of our precision engineered srt drug products  and seeking investments of additional capital  including potentially from business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  equity financings and other similar opportunities  although we cannot assure you that we will identify or enter into any specific actions or transactions 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million including historical results of predecessor companies 
the majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and  during and the first half  also include significant general and administrative expense  primarily pre commercialization activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operations 
historically  we have funded our operations with working capital provided principally through public and private equity financings  debt arrangements and strategic collaborations 
as of december   we had i cash of million  ii approximately million shares potentially available for issuance under a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  for future financings not to exceed million  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  iii million outstanding million principal and million of accrued interest as of december  on a loan from pharmabio development inc d b a novaquest pharmabio  the strategic investment group of quintiles transnational corp 
quintiles  which  after a restructuring  is due and payable  together with all accrued interest  on april   and iv million outstanding on under our equipment financing facility with gecc  as successor to merrill lynch capital 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
these costs are charged to operations as incurred and are tracked by category rather than by project 
research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with manufacturing development  research  formulation development  clinical and regulatory operations and other direct preclinical and clinical projects 
in  we incurred a non recurring charge of million associated with the purchase of the manufacturing operations at the totowa  new jersey  facility  which was classified as in process research and development 
this non recurring charge is not reflected in the following discussion 
these cost categories typically include the following expenses manufacturing development manufacturing development primarily reflects costs incurred to develop current good manufacturing practices cgmp manufacturing capabilities 
manufacturing development includes costs associated with manufacturing activities at operations in totowa  new jersey to support the production of clinical and anticipated commercial drug supply for our srt programs  such as employee expenses  depreciation  the purchase of drug substances  quality control and assurance activities  and analytical services  investments in our quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities  including ongoing enhancements to quality controls  process assurance and documentation and expanding and upgrading our quality operations to meet production requirements for our srt pipeline in accordance with cgmp  and expenses associated with our comprehensive investigation of the april surfaxin process validation stability failure  remediation of our related manufacturing issues and activities associated with obtaining related data and other information included in our complete response to the april surfaxin approvable letter 
unallocated development clinical  regulatory  formulation development and medical affairs clinical  regulatory and formulation development activities include preparation  implementation and management of our clinical trial programs in accordance with current good clinical practices cgcps  research and development of aerosolized and other formulations of our precision engineered srt  engineering of aerosol delivery systems and analytical chemistry activities to support the continued development of surfaxin

unallocated development also includes medical affairs activities  primarily consisting of medical science liaisons personnel providing medical education about the use of surfactants 
direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses include pre clinical activities  activities associated with the development of our srt formulations aerosolization systems prior to initiation of any potential human clinical trials  and activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including patient enrollment costs  external site costs  costs of clinical drug supply and related external costs such as contract research consultant fees and expenses 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses by each of the foregoing categories for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses manufacturing development unallocated development clinical  regulatory  etc 
direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses total research and development expenses included in research and development expenses for the year ended december  and is a charge of million and million associated with stock based employee compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
r  respectively 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing of completion  and ultimate cost of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable and data from clinical trials are subject to varying interpretation and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
currently  none of our drug product candidates are available for commercial sale 
all of our potential products are in regulatory review  clinical or pre clinical development 
the status and anticipated completion date of each of our lead srt programs are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operations 
successful completion of development of our srt is contingent on numerous risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are described in detail in risk factors 
corporate partnership agreements chrysalis technologies  a division of philip morris usa inc in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with chrysalis through which we gained exclusive license rights to chrysalis aerosolization technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases 
the alliance unites two complementary respiratory technologies our precision engineered surfactant technology with chrysalis novel aerosolization technology that is being developed to deliver therapeutics to the deep lung 
we and chrysalis are utilizing our respective capabilities and resources to support and fund the design and development of combination drug device systems that can be uniquely customized to address specific respiratory diseases and patient populations 
chrysalis is responsible for developing the design for the initial prototype aerosolization device platform and disposable dose packets 
we are responsible for aerosolized srt drug formulations  clinical and regulatory activities  and further development  manufacturing and commercialization of the combination drug device products

laboratorios del dr 
esteve  sa in december  we restructured our strategic alliance with laboratorios del dr 
esteve  sa esteve for the development  marketing and sales of our products 
under the restructuring  we regained full commercialization rights to our srt  including surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants and the treatment of ards in adults  in key european markets  central america  and south america 
esteve will focus on andorra  greece  italy  portugal  and spain  and now has development and marketing rights to a broader portfolio of potential srt products 
esteve will pay us a transfer price on sales of surfaxin and other srt 
we will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of all of the covered products and esteve will be responsible for all sales and marketing in the revised territory 
we also agreed to pay to esteve of any cash up front and milestone fees not to exceed million in the aggregate that we may receive in connection with any future strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of surfaxin for rds  ards or certain other srts in the territory for which we had previously granted a license to esteve 
esteve has agreed to make stipulated cash payments to us upon our achievement of certain milestones  primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for the covered products 
in addition  esteve has agreed to contribute to phase clinical trials for the covered products by conducting and funding development performed in the revised territory 
plan of operations we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to continue to make significant investments for continued product research  development  manufacturing  and general business activities 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales  related royalties and transfer prices to achieve and maintain profitability 
through december   we had no revenues from any product sales  and had not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon  among other things  our ability to develop products  obtain regulatory approval for products under development and enter into collaboration and other agreements for product development  manufacturing and commercialization 
in addition  our results are dependent upon the performance of our strategic partners and suppliers 
moreover  we may never achieve significant revenues or profitable operations from the sale of any of our products or technologies 
through december   we had not generated taxable income 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal tax purposes were approximately million 
the future utilization of such loss carryforward may be limited pursuant to regulations promulgated under section of the internal revenue code 
in addition  we had a research and development tax credit carryforward of million at december  the federal net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in through we anticipate that during the next to months research and development we will focus our research  development and regulatory activities in an effort to develop a pipeline of potential srt for respiratory diseases 
the drug development  clinical trial and regulatory process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and subject to numerous risks including  without limitation  the applicable risks discussed in herein and those contained in the risk factors 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations research and development 
our major research and development projects include srt for neonatal intensive care unit in order to address the most prevalent respiratory disorders affecting infants in the nicu and picu  we are conducting several nicu and picu therapeutic programs targeting respiratory conditions cited as some of the most significant unmet medical needs for the neonatal and pediatric community 
surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants we have filed an nda with the us food and drug administration fda for our lead product  surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
the fda has established may  as its target date to complete its review of this nda 
in april  we received a second approvable letter from the fda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
specifically  the fda requested information primarily focused on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section of our nda  predominately involving drug product specifications and stability  analytical methods and related controls 
also in april  ongoing analysis of surfaxin process validation batches that had been manufactured for us in by laureate as a requirement for our nda indicated that certain stability parameters no longer met acceptance criteria 
we immediately conducted a comprehensive investigation  which focused on analysis of our manufacturing processes  analytical methods and method validation  and active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers 
as a result of our investigation  we identified a most probable root cause to the process validation stability failures and executed a corrective action and preventative action capa plan 
in december  we attended a meeting with the fda to clarify certain of the key cmc matters identified in the april approvable letter  provide information concerning our comprehensive investigation into the process validation stability failures and remediation of the related manufacturing issues  and obtain guidance from the fda on the appropriate path to potentially gain approval of surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
in february  we completed manufacture of three new surfaxin process validation batches  which are subject to ongoing comprehensive stability testing in accordance with an established protocol that complies with guidelines established by the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich 
we included six month stability data on these batches in our response to the approvable letter and  as of march  we have submitted our month stability data to the fda 
in november  we submitted to the fda our formal response to the april approvable letter 
the fda accepted our response as a complete response and established may  as its target date to complete its review of the nda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
in october  we filed a marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines agency emea for clearance to market surfaxin for the prevention and rescue treatment of rds in premature infants in europe 
following the surfaxin process validation stability failure  we determined that we could not resolve our manufacturing issues within the regulatory time frames mandated by the emea procedure 
consequently  in june  we voluntarily withdrew the maa without resolving with the emea certain outstanding clinical issues related to the surfaxin phase clinical trials 
we plan in the future to have further discussions with the emea and potentially develop a strategy to gain approval for surfaxin in europe 
surfaxin for the prevention of bpd in premature infants in october  we announced preliminary results of our phase clinical trial for surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of bpd  which was designed as an estimation study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of surfaxin in infants at risk for bpd 
we believe that these results suggest that surfaxin may potentially represent a novel therapeutic option for infants at risk for bpd 
we currently plan to seek scientific advice from the fda and other regulatory agencies with respect to potential clinical trial designs to support the further development of surfaxin for the prevention of bpd 
surfaxin for infants and children suffering from acute respiratory failure in june  we initiated a clinical trial to determine if restoration of surfactant with surfaxin will improve lung function and result in a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and nicu picu stay for children up to two years of age suffering with arf 
the phase clinical trial is a multicenter  randomized  masked  placebo controlled trial that will compare surfaxin to standard of care represented by a sham air control 
approximately children under the age of two with arf will receive standard of care and be randomized to receive either surfaxin at ml kg of body weight expected weight range up to kg or sham air control 
the trial will be conducted at approximately sites throughout the world in both the northern and southern hemispheres 
the objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of surfaxin administration and to assess whether such treatment can decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation in young children with arf 
patient enrollment has been slower than expected and  as a result  we have extended the period for patient enrollment  originally expected to conclude in mid  through an additional viral season at existing and planned new clinical sites in the northern and southern hemispheres 
at that time  we will assess the status of patient enrollment in this trial and determine whether further adjustments to our timeline are required 
currently  we believe that data from this trial will be available in the first half of aerosurf  aerosolized srt in september  we completed and announced the results of our first pilot phase clinical study of aerosurf for the prevention of rds in premature infants  which was designed as an open label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety and tolerability of aerosurf delivered using a commercially available aerosolization device aeroneb pro via ncpap administered within minutes of birth over a three hour duration 
the study showed that it is feasible to deliver aerosurf via ncpap and that the treatment was generally safe and well tolerated 
we are presently collaborating with chrysalis on a novel aerosolization system to deliver aerosurf to patients in the nicu 
in anticipation of planned clinical trials  we are executing a series of supportive pre clinical studies 
our design engineers  together with chrysalis and our contract manufacturers  are optimizing the initial prototype version of this novel aerosolization system 
once development milestones have been achieved  we expect to receive from chrysalis the prototype aerosolization system technology platform  with which we plan to manufacture aerosolization systems for use in clinical trials 
in that regard  we have met with and received guidance from the fda with respect to the design of a proposed phase clinical program  which we currently expect to initiate in mid  utilizing our novel aerosolization technology 
we are also currently discussing with chrysalis a plan for the further development of our aerosurf program  including conceptualization and development of the next generation aerosolization system 
for this phase of development  we anticipate seeking the assistance of design engineers and medical device experts who have a track record of developing and gaining regulatory approval for medical devices and drug device combination products  both in the united states and other international markets 
if we are successful  we plan to use our next generation version of the aerosolization system in our planned phase clinical trials and  if approved  in future commercial activities 
with the knowledge that we gain from our development activities related to the nicu and picu  we plan to develop a program utilizing this novel aerosolization technology to develop aerosolized srt administered as a prophylactic for adult patients in the hospital setting 
srt for critical care and hospital indications we are also evaluating the potential development of our proprietary precision engineered srt to address respiratory disorders such as cf  ali  copd  asthma  and other debilitating respiratory conditions 
manufacturing our precision engineered surfactant product candidates  including surfaxin  must be manufactured in compliance with cgmp established by the fda and other international regulatory authorities 
surfaxin is a complex drug and  unlike many drugs  contains four active ingredients 
it must be aseptically manufactured at our facility as a sterile  liquid suspension and requires ongoing monitoring of drug product stability and conformance to specifications 
we plan to invest in and support our manufacturing strategy for the production of our precision engineered srt to meet anticipated clinical needs and  if approved  commercial needs in the united states  europe and other markets current manufacturing capabilities in december  we purchased our manufacturing operations from laureate our contract manufacturer at that time and completed the transition of all related activities from laureate in july owning the totowa manufacturing operations has provided us with direct operational control and  we believe  potentially improved economics for the production of clinical and potential commercial supply of our lead product  surfaxin  and our srt pipeline products 
in april  ongoing analysis of our initial surfaxin process validation batches that were manufactured for us in by laureate as a requirement for our nda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants indicated that certain stability parameters no longer met acceptance criteria 
we immediately initiated a comprehensive investigation  which focused on analysis of manufacturing processes  analytical methods and method validation and active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers  to determine the cause of the failure 
as a result of this investigation  we developed a corrective action and preventative action capa plan to remediate the related manufacturing issues 
we expect the fda to complete an inspection of this facility as part of its review of our surfaxin nda  for which the fda has currently established a target date of may  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operations research and development srt for neonatal intensive care unit surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
in february  consistent with guidance obtained at a december meeting with the fda  we completed the manufacture of three new surfaxin process validation batches  which are subject to ongoing comprehensive stability testing in accordance with an established protocol that complies with guidelines established by the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich 
we included six month stability data on these batches in our response to the approvable letter and  as of march  we have submitted our month stability data to the fda 
our manufacturing strategy includes ongoing investment in our analytical and quality systems to support our manufacturing and development activities 
in october  we completed construction of a new analytical and development laboratory in our warrington  pennsylvania corporate headquarters 
the new laboratory will consolidate the analytical  quality and development activities that are presently located in doylestown  pennsylvania and mountain view  california  including release and stability testing of raw materials as well as commercial and clinical drug product supply 
we also expect to perform development work with respect to our aerosolized srt and novel formulations of our product candidates 
the laboratory will expand our capabilities by providing additional capacity to conduct analytical testing as well as opportunities to leverage our newly consolidated professional expertise across a broad range of projects  improving both operational efficiency and financial economics 
long term manufacturing capabilities we are planning to have manufacturing capabilities  primarily through our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey that should allow for sufficient commercial production of surfaxin  if approved  to supply the potential worldwide demand for our rds  arf and bpd programs and all of our anticipated clinical and potential commercial production requirements for aerosurf 
we view our acquisition of manufacturing operations in totowa as an initial step of our manufacturing strategy for the continued development of our srt portfolio  including life cycle management of surfaxin for new indications  potential new formulations and formulation enhancements  and expansion of our aerosol srt products  beginning with aerosurf 
the lease for our totowa facility expires in december in addition to customary terms and conditions  the lease is subject to a right in the landlord  first exercisable after december and upon two years prior notice  to terminate the lease early 
this termination right is subject to certain conditions  including that the master tenant  a related party of the landlord  must have ceased all activities at the premises  and  in the earlier years  if we satisfy certain financial conditions  the landlord must make payments to us of significant early termination amounts 
taking into account this early termination option  which could require us to move out of our totowa facility as early as march  our long term manufacturing strategy includes building or acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities for the production of our precision engineered surfactant drug products  as well as using contract manufacturers  for the production of our precision engineered srt drug products 
aerosol devices and related componentry to manufacture our aerosolization systems for our planned clinical trials  we expect to utilize third party contract manufacturers  suppliers and integrators 
the manufacturing process involves assembly of key device sub components that comprise the aerosolization systems  including the aerosol generating device  disposable dose delivery packets  which must be assembled in a clean room environment  and patient interface systems necessary to administer our aerosolized srt 
under our manufacturing plan  third party vendors will manufacture customized parts for us and assemble the key device sub components and ship them to one central location for final assembly and integration into the aerosolization system 
once assembled  the critical drug product contact components and patient interface systems will be packaged and sterilized 
the aerosolization systems will be quality control tested prior to release for use in our clinical trials 
we have entered into a master services agreement with kloehn  inc to act as integrator of the prototype aerosolization system device sub components and disposable dose delivery packets that we plan to use in our planned phase clinical trials 
see the applicable risks related to our manufacturing activities and our long term manufacturing strategy discussed in risk factors 
sales and marketing to prepare for the anticipated approval of surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants  we are establishing our own us specialty pulmonary sales and marketing organization that will initially specialize in neonatal and pediatric indications and  as products are developed  will potentially expand to critical care and hospital settings 
this strategic initiative is intended to allow us to manage and administer our own sales and marketing operation  establish a strong presence in the nicu  and optimize the economics of our business 
we anticipate that the fda will potentially grant approval of our surfaxin nda in may and that the us commercial launch of surfaxin will occur later in the year 
we have initiated marketing and related activities  including the hiring of experienced management personnel  and plan to hire sales and marketing representatives following receipt of approval to market surfaxin 
additionally  we are also enhancing our medical affairs capabilities to provide for increased scientific and educational activities 
we expect to rely primarily on our marketing and sales team to market surfaxin  if approved  in the united states 
we expect to incur significant expenses in developing our us marketing and sales team 
we also intend to pursue potential collaboration arrangements with international partners to co develop and or co commercialize our neonatal and pediatric pipeline for surfaxin and aerosurf 
general and administrative we intend to invest in general and administrative resources in the near term primarily to support our legal requirements  intellectual property portfolios including building and enforcing our patent and trademark positions  our business development initiatives  financial systems and controls  management information technologies  and general management capabilities 
potential collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships we intend to seek investments of additional capital and potentially enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of our srt product candidates 
from june to july  we engaged jefferies company  inc jefferies  a new york based investment banking firm  under an exclusive arrangement to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives intended to enhance the future growth potential of our srt pipeline and maximize shareholder value 
we continue to evaluate a variety of strategic transactions  including  but not limited to  potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  financings and other similar opportunities  although we cannot assure you that we will enter into any specific actions or transactions

in november  we filed our complete response to the second approvable letter and are now preparing for the anticipated potential approval in may and us commercial launch of surfaxin for rds in premature infants  including establishing our own us commercial sales and marketing organization specialized in neonatal and pediatric indications 
restructuring charge in april  following the april surfaxin process validation stability failure  which delayed fda review of our nda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants  we reduced our staff levels and reorganized corporate management to lower our cost structure and re align our operations with changed business priorities 
included in the workforce reduction were three senior executives 
the reduction in workforce totaled employees  representing approximately of our workforce  and was focused primarily on our commercial infrastructure 
all affected employees were eligible for certain severance payments and continuation of benefits 
additionally  certain pre launch commercial programs were discontinued 
such commercial program expenses totaled approximately million for the fourth quarter and first quarter we incurred a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter associated with the staff reductions and close out of certain pre launch commercial programs  which was accounted for in accordance with statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and is identified separately on the statement of operations as restructuring charge 
this charge included million of severance and benefits related to staff reductions and million for the termination of certain pre launch commercial programs 
as of december   payments totaling million had been made related to these items and million were unpaid and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in process research development in december  we purchased laureate s manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey  for million and incurred additional related expenses of million 
we use this facility for pharmaceutical manufacturing and development activities 
we believe this acquisition was a logical initial step to implement a long term manufacturing strategy to support the continued development of our srt portfolio  including life cycle management of surfaxin for new indications  potential new formulations and enhancements  and expansion of our aerosol srt products  beginning with aerosurf 
the manufacturing facility in totowa consists of approximately  square feet of leased pharmaceutical manufacturing and development space that is specifically designed for the manufacture and filling of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp 
there are approximately personnel that are qualified in sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing and currently employed at the facility 
in consideration for million paid to laureate  we received the following an assignment of the existing lease of the totowa facility  with a lease term expiring in december see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources operating leases  equipment and leasehold improvements related to the totowa facility  and the right to employ the majority of the personnel that were qualified in sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing and that were employed by laureate at the totowa facility at that time 
in connection with this transaction  we incurred a non recurring charge  classified as in process research development in accordance with statement no 
accounting for research development costs  of million associated with the purchase of the manufacturing operations at the totowa  new jersey  facility 
additionally  in connection with the acquisition  we financed million pursuant to our equipment financing facility  at that time with general electric capital corporation gecc  to financially support the purchase of the manufacturing operations 
other income and expense other income and expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
interest and other income for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest and other income consists of interest earned on our cash and marketable securities and proceeds of the sale of our commonwealth of pennsylvania research and development tax credits million in and million in we did not sell tax credits in 
interest  amortization and other expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in versus was primarily due to i interest expense of million in compared to million in related to the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with warrants issued to pharmabio in october in consideration for renegotiating the terms on the existing million loan and ii a prepayment penalty of million incurred in the second quarter associated with the prepayment of our outstanding indebtedness with gecc 
the increase in versus was primarily due to higher outstanding balances with our loan and equipment financing facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to continue to make significant investments for continued product research  development  manufacturing and commercialization activities 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and the use of debt and our equipment financing facility 
we are subject to risks customarily associated with the biotechnology industry  which requires significant investment for research and development 
there can be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  or that any approved product will be commercially viable 
we plan to fund our research  development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities through the issuance of equity and debt financings  payments from potential strategic collaborators  including license fees and sponsored research funding  sales of surfaxin  if approved  sales of our other product candidates  if approved  equipment financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of the product development and commercialization plan 
even if we succeed in developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed with acceptable terms  if at all 
from june to july  we engaged jefferies under an exclusive arrangement to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives intended to enhance the future growth potential of our srt pipeline and maximize shareholder value 
during that period  we raised million in a private placement transaction in november  and in april  we raised million million net in a registered direct offering

cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  as compared to million as of december  the increase is primarily due to i in april  a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock to select institutional investors

the ceff allows us to raise capital  subject to certain conditions that we must satisfy  at the time and in amounts deemed suitable to us  during a three year period that began on may  we are not obligated to utilize the entire million available under this ceff 
the purchase price of shares sold to kingsbridge under the ceff is at a discount ranging from to percent of the volume weighted average of the price of our common stock vwap for each of the eight trading days following our initiation of a draw down under the ceff 
the discount on each of these eight trading days is determined as follows vwap of vwap applicable discount greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than or equal to per share as such term is set forth in the common stock purchase agreement 
if on any trading day during the eight trading day pricing period for a draw down  the vwap is less than the greater of i or ii percent of the closing price of our common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the beginning of the draw down period  no shares will be issued with respect to that trading day and the total amount of the draw down for that pricing period will be reduced for each such trading day by one eighth of the draw down amount that we had initially specified 
our ability to require kingsbridge to purchase our common stock is subject to various limitations 
each draw down is limited to the lesser of percent of the closing price market value of our outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of the draw down or million 
unless kingsbridge agrees otherwise  a minimum of three trading days must elapse between the expiration of any draw down pricing period and the beginning of the next draw down pricing period 
in addition  kingsbridge may terminate the ceff under certain circumstances  including if a material adverse effect relating to our business continues for trading days after notice of the material adverse effect

factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our research and development activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others 
investments in property and equipment in october  we completed construction of a new analytical and development laboratory in our warrington  pennsylvania corporate headquarters 
the new laboratory will consolidate the analytical  quality and development activities that are presently located in doylestown  pennsylvania and mountain view  california  including release and stability testing of raw materials as well as commercial and clinical drug product supply

future capital requirements unless and until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to require substantial additional funding to conduct our business  including our manufacturing  research and product development activities and to repay our indebtedness 
our operations will not become profitable before we exhaust our current resources  therefore  we will need to raise substantial additional funds through additional debt or equity financings or through collaborative or joint development or commercialization arrangements with potential corporate partners
