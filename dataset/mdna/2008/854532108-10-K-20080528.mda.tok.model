item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward looking statements as a result of various risks  including but not limited to those risks identified in the section of this report entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report overview we provide information technology services and solutions to us defense and federal civilian government agencies 
we offer our customers solutions and expertise to support their mission essential needs at any stage of program  product development or business lifecycle through five service areas systems engineering  enterprise integration  operational logistics  business process outsourcing and advanced engineering and technology 
as a systems integrator  we apply these five service areas to enable our customers to achieve interoperability between different business processes and information technology systems 
contracts funded by federal government agencies account for substantially all of our revenues 
as of march   we had more than active contractual engagements across federal government agencies 
our customers include the department of defense including all major agencies within the department of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  the department of transportation  the department of the treasury  nasa  the department of justice  and the department of health and human services 
key metrics evaluated by management we manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of financial and non financial metrics derived from  and in addition to  our united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  results 
the most significant of these metrics are discussed below 
revenue growth we closely monitor revenue growth in order to assess the performance of our business 
in monitoring our revenue growth  we focus on both internal revenue growth and revenue growth through acquisitions 
our internal revenue growth is driven primarily by two factors 
first  internal revenue growth is driven by adding new customers and by obtaining new task orders and contracts with our existing customers 
for example  over the past several years we have added the department of homeland security s citizenship and immigration services  the department of the treasury s office of the comptroller of the currency  the national guard bureau  the department of transportation and agencies in the intelligence community as new customers 
second  organic revenue growth is driven by increasing revenues under existing contracts and task orders with customers 
for example  since the initial award of our contract with the department of state for the provision of passport processing and support services  the scope of services provided by us  and the revenues generated by those services  have grown significantly 
our revenue growth strategy also includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
we have completed the following five acquisitions since our acquisition of gci in january  our acquisition of cci in september  our acquisition of fsc in december  our acquisition of morgan in february  and our acquisition of techrizon in april backlog we monitor backlog  which provides us with visibility of our future revenues  as a measure of the strength of our target markets and our ability to retain existing contracts and win new contracts 
the following table summarizes our backlog as of the dates indicated as of march  in millions backlog funded unfunded  total backlog  each year  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from our backlog  and a significant portion of our backlog represents work related to the continuation of services and solutions under contracts or projects where we are the incumbent provider 
we define backlog as the amount of revenues we expect to realize i over the remaining base contract performance period and ii from the exercise by the customer of option periods that we reasonably believe will be exercised  in each case from signed contracts in existence as of the measurement date 
we do not include contract ceiling values  which represent the maximum amount of contract awards that could be awarded to all contractors under gwac or multiple award id iq contracts  in our backlog calculation 
we also do not include in backlog i the expected amount of revenues that would be realized if  and when  we were successful in the re compete of signed contracts in existence as of the measurement date or ii the expected amount of revenues that would be realized from future unidentified growth on signed contracts and task orders in existence as of the measurement date 
we define funded backlog as the portion of our backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to us under a signed contract or task order by the purchasing agency  or otherwise authorized for payment to us by a customer upon completion of a specified portion of work  less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized under the contract 
our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contracts  because congress often appropriates funds to be used by an agency for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis  even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years 
as a result  contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term  and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract 
contract mix we work with the federal government under contracts employing one of three types of price structures cost plus fee  time and materials and fixed price 
cost plus fee contracts are typically lower risk arrangements and thus yield lower profit margins than time and materials and fixed price arrangements 
because the customer usually specifies the type of contract for a particular contractual engagement  we generally do not influence the choice of contract type 
however  where we do have the opportunity to influence the contract type  and where customer requirements are clear  we prefer time and materials and fixed price arrangements rather than cost plus fee arrangements because time and materials and fixed price contracts  as compared with cost plus fee contracts  generally provide greater opportunity for us to generate higher margins 
our acquisitions of morgan in february and techrizon in april have significantly contributed in a shift in our contract mix toward a greater percentage of time and materials contracts 
additionally  our success in winning the contract to continue providing passport processing and support services to the department of state will likely shift more of our revenue to time and materials contracts 
the following table summarizes our historical contract mix  measured as a percentage of total revenues  for the periods indicated year ended march  cost plus fee time and materials fixed price headcount and labor utilization we generate revenues primarily from services provided by our employees and subcontractors  with services provided by our employees generally yielding higher profits than services provided by our subcontractors 
our ability to hire and deploy additional qualified employees is a key driver of our ability to generate additional revenues  and our successful deployment of existing employees on direct billable jobs is a key driver of our profitability 
indirect costs indirect costs constitute a substantial portion of the costs associated with our performance of contracts for customers 
we carefully monitor the amount by which our actual indirect costs under our contracts vary from those expected to be incurred  which we refer to as indirect rate variance 
increased indirect rate variance can adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive contract pricing  our profitability  and our competitive position  by resulting in unexpected increased costs to our customers 
days sales outstanding days sales outstanding  or dso  is a measure of how efficiently we manage the billing and collection of our accounts receivable  our most significant working capital requirement 
for fiscal  we reported dso of days  an increase from the days we reported for fiscal  based on the average accounts receivable balance from the beginning of the year and at the end of each of the four quarters 
the increase in dso was primarily the result of delayed payments of significant receivables from two customers due to the restructuring of their payment processing systems 
unbilled receivables unbilled receivables are comprised of work in process that will be billed in accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules  as well as amounts billable upon final execution of contracts  contract completion  milestones or completion of rate negotiations 
because the billing of unbilled receivables is contingent on those events  changes in the relative amount of unbilled receivables have an impact on our working capital and liquidity 
payments to us for performance on certain of our federal government contracts are subject to audit by the dcaa and are subject to government funding 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from rate negotiations  audit adjustments and or government funding availability 
to the extent that actual adjustments due to rate negotiations  audit adjustments or government funding availability differ from our estimates  our revenue may be impacted 
because substantially all of our receivables originate from contracts funded by the federal government  the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account is low 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts  and actual results may differ from the estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of our management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and are the most important to our financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred and collectibility is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we use a standard management process to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which includes regular reviews of our contract performance 
this review covers  among other matters  progress against a schedule  outstanding action items  effort and staffing  quality  risks and issues  subcontract management  costs incurred  commitments and satisfaction 
during this review  we determine whether the overall progress on a contract is consistent with the effort expended 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves the use of estimates 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort and an ongoing assessment of our progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of our standard management process  facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs and revenues 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
under cost plus fee contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred and include an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the contract for level of effort contracts 
for completion type cost plus fee contracts  fixed fees are earned in proportion to the percentage of work completed 
for time and materials contracts  revenues are computed by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended in performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other billable direct and indirect costs 
for fixed price contracts  revenues are recognized as services are performed  using the percentage of completion method  applying the cost to cost or units of delivery method  in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
and american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
for cost plus award fee type contracts  we recognize the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as prior award experience and communication with the customer regarding performance  including any interim performance evaluations rendered by the customer 
for cost plus incentive fee type contracts  the method of calculating incentive fee is specified in the contract and it is typically based on measuring actual costs to perform the contract against a target cost to perform the contract 
we prepare periodic estimates to complete and adjust the incentive fee as required based on the contract incentive fee formula 
our contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on customer direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
such situations require completion of a formal internal review process and management approval prior to commencement of work 
additionally  revenue associated with such work is recognized without profit and only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on notices to proceed from our customers  previous experience with customers  communications with customers regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
pre contract costs related to unsuccessful contract bids are expensed in the period in which we are notified that the contract will not be issued 
disputes occasionally arise in the normal course of our business due to events such as delays  changes in contract specifications  and questions of cost allowability or collectibility 
such matters  whether claims or unapproved change orders in the process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred  and only when the realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
claims against us are recognized where a loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated in amount 
contract cost accounting as a contractor providing services primarily to the federal government  we must categorize our costs as either direct or indirect and allowable or unallowable 
direct costs are those costs that are identified with specific contracts 
these costs include labor  subcontractor and consultant services  third party materials we purchase under a contract and other non labor costs incurred in support of a contract 
indirect costs are those costs not identified with specific contracts 
rather  indirect costs are allocated to contracts in accordance with generally accepted cost accounting practices and federal government rules and regulations 
these costs typically include certain of our selling  general and administrative expenses  fringe benefit expenses  overhead expenses and depreciation and amortization costs 
direct and indirect costs that are not allowable under the federal acquisition regulation or specific contract provisions cannot be considered for reimbursement under our federal government contracts 
we must specifically identify these costs to ensure we comply with these requirements 
our unallowable costs include a portion of our executive compensation  interest expense  federal income tax expense  certain employee morale activities  certain types of legal and consulting costs and the amortization of identified purchased intangible assets  among others 
a key element to our historical success has been our ability to manage indirect cost growth and unallowable costs 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill 
rather  we test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis 
testing for impairment is a two step process as prescribed by sfas no 
the first step is a test for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
under the guidelines of sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment test at least on an annual basis at any time during the fiscal year  provided that the test is performed at the same time every year 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the assets fair value is below their carrying value 
based on the testing performed as of december   we determined that no impairments existed as of december  in the quarter ended march   we recorded an aggregate charge of million relating to the impairment of the cci and fsc trade names 
the impairment arose as a result of our completion of substantially all of the activities in connection with novating the contracts previously legally held by cci and fsc 
as such  we no longer ascribe any value to the cci and fsc trade names and that portion of the identified intangibles was written off as impairment of intangible assets in the year ended march  customer relationships  non competition agreements and backlog and contracts are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from one to seven years 
results of operations our historical financial statements reflect the operating results of our acquisitions from the date of acquisition 
the following tables set forth the results of operations expressed in dollars in thousands and as a percentage of revenues  for the periods below year ended march  consolidated statement of income data revenues    operating costs and expenses cost of revenues    selling  general and administrative    amortization of deferred compensation  depreciation and amortization    impairment of intangible assets  total operating costs and expenses   operating income    other income expense other income expense interest expense net    total other expenses    income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    year ended march  as a percentage of revenues revenues operating costs and expenses cost of revenues selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred compensation depreciation and amortization impairment of intangible assets total operating costs and expenses operating income other income expense other income expense interest expense net total other expenses income before taxes provision for income taxes net income we generate revenues primarily from services provided by our employees and subcontractors  with services provided by our employees generally yielding higher profits than services provided by our subcontractors 
to a lesser degree  we earn revenues through reimbursable travel and other reimbursable direct and indirect costs 
our most significant expense is cost of revenues  which includes the costs of direct labor  subcontractors  materials  equipment  travel and an allocation of indirect costs other than selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
indirect costs consist primarily of fringe benefits  applicable facility and information technology infrastructure costs  business insurance  recruiting  training  other overhead and certain other non direct costs that are necessary to support direct labor 
the number and types of personnel  their salaries and other costs  can have a significant impact on our cost of revenues 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs not directly associated with performing work for our customers 
these costs include wages plus associated fringe benefits  stock based compensation charges  rent  travel and insurance 
among the functions covered by these expenses are sales  business development  contracts  purchasing  legal  finance  accounting  human resources and benefits  information technology support and general management 
most of these costs are allowable costs under the cost accounting standards for contracting with the federal government and are recoverable under cost plus fee contracts 
our depreciation and amortization expenses include the amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions and the amortization of leasehold improvements and the depreciation of property and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of our business 
our amortization of deferred compensation includes stock based compensation amortized over the vesting period of the awards 
certain revenues and payments we receive are based on provisional billings and payments that are subject to adjustment after audit 
federal government agencies have the right to challenge our cost estimates and allocation methodologies with respect to government contracts 
in addition  contracts with these agencies are subject to audit and possible adjustment to give effect to unallowable costs under cost plus fee contracts or to other regulatory requirements affecting both cost plus fee and fixed price contracts 
comparison of results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and revenues 
our consolidated revenues increased million  or from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily due to million of increased revenue attributable to expanding demand for passport services for the department of state s bureau of consular affairs  million of increased revenue attributable to the acquisition of techrizon  million of increased revenue attributable to production and engineering services provided under various spawar programs  million of increased revenue attributable to information systems support provided to the us marine corps  including software engineering and technology services for the marine corps recruiting command  and million of increased revenue attributable to specialized engineering and technology services provided to the us army aviation and missile command  or amcom  and the us army program executive officer for simulation  training  and instrumentation  or peo stri  and million of increased revenues attributable to our immigration and nationalization services for the us citizenship and immigration services

cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of additional costs attributable to revenues generated by techrizon operations  in addition to the cost of revenues associated with the increased services provided under the contracts referred to above 
cost of revenues represented of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of start up costs associated with the ramp up of new contracts awarded during the year and fas r share based payment expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses to support expanding operations from organic and acquired growth  fas r share based payment expenses  higher recruiting costs to expand our workforce  and additional costs associated with legal  audit  tax  and sarbanes oxley compliance services 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily the result of continued realization of efficiencies in our corporate infrastructure 
amortization of deferred compensation 
our amortization of deferred compensation decreased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for fiscal year ended march  the decrease was primarily attributable to the amortization expense related to the acceleration of the vesting period of restricted stock grants in connection to our initial public offering in october depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  approximately million of the increase was related to the amortization of intangible assets primarily associated with the techrizon acquisition 
the remainder of the increase was associated with depreciation of techrizon assets and increased capital expenditures and leasehold improvements during fiscal other income or expense 
our other expense was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was primarily related to changes in market value and cancellation of our interest rate swap agreements 
our other income for the fiscal year ended march  was less than million 
interest expense  net 
our net interest expense decreased million from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net interest expense was due to the repayment of term loan borrowings and a lower overall borrowing rate 
net income 
our net income increased million or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net income was attributable to increased profits from internal revenue growth  lower interest expense and profits related to the techrizon operations 
comparison of results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and revenues 
our consolidated revenues increased million  or from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  increased revenues of million were attributable to morgan related contracts that include specialized engineering and technology services provided to amcom and peo stri 
increased revenues of million were related to continued growth providing enterprise integration and operational support services for the department of defense  expanding demand for passport services for the department of state s bureau of consular affairs  including the completion of the arkansas passport center  and ongoing logistics support for the army s equipment reset effort in the united states and abroad 
cost of revenues

the remainder of the increase was associated with depreciation of morgan assets and increased capital expenditures and leasehold improvements during fiscal impairment of intangible assets 
an impairment charge of million related to the cci and fsc trade names was recorded for the fiscal year ended march  and none was recorded for the fiscal year ended march  other income or expense 
our other income was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was primarily related to favorable changes in market value of our interest rate swap agreements 
our other expense was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was primarily related to changes in market value and cancellation of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest expense  net 
our net interest expense increased million from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net interest expense was due to the term loan borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition of morgan 
net income 
our net income increased million or  from million for the fiscal year ended march   to million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net income was attributable to increased profits from internal revenue growth and from profits related to the morgan operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business for the three years ended march  liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to finance the costs of operations pending the billing and collection of accounts receivable  to service our debt  to make capital expenditures and to make selective strategic acquisitions 
based upon our current operations  we expect that our cash flow from operations  together with amounts we are able to borrow under our amended credit agreement  will be adequate to meet our anticipated needs for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect that our cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet all contractual obligations under the amended credit agreement and our operating leases 
although we have no specific plans to do so  to the extent we decide to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we will likely need to incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance these acquisitions 
cash flow accounts receivable represents our largest working capital requirement 
we bill most of our customers monthly after services are rendered 
our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our customers in a timely manner  and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
year ended march  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily reflected our net income plus depreciation and amortization expenses for that period and a million increase in accrued expenses  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the increases in accrued expenses and accounts receivable were primarily the result of the techrizon acquisition and increased demand and volume under our existing contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal primarily reflected our net income plus depreciation and amortization expenses and amortization of deferred compensation for that period  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued expenses 
net income and increases in accounts receivable  accrued expenses and accounts payable were primarily attributable to morgan contracts and organic growth 
depreciation and amortization expenses were primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of morgan 
the amortization of deferred compensation was primarily attributable to the acceleration of the vesting period of restricted stock grants in connection with our initial public offering 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily reflected net income for that period  excluding the effects of non cash depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of assets of million and million  respectively  and an increase of million in accrued expenses  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accounts payable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risk our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively limit exposure to interest rate movements within the parameters of our interest rate hedging policy 
as of march   all of the outstanding debt under our senior credit facility  with the exception of that portion covered by an interest rate swap  was subject to floating interest rate risk 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement covering of our term indebtedness under which the swap and term debt maturities match 
even after giving effect to this agreement  we are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in the market value of this agreement and changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our senior credit facility that is not covered by this agreement 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate of basis points would have increased our annual cash interest expense on that portion of our outstanding debt not covered by the interest rate swap by million
