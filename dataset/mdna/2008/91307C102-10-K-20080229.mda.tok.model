item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for information regarding royalties and milestone payments under these agreements 
glaxosmithkline assignment in january  glaxo wellcome  inc now glaxosmithkline plc  assigned to us all rights to the use of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin 
the patent covering the use of remodulin for pah does not expire in the united states until october as extended see patent term extensions below and until various dates from september to august in nine other countries 
pfizer license in december  pharmacia upjohn company now pfizer  inc exclusively licensed to us certain patents  a patent application and know how for the composition and production of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin 
we filed our own united states patent application for a new synthesis and production method for remodulin in october  and the patent was granted in august two additional patents covering this synthesis and production method were granted in march and august we believe that our method of synthesis is a substantial improvement over the pharmacia method and we are using our unique synthesis method rather than the licensed pharmacia method for the production of remodulin 
we have also registered two patents and have one pending patent application with respect to additional remodulin synthesis improvements 
stanford university and new york medical college licenses in  we acquired the exclusive license to patents from stanford university and new york medical college related to arginine based dietary supplements that work to enhance the level of naturally occurring nitric oxide in the vascular system 
the licenses cover worldwide territories and are valid for the life of the patents expiration dates ranging from to 
we will own all rights to any new products derived from these licenses 
supernus pharmaceutical license in june  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with supernus to use certain technologies developed by them in our sustained release oral treprostinil formulation 
under the agreement  in return for the license  we will pay supernus certain amounts upon the achievement of specified milestones based on the development of oral treprostinil and its commercial launch 
in addition  the agreement provides that we will pay a royalty to supernus based on net worldwide sales of the initial product 
any such royalty will be paid for approximately twelve years commencing with the first product sale and is subject to adjustments as specified in the agreement 
additional milestone payments and royalty payments may be due for the development and commercialization of other products developed using the technology granted in this license 
transmit license in march  transmit gesellschaft fur technologletransfer gmbh 
transmit  an affiliate of the university of giessen  assigned to lung rx its entire interest in the patent rights to a portable ultrasonic nebulizer and related technology in order to make  have made  use and sell products based on such patent rights 
as consideration for the assignment  lung rx paid to transmit approximately  and agreed to pay a running royalty on net sales of nebulizers using the technology in germany 
however  no royalty payments are due to transmit until royalties on net sales of products in germany exceed the original payment of approximately memorial sloan kettering in december  we entered into two agreements with memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc to exclusively license certain rights to two investigational monoclonal antibodies  f and h  for the treatment of neuroblastoma and metastatic brain cancer 
the monoclonal antibody f is a mouse igg mab  which is currently used in an investigational setting for the treatment of neuroblastoma  a rare cancer of the sympathetic nervous system mainly affecting children 
h is also a mouse monoclonal antibody  but of the igg subclass 
the h antibody is highly reactive with a range of human solid tumors  including brain cancers 
the h antibody is in early investigational development for metastatic brain cancer 
under the terms of the licensing agreements  mskcc granted us an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of the f and h antibodies for cancer throughout the universe 
in exchange for these exclusive licenses  we agreed to pay a royalty fee on net sales  with an annual minimum royalty payment for each antibody 
milestone payments may also be due for the development and commercialization of these antibodies under our licenses 
patent term extensions in february  we were granted a five year patent term extension by the united states patent and trademark office for a patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
us patent number  entitled method of treating pulmonary hypertension with benzidine prostaglandins  was originally scheduled to expire on october  it will now expire on october  the five year hatch waxman act extension is the maximum extension allowed under usc additional patents covering other products to which we have rights may also be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures under the hatch waxman act in the united states  and under similar procedures in europe 
research development expenditures we are engaged in research and development and have incurred substantial expenses for these activities 
these expenses generally include the cost of acquiring or inventing new technologies and products as well as their development 
research and development expenses during  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations major research and development projects for additional information regarding expenditures related to major research and development projects 
manufacturing and supply we made treprostinil  the active ingredient for remodulin and inhaled treprostinil  and treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  at our manufacturing facility in chicago  illinois  until march at which time we transitioned these activities to our new laboratory in silver spring  maryland 
the validation process for making these treprostinil based compounds in the silver spring facility commenced in october we anticipate filing with the fda and other regulatory agencies for approval to use the new facility for commercial purposes in the first quarter of  with regulatory agency approvals expected in the latter half of until fda approval  we cannot commercially use any products manufactured in the silver spring facility 
we currently maintain an inventory of formulated remodulin that will meet over two years of expected demand 
with the transfer of our manufacturing operations to the silver spring  maryland  facility  we have also changed our internal manufacturing process 
when we began  we produced treprostinil starting with basic chemicals and completed the full manufacturing process 
over the last two years  we have been modifying the process to begin treprostinil manufacturing with advanced intermediate compounds made by outside vendors 
we anticipate that upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  the need for treprostinil diethanolamine will be greater than the need for treprostinil sodium used for the inhaled and infusion therapies 
as a result  the manufacturing process will consist of starting with the advanced intermediate compound  making treprostinil diethanolamine and then converting that compound to treprostinil sodium as needed 
we expect this to allow us the most flexibility and efficiency in meeting future demands for both forms of active ingredients 
we have approved three vendors to supply the advanced intermediate compounds in order to reduce the risk of supply shortages 
baxter healthcare corporation formulates remodulin from treprostinil for us 
the term of our initial agreement with baxter ended in october the contract is renewable for successive eighteen month terms and has been renewed 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc formerly  cardinal health  inc  for conducting stability studies on remodulin  formulating inhaled treprostinil  formulating oral treprostinil for clinical trials  and analyzing other products we are developing 
in  we anticipate commencing commercial development of the f and h antibodies licensed from mskcc at our silver spring  maryland  facility 
we expect to be able to use the same equipment for f and h development as we used for the ovarex process 
our telemedicine products are currently manufactured by msi of florida 
in  we anticipate moving the manufacturing of our telemedicine products to winland electronics  inc  due to an increase in the volume of devices needed to meet patient demand 
although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we have limited experience with production and manufacturing products 
competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan has been marketed by glaxosmithkline plc since in the second quarter of  myogen  inc acquired the marketing rights for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april  so it is possible that generic formulations of flolan could become available for commercial sale 
ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is the only prostacyclin analog that has been approved for inhalation 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc  cotherix in the united states and schering ag in europe 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion ltd  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer 
tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class  known as endothelin receptor antagonists 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed by actelion ltd worldwide 
revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer inc revatio is a different formulation of the very successful drug viagra and is the first drug in its class  known as pde inhibitors  to be approved for pah 
letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy  and is marketed by gilead sciences  inc in the united states for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an endothelin receptor antagonist 
glaxosmithkline is seeking approval of letairis in europe where it is known as volibris 
in february  glaxosmithkline announced that volibris received a positive opinion for approval in the european union 
thelin 
approved in august in the european union  thelin is an oral therapy  and is marketed by encysive pharmaceuticals inc encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an endothelin receptor antagonist 
in february  pfizer inc announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire encysive 
thelin is not approved in the united states 
due to their ease of use  oral therapies  such as tracleer and revatio  are generally considered front line therapies for newly diagnosed patients 
flolan and remodulin  more complex infusion therapies  are generally considered later stage therapies for sicker patients 
the use of the available oral therapies and ventavis  either alone or in combination  will delay the need for infusion therapy for many patients 
as a result  while we may not currently compete head to head with these drugs as front line therapy  the success of their use affects our commercial operations 
as we develop both inhaled and oral treprostinil therapies  we will be expanding our range of therapeutics to front line treatment 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we may not successfully compete with established drugs and the companies that develop and market them 
holter and event monitoring analysis services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
we compete with all of these companies for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we have 
governmental regulation the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda review and approval of the new drug application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application 
a day waiting period after the filing of each investigational new drug application is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until it authorizes trials under specified terms 
the investigational new drug application process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials to support new drug applications are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically diverse clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  a new drug application nda or a biologics license application both referred to as an application is typically submitted 
the fda may request additional information before accepting an application for filing  in which case the application must be resubmitted with the additional information 
once the submission has been accepted for filing  the fda reviews the application and responds to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether it should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
the fda may also inspect the manufacturing facility before approving an application 
if fda evaluations of the application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter 
an approvable letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda also may refuse to approve the application and issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
at the request of an applicant  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
if an applicant obtains the first fda marketing approval for a certain orphan drug  the applicant will have a seven year exclusive right as against generic versions to market the drug for the orphan indication 
the fda has approved the orphan designation for treprostinil for the treatment of pah without regard to drug product formulation 
we believe that the orphan designation of treprostinil includes all types of pah  regardless of etiology 
however  such designation does not preclude us from seeking orphan drug designation for other formulations of treprostinil or for other etiologies of pah or medically plausible subsets of pah  and does not preclude the fda from granting a new seven year period of orphan drug exclusivity upon the approval of an nda for a new formulation of treprostinil for the designated new indication  provided we demonstrate that such new formulation is clinically superior to the older formulation of parenteral remodulin 
subcutaneous remodulin was approved by the fda for the treatment of pah in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise  and intravenous remodulin was approved for those patients not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
if regulatory approval of our other products is granted  such approvals will similarly be limited to certain disease states or conditions 
the manufacturers of approved products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
furthermore  identification of certain side effects or the occurrence of manufacturing problems after a drug is on the market could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  and changes in labeling of the product 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for the product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an investigational application and the submission date of an application  plus all of the time between the submission date of an application and the approval of that application  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin following fda approval 
the application was approved in february  and the patent now expires on october  outside of the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although  within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union eu member state 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and high technology products and is available at the applicant s option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member states 
the decentralized procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member states  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all member states for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in a member state  the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
to secure european regulatory approvals for subcutaneous use of remodulin for pah  we used the mutual recognition procedure 
under the rules then applicable  centralized filing was not required and we perceived the decentralized procedure to be the most effective means for approval 
we filed our first marketing authorization application in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of resubmitting the applications when we file for approval for intravenous remodulin since these countries required additional information not required by the other european countries 
we have to file for approval for intravenous use of remodulin using the mutual recognition process since intravenous use of remodulin is considered a variation to the original license 
we have filed our application with our reference member state  france  which has notified us that it is not satisfied with the filing we have made 
we will work to address these concerns and believe that we will eventually receive commercial approval for intravenous remodulin in at least some european countries 
we have regulatory applications pending in other countries as well 
to secure european regulatory approval for inhaled treprostinil  we will use the centralized process 
regulations in europe have changed since we made our initial filing for remodulin and all therapies for orphan diseases must use the centralized process 
we plan on filing for european approval of inhaled treprostinil in late to secure approval of the optineb device in the united states  applicable regulations require a quality system for the design  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  installation and servicing of devices intended for commercial distribution 
these quality system regulations require that various specifications and controls be established for devices  devices be designed under a quality system to meet these specifications  devices be manufactured under a quality system  finished devices meet these specifications  devices be correctly installed  checked and serviced  quality data be analyzed to identify and correct quality problems  and complaints be processed 
regulatory authorities may also require additional patient data to support approval for these devices 
we are also subject to inspections by regulatory agencies and ensuring that we and nebu tec meet all requirements during inspections 
to continue marketing our products after approval  applicable regulations require us to maintain a positive benefit risk profile  maintaining regulatory applications through periodic reports to regulatory authorities  fulfilling pharmacovigilance requirements  maintaining manufacturing facilities to good manufacturing practices requirements  and successfully completing regulatory agency inspections  among other requirements 
telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that are regulated by the fda under different laws and regulations that apply to medical devices 
the telemedicine devices designed and sold by medicomp have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
medical devices are required to be manufactured in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations 
in the united states  reimbursements are provided for remodulin by many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare is the federal program which provides health care benefits to certain senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons  and medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for remodulin at a rate generally equal to of the published average wholesale price  as recommended by us 
the state medicaid programs generally provide reimbursement for remodulin at a price that is below the published average wholesale price 
beginning in  the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
we anticipate that the new rules will not have an impact on remodulin reimbursement rates in in return for including remodulin in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for remodulin 
we have also agreed to sell remodulin under contracts with the veterans administration  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b entities entities designated by federal programs to receive discounted drug prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our distributors 
these programs and contracts impose many regulations and restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for remodulin 
we estimate that between of remodulin sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 
employees we had approximately employees as of february  we also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals  most of whom have month to month or annual consulting contracts 
we believe our employee relations are excellent

risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable although we have been profitable for each calendar year since  we have had quarters in which we experienced a loss 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
although we set our annual operating budgets to be less than our estimated revenues  numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  could affect consolidated revenues and profitability and cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin to produce revenues 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin 
during the year ended december   our remodulin sales accounted for of our total revenues 
a wide variety of events  many of which are described in other risk factors below  could cause remodulin sales to decline 
for example  if regulatory approvals for remodulin are withdrawn  we will be unable to sell that product and our revenues will suffer 
in the event that glaxosmithkline terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer terminates its license agreement  we will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
glaxosmithkline or pfizer could seek to terminate the assignment or license  respectively  in the event that we fail to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin 
in addition  we rely on third parties to produce  market  distribute and sell remodulin 
the loss of third parties to perform these functions  or the failure of these parties to do so successfully  also could cause our revenues to suffer 
because we are so dependent on sales of remodulin  any reduction in the sale of remodulin would cause our results of operations to suffer 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical development and may never generate profits 
our only pharmaceutical product currently in commercial distribution is remodulin 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies  therefore  many of those products may not be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
we might not maintain or obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell our pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if we sell our products  we may not be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability we achieve 
we may not successfully compete with established drugs  products and the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients  and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies following approval of our products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters than we do 
we are aware of existing treatments that compete with our products  especially in the field of pah 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products to be safer  more effective  more convenient or less expensive than remodulin 
accordingly  sales of remodulin may not increase  or may even decrease if doctors prescribe less remodulin than they are prescribing at present 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan has been marketed by glaxosmithkline plc since in the second quarter of  myogen  inc myogen  acquired the marketing rights for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc  which is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company in the united states 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april  so it is possible that generic formulations of flolan could become available for commercial sale 
flolan is delivered by intravenous infusion and considered to be an effective treatment by most pah experts 
ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is the only prostacyclin analog that has been approved for inhalation  whereas remodulin is only currently approved to be delivered through intravenous or subcutaneous infusion 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc cotherix  in the united states and schering ag in europe 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion ltd  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer 
actelion is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company 
tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class  known as endothelin receptor antagonists 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed by actelion worldwide 
revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer inc pfizer 
revatio is a different formulation of the very successful drug viagra and is the first drug in its class  known as pde inhibitors  to be approved for pah 
pfizer is regarded as a large and successful pharmaceutical company in the united states 
letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy  and is marketed by gilead sciences  inc in the united states for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an endothelin receptor antagonist 
glaxosmithkline is seeking approval of letairis in europe where it is known as volibris 
in february  glaxosmithkline announced that volibris received a positive opinion for approval in the european union 
thelin 
approved in august in the european union  thelin is an oral therapy  and is marketed by encysive pharmaceuticals inc encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an endothelin receptor antagonist 
in february  pfizer announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire encysive 
doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients if they prescribe our competitors products in combination with remodulin 
in addition  certain of our competitors products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
finally  as a result of actelion s acquisition of cotherix  gilead s acquisition of myogen  and pfizer s pending acquisition of encysive  each of these three companies now controls two of the seven approved therapies for pah in the united states  the seventh of which is remodulin 
in addition to reducing competition through consolidation  each company brings considerable influence over prescribers to the sales and marketing of their respective two approved therapies through market dominance in this therapeutic area 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for the hepatitis c virus and cancer that will compete with any products we may develop from our glycobiology antiviral agents and monoclonal antibodies platforms 
many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors provide cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems that compete with our telemedicine products 
discoveries or development of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
companies may make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies that treat the diseases for which our products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with or as a substitute for remodulin 
if this happens  doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients or may prescribe other treatments instead of remodulin 
this could result in less remodulin being used by patients and  hence  reduced sales of remodulin 
remodulin and our other treprostinil based products may have to compete with investigational products currently being developed by other companies  including thelin 
thelin is currently being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc encysive  worldwide for the treatment of pah 
although encysive has received marketing authorization in all nations in the european union  they have not received fda approval in the united states 
in february  pfizer announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire encysive and that it intended to conduct an additional clinical trial in order to file for fda approval  cialis 
an approved oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  cialis is currently marketed by eli lilly and company lilly 
prior to january  cialis was jointly marketed by icos corporation and lilly 
cialis is currently being studied in patients with pah  and is in the same class of drugs as revatio 
in january  icos corporation was acquired by lilly  which is a large and successful pharmaceutical company in the united states  gleevec an approved oral treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia a cancer of the blood and bone marrow  gleevec is currently marketed by novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
recently  experienced pah researchers have conducted studies with gleevec and believe that it may be effective in treating pah  aviptadil 
an inhaled formulation of a vasoactive intestinal peptide  aviptadil is being developed by mondobiotech holding sa for the treatment of pah 
in september  mondobiotech announced that it had outlicensed aviptadil for the treatment of pah to biogen idec inc  which is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company in the united states  prx a serotonin receptor htb antagonist  prx is being developed by predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc  as an oral tablet for the treatment of pah 
two phase i clinical trials of prx are being conducted in healthy volunteers  pulmolar 
currently in development by pr pharmaceuticals  inc  pulmolar is a once a month injectible therapy which contains a metabolite of estradiol and has been shown in animal and cell models to address certain processes associated with pah  fasudil 
oral and inhaled formulations of fasudil  a rho kinase inhibitor  may be developed by actelion ltd for the treatment of pah 
fasudil is currently approved in japan as an intravenous drug to treat a disease unrelated to pah  sorafenib 
originally marketed by bayer ag as nexavar for advanced renal cell cancer  sorafenib is a small molecule that inhibits raf kinase and that may interfere with the thickening of blood vessel walls associated with pah 
a phase i clinical trial in pah has been proposed  recombinant elafin 
currently being developed by proteo biotech ag  recombinant elafin is a synthetic version of a protein that is produced naturally in the body and may inhibit inflammatory reactions 
in february  elafin was granted orphan product status in the european union for the treatment of pah and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension  cicletanine 
marketed by navitas pharma for hypertension in europe  cicletatnine is an enos coupler that works to increase the flexibility of blood vessel linings  and r bh a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor that is required for numerous biochemical and physiologic processes  including the synthesis of nitric oxide  r bh is being developed by biomarin pharmaceutical inc for the treatment of poorly controlled hypertension  peripheral arterial disease and phenylketonuria 
a phase i clinical trial of r bh for pah is also underway 
there may be additional drugs in development for pah in addition to those listed above and there may also be currently approved drugs that prove effective in treating the disease 
if any of these drugs in development  additional new drugs or other currently approved drugs are used to treat pah  sales of remodulin may fall 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for our drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  our sales will suffer 
our commercial success depends heavily on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
these third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs  and it may be difficult for distributors selling remodulin to obtain reimbursement from these payers 
remodulin and the associated infusion pumps and supplies are very expensive 
we believe our investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
in the past  medicare has not reimbursed the full cost of the therapy for some patients 
beginning on january   the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms negotiate a new price for remodulin 
as the result of the staggered implementation of this act  remodulin has not yet been subject to the pricing provisions 
in addition  to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow any medicaid and medicare coverage and payment developments  the adverse effects of lower medicare payment rates may be expanded by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules 
additionally  some states have enacted health care reform legislation 
further federal and state developments are possible 
third party payers may not approve our new products for reimbursement or may not continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement  or may seek to reduce the amount of reimbursement for remodulin based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including possible generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan  which may currently be sold in generic form 
if third party payers do not approve a product of ours for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients could opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
the growth of our cardiac monitoring business is dependent upon physicians utilizing our services  if we fail to maintain our current level of physician utilization  our cardiac monitoring revenues may stagnate and our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to provide our cardiac monitoring services is dependent upon physicians prescribing our diagnostic tests to their patients 
our success in obtaining patients to monitor will be directly influenced by the relationships we develop and maintain with physicians and physician groups in a manner consistent with government regulations affecting such relationships 
if we are unable to maintain such relationships and create new relationships in compliance with applicable laws  the number of patients using our cardiac monitoring services will decline  which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to educate physicians regarding the benefits of our cardiopal savi system and achieve sufficient levels of utilization  revenues from the provision of our cardiac monitoring services could fail to grow and could decrease 
reimbursement for cardiac monitoring services by medicare is highly regulated and subject to change and the operation of our call centers and monitoring facilities is subject to rules and regulations governing independent diagnostic testing facilities  failure to comply with these rules could prevent us from receiving reimbursement for our cardiac services from medicare and some commercial payers 
we receive approximately of our cardiac monitoring service revenues as reimbursement from medicare 
reimbursement from medicare for cardiac monitoring services is subject to statutory and regulatory changes  rate adjustments and administrative rulings  all of which could materially affect the range of services covered or the reimbursement rates paid by medicare for use of our cardiac monitoring services 
in  cms adopted a change in methodology for calculating reimbursement under the physician fee schedule that will be implemented over a year period 
this resulted in reduced reimbursement for our cardiac monitoring services from medicare by to  depending on the type of service 
similar reductions have been adopted for and are expected annually through in addition  we cannot predict whether future modifications to medicare s reimbursement policies could reduce the amounts we receive from medicare for the services we provide 
finally  medicare s reimbursement rates can affect the rate that commercial payers are willing to pay for our products and services 
the medicare program is administered by cms  which imposes extensive and detailed requirements on medical services providers  including  but not limited to  rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians  how and when we submit reimbursement claims  how we operate our monitoring facilities and how we provide our cardiac monitors and monitoring services 
our failure to comply with applicable medicare rules could result in medicare discontinuing our reimbursement  our being required to return funds already paid to us  civil monetary penalties  criminal penalties and or exclusion from the medicare program 
furthermore  in order for us to receive reimbursement for cardiac monitoring services from medicare and some commercial payers  we must have a call center certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility  or idtf 
certification as an idtf requires that we follow strict regulations governing how the center operates  such as requirements regarding the experience and certifications of the technicians who review data transmitted from our cardiac monitors 
these rules and regulations vary from location to location and are subject to change 
if they change  we may have to change the operating procedures at our monitoring facilities  which could increase our costs significantly 
if we fail to obtain and maintain idtf certification  our services may no longer be reimbursed by medicare and some commercial payers  which could materially affect our telemedicine business adversely 
we rely on third parties to market  distribute and sell most of our products and those third parties may not perform 
we are currently marketing products in two of our four therapeutic platforms remodulin in our prostacyclin analog platform and cardiopal savi cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in our telemedicine platform 
we also have several products in the clinical trial stage 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of our products and intend to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform some or all of those functions 
we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might not be able to develop  market  distribute or sell our products and our future revenues could suffer 
we rely on accredo therapeutics  inc  curascript  inc 
and caremark  inc to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
accredo  curascript and caremark are also responsible for convincing third party payers to reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin  which is very expensive 
if our distribution partners and contractors do not achieve acceptable profit margins  they may not continue to distribute our products 
if our distribution partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  our revenues will suffer 
since the commercial launch of remodulin  all of our remodulin distributors in the united states have been sold to larger companies 
when these distributors were independently managed  the remodulin franchise was a more significant business to them  because they were much smaller 
as divisions or subsidiaries of much larger companies  remodulin could be much less significant to these distributors 
there can be no assurance that the mergers experienced by each of our distributors will not adversely affect remodulin distribution 
in addition  effective january   accredo became the exclusive us distributor for flolan 
it is possible that our distributors may devote fewer resources to the distribution of remodulin 
if so  this may negatively impact our sales 
our operations depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulations 
failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products 
the products that we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and  once approved  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals we receive in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
potential products may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis  or at all 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements  including those relating to misleading advertising or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
in addition  our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive continued regulation and review 
we received one warning letter from the fda related to advertising in  which was resolved satisfactorily 
in early august  three european union countries requested that we perform repeat sterility testing of remodulin vials sold in the european union 
france was our sponsoring country for european union approval  and we had been operating under an understanding with french regulatory authorities that additional sterility testing was not necessary since these tests were already performed in the united states and meet both united states and european union regulatory requirements 
our ability to add new patients in those countries depended on our validating and repeating the sterility testing process in the european union 
we arranged for repeat sterility testing of remodulin vials for use in the european union and worked with appropriate regulatory agencies and our distributors to ensure that there was no disruption of remodulin therapy during the repeat testing period 
all remodulin patients in the three countries remained on therapy throughout the testing process 
we completed this process in september we have received regulatory clearance from all countries 
we have never experienced a sterility related or other product specification failure with respect to our remodulin vials 
however  discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  promotional or other commercialization activities may result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of the products from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we could be subject to penalties including fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 
if approvals are withdrawn for remodulin or any other product  we will not be able to sell that product and our revenues will suffer 
in addition  if product approvals are withdrawn  governmental authorities could seize our products or force us to recall our products 
reports of side effects  such as sepsis  associated with intravenous remodulin could cause physicians and patients to not accept remodulin or to cease to use remodulin in favor of alternative treatments 
sepsis is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins are infused continuously through a catheter placed in patients chests  and sepsis is an expected consequence of this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
the flolan package insert specifically documents the risk rate of sepsis at events per patient per year  meaning one patient out of every three taking the drug is expected to have a sepsis infection each year 
or  each patient on flolan is expected to have one sepsis infection every three years 
the remodulin package insert notes that two out of patients experienced catheter related infections in an open label week study  but does not provide any data relating to expected risk rate 
historical data on intravenous prostacyclin administration does not identify the specific types of bacteria responsible for these infections 
in february  the scientific leadership committee slc of the pulmonary hypertension association announced new guidance relating to the treatment of pah patients on long term intravenous therapy 
the slc guidance was issued in response to the release of a slide presentation prepared by researchers with the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc entitled bloodstream infections among patients treated with intravenous epoprostenol and intravenous treprostinil for pulmonary arterial hypertension  united states these slides accompanied a presentation to the slc and were subsequently published as a report in the cdc s morbidity and mortality weekly report on march  the slides and report were prepared in connection with a cdc retrospective inquiry at seven centers regarding a report of increased bloodstream infections  particularly gram negative blood stream infections  among pah patients treated with intravenous remodulin as compared to intravenous flolan 
the slc guidance statement noted that the cdc observations were hypothesis generating and did not permit definitive or specific conclusions 
the slc reminded physicians of the need to be aware of the range of possible gram negative and gram positive infectious organisms in patients with long term central catheters and to treat them appropriately 
we have been informed that the slc is planning a study to evaluate the risk of sepsis and sepsis sub types among parenterally delivered prostanoids 
finally  the fda revised the remodulin package insert in february to more fully describe the known infection risk and appropriate techniques to be practiced when preparing and administering remodulin intravenously 
although the risk of sepsis is currently included in the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who treat pah patients  concern about bloodstream infections may adversely affect physicians prescribing practices in regard to remodulin 
if that occurs  remodulin sales could suffer and our profitability could be diminished 
we have transitioned our manufacturing operations to a new location 
we are in the process of validating treprostinil manufacturing in our new silver spring  maryland  laboratory 
this manufacturing process will be done on a larger scale than that performed in our former chicago  illinois  facility 
we closed the chicago facility in may until we have received fda and international approvals for the silver spring laboratory  we cannot sell products made with compounds produced there 
in addition  commercial treprostinil is being manufactured only by us with reliance on third parties for certain raw and advanced intermediate materials 
we depend on third parties to formulate and manufacture our products and related devices 
we rely on third parties to formulate our treprostinil based products 
we rely on baxter healthcare corporation for the formulation of remodulin from treprostinil 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc for conducting stability studies on remodulin  formulating treprostinil for inhalation use  formulating tablets for our oral clinical trials  and analyzing other products that we are developing 
we also rely on third parties for the manufacture of all our products other than treprostinil 
we rely on msi of central florida  inc to manufacture our telemedicine devices 
we rely on other manufacturers to make our investigational drugs and devices for use in clinical trials 
we also rely on nebu tec  a german company  to manufacture the optineb nebulizer used with inhaled treprostinil 
nebu tec is responsible for managing and controlling the manufacturing process of its device  all associated parts  and work performed by its suppliers  in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
because regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil will be linked to regulatory approval of the optineb device  any regulatory compliance problems encountered by nebu tec with respect to the manufacture of its device could delay or otherwise adversely affect regulatory approvals of inhaled treprostinil  and our revenues could suffer 
in addition  following regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil  any inability of nebu tec to manufacture a sufficient quantity of nebulizers to meet patient demand could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth 
although there are few companies that could replace each of these suppliers  we believe that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect our research and development efforts and future sales efforts 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of our products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and process validation could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture treprostinil and remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products are subject to the fda s and international drug regulatory authorities good manufacturing practices regulations and similar international standards  and although we control compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our third party manufacturers  even if we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products comply with the fda s and international drug regulatory authorities good manufacturing practices regulations and similar international standards  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured and formulated could be deficient 
if this occurred  such products would not be available for sale or use  if we have to change to another manufacturing or formulation contractor for any reason or abandon our own manufacturing operations  the fda and international drug regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections  and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the validation and production of the affected product 
cardinal health recently sold its formulation business to catalent pharma solutions  inc and there can be no assurances that they will continue formulating treprostinil for both our inhalation and oral clinical trials  we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and may have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  the supply of raw and advanced intermediate materials and components used in the manufacture and packaging of treprostinil  remodulin and other products may become scarce or be interrupted  which could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any proposed substitute materials and components are subject to approval by the fda and international drug regulators before any manufactured product can be sold 
the timing of such fda and international drug regulatory approval is difficult to predict and approvals may not be timely obtained  and we may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many of the improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for our new products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs  and result in our inability to effectively sell our products 
until november  medtronic minimed was our exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pah 
medtronic has discontinued making infusion pumps for subcutaneous delivery of remodulin after first giving us and our distributors the opportunity to purchase desired quantities 
in november  we mutually agreed with minimed to terminate our contract 
we relied on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance in supplying the infusion pumps 
any disruption in the supply to pah patients of infusion devices could delay or prevent patients from initiating or continuing remodulin therapy  which could adversely affect our revenues 
doctors and patients may not be able to obtain acceptable substitute delivery devices to replace the minimed microinfusion devises when the available supply held by our distributors has been depleted 
if our products fail in clinical studies  we will not be able to obtain or maintain fda and international approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell our pharmaceutical products  we must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  we must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug product  including its delivery mechanism  is safe and effective 
if we cannot obtain approval from the fda and international drug regulators for a product  that product cannot be sold  and our revenues will suffer 
in november we announced we are conducting phase iii clinical studies of an oral formulation of treprostinil and are working on submission to the fda for our completed phase iii study of inhaled treprostinil 
our glycobiology antiviral agent  ut b as monotherapy  completed a phase ii  proof of concept study in late in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy as a monotherapy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now conducting preclinical testing of additional glycobiology drug candidates and we are exploring opportunities to accelerate our glycobiology clinical development efforts 
we are still completing or planning pre clinical studies for our other products 
in the past  several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process  including  but not limited to ovarex mab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer  immediate release beraprost for early stage peripheral vascular disease  ketotop for osteoarthritis of the knee  and ut for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
our ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and international regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
the fda and international regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated that our products are safe and effective 
finally  because regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil will be linked to regulatory approval of the optineb nebulizer  any regulatory compliance problems encountered by nebu tec with respect to the manufacture of its device could delay or otherwise adversely affect regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
while we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs  we cannot ensure that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  or other sanctions or litigation 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we would lose our right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin and all of the other products in the prostacyclin platform  all of the products in the glycobiology antiviral agents platform  and all of the products in our monoclonal antibodies platform 
under our product license agreements  we are granted certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by third parties subject to the terms of each license agreement  whereas assignment agreements transfer all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each assignment agreement 
we have also obtained licenses to other third party technology to conduct our business 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence has the following risks we may not be able to obtain future licenses  assignments and agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignments are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market the products covered by such licenses or assignments  the licenses and assignments that we hold generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event we breach the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
certain license and assignment agreements relating to our products may restrict our ability to develop products in certain countries and or for particular diseases and impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we acquire  license or receive assignments of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  we may receive rights only to develop such drugs or products in certain territories and not throughout the world 
for example  we only have the rights to market beraprost mr for sale in north america and europe 
in addition  provisions in our license and assignment agreements impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
for example  in assigning remodulin to us  glaxosmithkline retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we ever decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin anywhere in the world 
similarly  in connection with toray s license of beraprost mr to us  we agreed to provisions establishing a conditional  restricted non competition clause in toray s favor  giving them the right to be our exclusive provider of beraprost mr and requiring that we make certain minimum annual sales in order to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost mr 
the restrictions that we have accepted in our license and assignment agreements affect our freedom to develop and market our products in the future 
if our or our suppliers patent and other intellectual property protection are inadequate  our sales and profits could suffer or our competitors could force our products completely out of the market 
our united states patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin is currently set to expire in october and the patent for inhaled treprostinil is set to expire in we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures in europe and under the hatch waxman act in the united states 
our patent for treating pah with remodulin has already received the maximum five year extension 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as our products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around or seek to invalidate our existing patents before they expire 
if this happens  our sales would suffer and our profits could be severely impacted 
in addition  if our suppliers intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
we have been granted patents in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but patent applications that have been or may be filed by us may not result in the issuance of additional patents 
the scope of any patent issued may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
the laws of international jurisdictions in which we intend to sell our products may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting our proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to our know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for us 
while we have recently settled pending litigation against two parties related to enforcing our arginine patents  we may in the future choose to initiate litigation against other parties who we come to believe have violated our patents or other proprietary rights 
if such litigation is unsuccessful or if the patents are invalidated or canceled  we may have to write off the related intangible assets which could significantly reduce our earnings 
any of our licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to us 
patents may be issued to others that prevent the manufacture or sale of our products 
we may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing our products 
this would cause profits to suffer 
to the extent valid third party patent rights cover our products or services  we or our strategic collaborators would be required to seek licenses from the holders of these patents in order to manufacture  use  or sell our products and services 
payments under these licenses would reduce our profits from these products and services 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of our technology to fall outside the scope of a third party patent  we may be unable to market some of our products and services  which would limit our profitability 
proposed changes to united states patent law are currently pending in congress 
if these proposed patent reforms become law  it could make it easier for patents to be invalidated and or could reduce the amount of damages in cases of patent infringement 
because we rely on patents to protect our products  the proposed patent reform could have an adverse impact on our business 
pursuant to our agreements with certain business partners  any new inventions or intellectual properties that arise from our activities will be owned jointly by us and these partners 
if we do not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or we have to share the rights with others  we may lose some or all of the benefit of these new rights  which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
if we infringe the patents of others  we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties 
we may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or acquire a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain such licenses or alternative technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products 
if our highly qualified management and technical personnel leave us  our business may suffer 
we are dependent on our current management  particularly our founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  our president and chief operating officer  roger jeffs  phd  our chief financial officer and treasurer  john ferrari  our executive vice president for strategic planning and general counsel  paul mahon  our senior vice president for pharmaceutical development  david zaccardelli  pharmd  our senior vice president for regulatory affairs  dean bunce  and our senior vice president for biologics production  development and supply  james levin  dvm 
while these individuals are employed by us pursuant to multi year employment agreements  employment agreements do not ensure the continued retention of employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on these officers  although we do incentivize them to remain employed by us until at least age through our supplemental executive retirement plan 
our success will depend in part on retaining the services of our existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
few individuals possess expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
we may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks 
although we currently have product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate for our products  we may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
we may need to spend more money than currently expected because we may need to change our product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  to prepare for commercial sales or to continue sales of remodulin 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
at least a portion of the repayment of our convertible senior notes due convertible notes will be required to be made in cash 
our product development plans and product offerings could be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient financial resources  or are not able to arrange suitable financing  to pay required amounts upon conversion or tender of the notes and fund our operations 
our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous materials and we are expanding these activities to new locations 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs in order to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations  and substantial fines and penalties for failure to comply with those laws and regulations 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with laws and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
furthermore  once these materials leave our site  we cannot control what our hazardous waste removal contractors choose to do with them 
in the event of an accident or we could be liable for civil damages that result or for costs associated with the cleanup of any release of hazardous materials  which could be substantial 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth 
several risks are inherent to our plans to grow our business 
achieving our goals will require substantial investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
for example  we have spent considerable resources building and seeking regulatory approvals for our laboratories and manufacturing facilities 
these facilities may not prove sufficient to meet demand for our products or we may have excess capacity at these facilities 
in addition  building our facilities is expensive  and our ability to recover these costs will depend on increased revenue from the products produced at the facilities 
if we are able to grow sales of our products  we may have difficulty managing inventory levels 
marketing new therapies is a complicated process  and gauging future demand is difficult 
growth in our business may also contribute to fluctuations in our operating results  which may cause the price of our securities to decline 
our financial results may be impacted by future accounting rules 
our future  as well as our previously published financial results could be affected by new accounting rules 
the fasb recently proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp a 
the proposed fsp specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instrument s issuance date when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
our convertible notes are within the scope of fsp a  therefore  we would be required to record the debt portions of our convertible notes at their fair value on the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount into interest expense over the life of the debt 
however  there would be no effect on our cash interest payments 
as currently proposed  fsp a will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
if adopted as proposed  these changes would be reflected in our financial statements beginning with the first quarter of we believe that the change  if adopted as proposed  could have a significant impact in the future on our results of operations 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  the price of our common stock could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our projections  the pace of enrollment in and the results of clinical trials  physician  patient  investor or public concerns as to the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of remodulin by medicare or medicaid and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  disagreements with our licensors and vendors  future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders  future sales of our common stock by our directors and officers  rumors among investors and or analysts concerning the company  its products or operations  failure to maintain  or changes to  our approvals to sell remodulin  failure to successfully obtain fda approval for our new silver spring  maryland  remodulin and monoclonal antibody laboratory  the accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  timing and outcome of additional regulatory submissions and approvals  and general market conditions 
we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenue or profits 
many independent securities analysts have published quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
these projections were made independently by the securities analysts based on their own analysis 
such estimates are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty  particularly because we do not generally provide forward looking guidance to the public 
as a result  the actual revenues and net income may be greater or less than projected by such securities analysts 
even small variations in reported revenues and profits as compared to securities analysts expectations can lead to significant changes in our stock price 
future sales of shares of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if we issue common stock to raise capital  or our stockholders transfer their ownership of our common stock or sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of our common stock could decrease 
all of our executive officers have announced their adoption of b prearranged trading plans 
in accordance with these plans  these executives periodically sell a specified number of our shares of our common stock either owned by them or acquired through the exercise of stock options 
however  our executives and directors may choose to sell additional shares outside of b trading plans and two executive officers and six directors have done so 
a decrease in our common stock price could make it difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
furthermore  the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes after the price of our common stock reached per share dilutes the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
we have filed a resale registration statement covering sales of such shares 
the convertible notes initially are convertible into an aggregate million shares of our common stock 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could depress the price of our common stock 
the fundamental change purchase feature of the convertible notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 
the terms of the convertible notes require us to purchase the convertible notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change 
a takeover of our company would trigger the requirement that we purchase the convertible notes 
this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors 
we will need cash to pay at least a portion of the conversion value of the convertible notes  as required by the indenture governing the notes 
at least a portion of the repayment of the convertible notes will be required to be made in cash 
our product development plans and product offerings could be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient financial resources  or are not able to arrange suitable financing  to pay required amounts upon conversion or tender of the notes and fund our operations 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan  and employment and licensing agreements could prevent or delay a change in control or change in management that could be beneficial to us and our public stockholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan  and employment and licensing agreements may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may hinder accumulations of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change in control or change in current management 
in addition  the non competition and other restrictive covenants in all of our employees employment agreements other than those few employees who may be entitled to severance following a change in control will terminate upon a change in control that is not approved by our board of directors in accordance with the terms of such employment agreements 
further  certain of our license agreements with other companies contain a provision prohibiting each party to the agreement and its affiliates from directly or indirectly seeking to acquire or merge with us  or taking any steps in furtherance thereof  for the term of the agreement and for five years thereafter  subject to certain exceptions 
as a result  the companies that are party to these license agreements with us would be prevented from pursuing an acquisition of our company unless we consent 
furthermore  other companies may be deterred from seeking to acquire our company because of the limitations that would be imposed on further acquisition activities 
change in control restrictions in certain of our agreements could prevent or delay a change in control or change in management that could be beneficial to us and our public stockholders 
certain of our license and other agreements with other companies contain provisions restricting our ability to assign or transfer the agreement to a company which desires to merge with or acquire us 
these restrictions often require the prior consent of the other party to the agreement to a proposed change in control of our company 
in the event that the other party to a contract with us chooses to withhold its consent to such a merger or acquisition  then such party could seek to terminate the agreement and we would no longer have the rights and benefits under such agreement which may adversely affect our revenues and business prospects 
in addition  certain of our license and other agreements with other companies contain provisions allowing the other company to terminate the agreement if a third party attempts to acquire control of our company without our consent  unless certain conditions are met 
these restrictive contractual provisions may delay or discourage a change in control of our company 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial block of our common stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december   including stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of that date 
accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of our directors 
such stockholder influence could delay or prevent a change in control with respect to us 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future

overview united therapeutics corporation is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique products to address the unmet medical needs of patients with chronic and life threatening cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
we commenced operations in june and  since our inception  have devoted substantially all of our resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
our key therapeutic platforms are prostacyclin analogs  which are stable synthetic forms of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function  glycobiology antiviral agents  which are a class of small molecules that have shown pre clinical indications of efficacy against a broad range of viruses  such as hepatitis c  and monoclonal antibodies  which are antibodies that activate patients immune systems to treat cancer 
we focus most of our resources on these three key platforms 
we also devote resources to the commercialization and further development of telemedicine products and services  principally for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias 
we commenced operations in june we began to earn pharmaceutical revenues in may after we received fda approval for remodulin  our lead product  by subcutaneous under the skin infusion to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
remodulin is also approved in countries throughout the world for similar uses 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in other countries 
revenues we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of remodulin  a prostacyclin analog 
our sales and marketing team consisted of approximately employees as of december   up from approximately employees as of december   with further growth expected in our marketing team is divided into two approximately equal groups 
the first group is primarily responsible for national and large regional medical practice accounts currently prescribing remodulin  while the second group is primarily responsible for smaller  local  community oriented medical practices not currently prescribing remodulin 
our distributors augment the efforts of our sales and marketing staff 
we face stiff competition from several other companies that market and sell competing therapies and we expect this competition will continue to grow 
remodulin is sold to patients in the united states by accredo therapeutics  inc  curascript  inc  and caremark  inc  and outside of the united states by various international distributors 
we sell remodulin in bulk shipments to these distributors 
because discontinuation of our therapy can be life threatening to patients  we require that our distributors maintain inventory levels as specified in our distribution agreements 
due to the contractual requirement to maintain a minimum level of inventory  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand during that quarter 
in addition  inventory levels reported by distributors are affected by the timing of their sales around the end of each reporting period 
our us based distributors typically place one order per month  usually in the first half of the month 
the timing and magnitude of our sales of remodulin are affected by the timing and magnitude of these bulk orders from distributors 
bulk orders placed by our distributors are based on their estimates of the amount of drug required for new and existing patients  as well as maintaining the contractual level of inventory that can meet approximately thirty days demand as a contingent supply 
effective january   curascript s minimum inventory requirement was reduced from days to days to make its contractual inventory requirement consistent with those of our two other us distributors 
this inventory reduction resulted in a decrease in curascript s inventory of approximately million 
sales of remodulin are recognized as revenue when delivered to our distributors 
in march  we entered into an exclusive agreement with mochida pharmaceutical co  ltd 
mochida  to distribute subcutaneous and intravenous remodulin in japan 
mochida will be responsible  with our assistance  for obtaining japanese marketing authorization for remodulin  including conducting bridging studies required in japan 
we will supply study drug at no charge to mochida 
due to the bridging studies and required japanese regulatory reviews  commercial activities in japan are not expected to commence until or later 
upon receipt of marketing authorization and pricing approval  mochida will purchase remodulin from us at an agreed upon transfer price 
in addition  mochida has agreed to make certain exclusive distribution rights payments to us 
payments for distribution rights received through the filing of the new drug application will be recognized ratably over the estimated period of time from when the payment is due until marketing authorization is received 
in addition to revenues from sales of remodulin  we have generated revenues from telemedicine products and services primarily designed for patients in the united states with abnormal heart rhythms  called cardiac arrhythmias  and ischemic heart disease  a condition that causes poor blood flow to the heart 
we have also generated revenues from sales of arginine which deliver an amino acid that is necessary for maintaining cardiovascular function products and from royalty fees from licensing agreements in the united states and other countries 
in september  we stopped selling all arginine products based on publications discounting the benefits of arginine supplementation 
expenses since our inception  we devoted substantially all of our resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
we incur significant expenses in connection with our clinical trials and other aspects of our research and development programs 
since the approval of remodulin in  we have funded our operations from revenue generated from the sales of our products and services 
our operating expenses consist primarily of research and development  selling  general and administrative  cost of product sales and cost of service sales 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects have been and are focused on the use of treprostinil to treat cardiovascular diseases  glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies to treat infectious diseases  such as hepatitis c  dengue fever and japanese encephalitis  among other viruses  and monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response to treat a variety of cancers 
cardiovascular disease projects subcutaneous use of remodulin was approved by the fda in may and material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pah commenced thereafter 
in november  the fda approved intravenous infusion of remodulin for patients who are not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
this approval was based on data establishing the bioequivalence of intravenous remodulin with subcutaneous remodulin 
we are working to develop an inhaled formulation of treprostinil sodium for the treatment of pah 
in june  we commenced a week randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase iii trial of inhaled treprostinil in patients with pah who were also being treated with and were optimized on tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist 
this trial  triumph treprostinil inhalation used in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension  was conducted at approximately centers in the united states and europe 
in may  the fda agreed to also permit the inclusion in the trial of pah patients who were also being treated with and optimized on revatio  an oral pde inhibitor marketed by pfizer inc the fda also agreed to expand the trial size to at least patients  and to permit an interim efficacy assessment after patients had completed the trial 
we did not conduct the interim efficacy assessment 
in november  we announced the completion of our triumph trial 
the study population consisted of patients 
preliminary analysis of the triumph results demonstrates an improvement in median six minute walk mw distance by approximately meters p  using the hodges lehmann estimate and non parametric analysis of covariance in accordance with the trial s pre specified statistical analysis plan  in patients receiving inhaled treprostinil as compared to patients receiving placebo 
fda approval for inhaled treprostinil will be sought by filing a new drug application nda 
the optineb inhalation device will also be submitted for approval as part of this filing 
optineb is the ultra sonic nebulizer that was exclusively used for administration of inhaled treprostinil in the triumph trial 
optineb is manufactured by nebu tec international med products eike kern gmbh 
nebu tec  a german company 
optineb is approved in germany and in other european countries  but is not yet approved in the united states 
we expect to file the new drug application and the application for approval of the optineb device by mid fda review of the new drug application generally takes months 
we plan on filing for approval in the european union using the centralized filing process by the end of we have also begun planning an open label study in which patients on ventavis  the only currently approved inhaled prostacyclin  will be switched to inhaled treprostinil 
the study is expected to start in late and will continue through the fda regulatory approval process for inhaled treprostinil  which is currently expected to be completed by mid we are developing an oral formulation of treprostinil  treprostinil diethanolamine  a novel salt form 
two multi national placebo controlled clinical trials of oral treprostinil in patients with pah commenced in october these trials are phase iii trials  in which both dosing and efficacy are being studied 
the freedom c trial is a week study of up to patients currently on approved background therapy using a pde inhibitor  such as revatio  or an endothelin antagonist  such as tracleer  or a combination of both 
the freedom m trial is a week study of up to patients  who are not on any background therapy 
both trials are being conducted at approximately centers throughout the united states and the rest of the world 
as of december   there were approximately and patients enrolled in the freedom c and freedom m trials  respectively 
as of february  there were approximately and patients enrolled in the freedom c and freedom m trials  respectively 
we are also in the early planning stages of designing a dose ranging study for oral treprostinil to commence later in upon the completion of both freedom trials 
a dose ranging study measures the therapeutic effect of a drug at predetermined escalating doses 
the results of this study should show corresponding increased therapeutic benefit with increased dosage 
we incurred expenses of approximately million and million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on remodulin development 
we are also developing a modified release formulation of beraprost beraprost mr for pah 
beraprost mr is an oral prostacyclin analog 
in march  lung rx entered into an amended agreement with toray industries  inc toray to assume and amend the rights and obligations of the june agreement entered into between toray and us concerning the commercialization of beraprost mr 
this amended agreement is discussed in greater detail in the section entitled strategic licenses and relationships 
we recognized approximately million of expense during the year ended december   related to the licensing transaction 
approximately of expenses were incurred on beraprost mr development during the year ended december  infectious disease projects we are in the planning stages of conducting a phase ii clinical trial with miglustat  a glycobiology compound which inhibits alpha glucosidase enzymes  to initially evaluate efficacy against hepatitis c 
miglustat is approved and is currently marketed in the united states and europe by actelion ltd for the treatment of gaucher s disease  a glycolipid storage disorder 
patent protection for manufacturing the compound has expired 
as a result of our research agreement with the university of oxford  we have the exclusive right to commercialize miglustat as an anti viral agent for the treatment of hepatitis c 
our infectious disease program also includes glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in various preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for the treatment of a wide variety of viruses 
through our agreement with oxford university  we are supporting research into new glycobiology antiviral candidates 
we incurred expenses of approximately   and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  on infectious disease projects 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for infectious disease programs 
cancer disease projects in april  we entered into an agreement with altarex corp 
which later became altarex medical corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of virexx medical corp 
altarex to exclusively license monoclonal antibody immunotherapies 
in december  we announced the completion of our two pivotal trials of ovarex mab  called impact i and ii 
analysis of the results demonstrated that the studies failed to reach statistical significance 
the studies showed no difference between active standard of care followed by ovarex and control standard of care followed by placebo populations 
the results of impact i and ii were consistent with each other 
based on the results from the impact i and ii trials  we decided to terminate our license agreement with altarex and to cease further development of the entire platform of antibodies licensed thereunder 
we expect to incur approximately million in total close out costs for this program  of which we had incurred approximately  as of december  in december  we entered into two agreements with memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc to exclusively license certain rights to two investigational monoclonal antibodies  f and h  for the treatment of neuroblastoma and metastatic brain cancer 
the monoclonal antibody f is a mouse igg mab  which is currently used in an investigational setting for the treatment of neuroblastoma  a rare cancer of the sympathetic nervous system mainly affecting children 
h is also a mouse monoclonal antibody  but of the igg subclass 
the h antibody is highly reactive with a range of human solid tumors  including brain cancers 
the h antibody is in early investigational development for metastatic brain cancer 
we expect to begin clinical development of these antibodies in we incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  on cancer projects 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for the cancer programs 
project risks due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the unapproved products discussed above  including the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not properly adhere to clinical study procedures  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may not be perceived as safe and effective  other approved or investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  other ongoing or new clinical trials sponsored by other drug companies or ourselves may reduce the number of patients available for our studies  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  the fda  international regulatory authorities or local internal review boards may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or to manufacture drugs  the fda or international regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for drug manufacture  research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in the commencement of clinical trials 
if our projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals could be delayed and our operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  we cannot commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products could be delayed or be impossible to achieve 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stock option expense for corporate and marketing personnel  travel  office expenses  insurance  rent and utilities  professional fees  advertising and marketing and depreciation and amortization 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consists of the cost to manufacture or acquire products that are sold to customers 
we manufacture treprostinil using advanced intermediate compounds purchased in bulk from third party vendors 
we have approved three vendors that have the capability to manufacture greater quantities of these compounds less expensively than if we did so ourselves 
we expect to begin commercial manufacturing of treprostinil in our new facility in silver spring  maryland  in  which is when fda approval of the facility is expected 
we anticipate that upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  the need for treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient in our tablet  will be greater than the need for treprostinil sodium  the active ingredient for remodulin and inhaled treprostinil 
as a result  the manufacturing process at the silver spring facility consists of starting with an advance intermediate compound  making treprostinil diethanolamine and then converting that compound to treprostinil as demand requires 
we believe that this will allow us the most flexibility and efficiency to meet future demands for both forms of active ingredients 
cost of service sales cost of service sales consists of the salaries  stock option expense  and related overhead necessary to provide telemedicine services to customers 
future prospects we have experienced annual revenue growth exceeding each year since remodulin was approved in continued growth at a high rate is contingent upon future commercial development of our pipeline 
one of our goals is to expand the use of treprostinil based drugs to include the treatment of patients at earlier stages of the pah disease pathway 
in other words  we seek to move treprostinil from the last line of treatment for the sickest patients to front line therapy for newly diagnosed patients 
we expect to file for approval of inhaled treprostinil with the fda in mid if we are successful in obtaining fda approval in accordance with fda requirements and anticipated review period  then we expect to begin commercial sales of inhaled treprostinil in we are currently in the later stages of development of our oral treprostinil formulation 
we expect to unblind our freedom c trial in late if this trial is successful  we expect to file for approval with the fda in with commercial sales beginning in  assuming a regular fda review period 
we believe that our trials for both the inhaled and oral formulations of treprostinil will be successful and will lead to products that generate revenues 
however  for either or both of these formulations  we could be required to do additional studies which would delay commercialization 
this could reduce our ability to continue to grow our revenues at our historic rate 
delays  if they occur  should not reduce our ability to continue revenue growth of remodulin 
because pah is a progressive disease with no cure  more patients each year are diagnosed with the disease and many patients continue to deteriorate on the current approved oral and inhaled therapies 
in addition  we will need to sign new distribution agreements on acceptable terms for the inhaled and oral formulations of treprostinil in the united states and most foreign countries 
while we have been profitable for each year since  we have experienced quarterly losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
future profitability will depend on many factors  including the price  level of sales  level of reimbursement by public and private insurance payers  the impact of competitive products and the number of patients using remodulin and other currently commercialized products and services

in september  based on a recent supreme court decision concerning the enforceability of patents and a publication discounting the benefits of arginine supplementation  we decided to discontinue selling any arginine related products and we reevaluated our assumptions used in determining the recoverability of our arginine patents 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded 
in december  based on the announcement of the failure of the impact i and ii phase iii trials of ovarex in advanced ovarian cancer  the stock price of virexx declined we considered this decline to be an other than temporary impairment of approximately million

r effective january   which resulted in the recognition of employee stock option expense of approximately million  an increase in expenses of approximately million related to stock option expense for option grants to scientific advisory board members  and an increase in spending in our cancer program of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a reduction of approximately million in expenses associated with our infectious disease research program

as a result  in december  we recognized a cash salary expense of approximately million and a non cash stock option expense of approximately million  representing  options which were immediately vested 
an impairment of intangible assets related to the heartbar product trade name totaling approximately million was recorded during the year ended december  this impairment was required since the heartbar product was discontinued in january and is no longer sold 
the decision to discontinue heartbar did not impact other aspects of our arginine business  which includes sales of non heartbar arginine products and license royalties from third parties selling arginine based products 
we made this decision after evaluating the recent clinical trial results and market potential  among other things 
cost of product sales was approximately of net product sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately for the year ended december  cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  the improvement in the cost of service sales as a percentage of service revenues was due to the growth in telemedicine service sales during  with no corresponding increase in costs  as a result of scheduling efficiencies 
interest income for the year ended december   was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during and increased market interest rates 
equity loss in affiliate represents our share of northern therapeutics losses 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  northern therapeutics loss was due primarily to expenditures for its cell based gene transfer technology research for pah 
an income tax benefit of approximately million was recognized for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the benefit in was due to an approximately million reduction in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets as of december  the reduction of the valuation allowance is based on our review of both historical and projected taxable income which has shown that it is more likely than not that certain portions of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  a reduction of the valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carry forwards  all of our business credits and other temporary assets was required 
the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million is on those deferred tax assets that need a capital gain to occur in order to be recognized 
because these events are not likely to occur in the near future  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance 
prior to  due to the company s long history of operating losses  we did not believe our deferred tax assets had a realizable value and they were fully reserved 
as a result  we did not report tax benefits or deferred tax assets prior to in  we reduced the valuation reserve by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources until may  we funded the majority of our operations from the net proceeds of sales of our common stock 
since may  we have funded the majority of our operations from revenues  mainly remodulin related  and we expect this to continue 
we believe that our existing revenues  together with existing working capital resources consisting primarily of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  will be adequate to fund our operations 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a risk factors we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable and item a risk factors we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenue or profits 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to growth in sales of remodulin and the collections on receivables from sales 
in addition  for the year ended december   we also received approximately million in stock option exercise proceeds and in excess tax benefits related to the stock option exercises as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  with the increase of our common stock price in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a much larger than usual volume of stock option exercises 
we don t expect that the level of stock option exercises experienced in the fourth quarter of will continue into unless our common stock price increases in a similar magnitude as it did in our working capital at december   was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of our million convertible senior notes convertible notes from long term debt to short term debt as of december   as a result of these convertible notes becoming eligible for conversion by the bondholders 
our expectation  based on our understanding of historical behavior of holders of convertible notes with terms similar to ours  is that our convertible notes will continue to be held until they mature in october consequently  we believe that we have approximately million of working capital available at december   for our operating needs 
we are currently constructing an approximately  square foot facility in research triangle park  north carolina  which will consist of a manufacturing operation and offices 
the manufacturing operation will primarily be for oral treprostinil  although it is expected to support other programs  and the offices will be used by our clinical development and sales and marketing staffs  who currently occupy a leased facility in the area 
construction of this facility is expected to be completed in early the project may cost up to million  and we expect to fund the construction of this facility from our current working capital and working capital generated from existing operations 
as of december   we have spent approximately million on this construction project 
in march  we entered into a construction management agreement with dpr construction  inc dpr  based in falls church  virginia 
dpr will manage the construction of our manufacturing and office facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
the agreement has a guaranteed maximum price clause in which dpr agrees that the construction cost of the facility will not exceed approximately million  which amount is subject to change with agreed upon changes to the scope of work 
dpr will be responsible for covering any costs in excess of the guaranteed maximum price 
if the ultimate cost of the project is less than the guaranteed maximum price  we will share a portion of these savings with dpr 
in addition  dpr must pay us penalties if the construction is not completed by february  which date is subject to change based on agreed upon changes to the scope of work 
dpr has no material relationship with us or any of our affiliates 
at the end of december  we began construction of a new office and laboratory building which will connect to our current laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the cost of this project is expected to be approximately million 
the construction of this facility is expected to take two years to complete 
based on the current amount of working capital and working capital to be generated from future operations  we have decided to self fund this construction project 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million in interest to the holders of our convertible notes 
we are required to pay a semi annual interest payment of  to our bondholders until the convertible notes mature in october under our existing license agreements we are obligated to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin that exceed annual net sales of million and on all arginine royalty fees received 
royalties on sales of all products currently marketed range up to percent of sales of those products and are recorded as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued million of convertible notes 
proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchaser s  deutsche bank securities inc deutsche bank  discount and commission and estimated expenses were approximately million 
the convertible notes were issued at par value and pay interest in cash semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning in april the convertible notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes have an initial conversion price of per share 
the convertible notes may only be converted i any time after july   ii during any calendar quarter commencing after the date of original issuance of the notes  if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than of the conversion price of the notes in effect on that last trading day  iii during the ten consecutive trading day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each such trading day was less than of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then current conversion rate  or iv if specified significant distributions to holders of our common stock are made  specified corporate transactions occur  or our common stock ceases to be approved for listing on the nasdaq global select market and is not listed for trading on another us national or regional securities exchange 
upon conversion  a holder will receive i cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value  and ii to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note  shares of our common stock 
in addition  upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture under which the convertible notes have been issued  the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus a number of additional shares of our common stock  as set forth in the related indenture 
the indenture under which the convertible notes were issued contains customary covenants 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes see note in the consolidated financial statements  we purchased call options on our common stock in a private transaction with deutsche bank ag london the call option 
the call option allows us to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock at per share from deutsche bank ag london  equal to the amount of our common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion 
the convertible notes are generally convertible once our stock price exceeds per share 
the call option will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity dates of the related convertible notes or the first day all of the related convertible notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the call option  which cost approximately million  was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
in a separate transaction that took place concurrently with the issuance of the convertible notes  we sold warrants to deutsche bank ag london under which deutsche bank ag london has the right to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share the warrant 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million and were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the combination of the call option and warrant effectively serves to reduce the potential dilutive effect of the conversion the convertible notes 
the call option has a strike price equal to the conversion price for the convertible notes  and the warrant has a higher strike price of per share that serves to cap the amount of dilution protection provided 
the call option and warrant are settled on a net share basis 
the warrant may be settled in registered or  subject to certain potential adjustments in the delivery amount  unregistered shares 
furthermore  if additional shares are required to be delivered with respect to a settlement in unregistered shares or any anti dilution adjustments in the related convertible notes  the warrant provides that in no event shall we be required to deliver in excess of approximately million shares in connection with the warrant 
we have reserved approximately million shares for the settlement of the warrant and have sufficient shares available as of december   to effect such settlement 
deutsche bank ag london is responsible for providing of the necessary shares of our common stock upon an exercise of the call option triggered upon conversion of the convertible notes by a bondholder 
the shares of our common stock that deutsche bank ag london will deliver must be obtained from existing shareholders 
if the market price per share of our common stock is above per share  we will be required to deliver to deutsche bank ag london shares of our common stock representing the value in excess of the warrant strike price 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
and sfas  these transactions meet the definition of equity and are indexed to our common stock  therefore  the call option and warrant are not considered derivative instruments or required to be accounted for separately 
stock repurchases in july  in a privately negotiated transaction  we repurchased  shares of our common stock  par value per share  from toray industries for a cash purchase price of approximately million or per share  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between toray industries and us 
the purchase price was the average of the closing price of our common stock for the consecutive trading days ending july  toray industries retains ownership of  shares of our common stock 
due to our desire to return value to our shareholders  on october   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
as of december   approximately million shares have been repurchased under the program at a cost of approximately million 
approximately million shares of our common stock were repurchased using approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes  based on the closing price of our common stock on october   of 
the remaining shares were repurchased on the open market 
as of december   we had approximately  shares remaining under the approved stock repurchase program 
we may also repurchase shares outside of this program 
under the amended and restated agreement with toray entered into in march  we issued to toray  shares of our common stock which are subject to repurchase 
toray has the right  upon days prior written notice  to request that we repurchase these newly issued shares at the price of per share  which was the average closing price of our common stock between january   and february  we have not received notice from toray to repurchase any of these shares of our common stock 
income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the tax benefit generated for was primarily due to the amount of tax credits generated during the year from our orphan drug related research and development activities 
for the years ended december  and  the tax benefit recognized is due primarily to reductions of approximately million and million  respectively  in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our determination that certain of these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable 
at december   we had  for federal income tax purposes  net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and business tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire at various dates from through the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards is attributable to exercised stock options  the benefit of which was realized as direct increases in additional paid in capital 
business tax credits can offset future tax liabilities and arise from qualified research expenditures 
we have been and may continue to be subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes  even though we have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have paid and expect to continue to pay state income taxes 
a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards continues to be reserved through a valuation allowance as of december  section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes occur as defined by that section 
we have annually reviewed our ownership change position pursuant to section through december   we have determined that ownership changes have occurred in december  june  and november and  as a result  the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
however  we do not expect any significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards or general business tax credits to expire unused 
we are currently reviewing the ownership changes for the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangement in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  wachovia funded million towards the construction of the laboratory facility on land owned by us 
the construction phase commenced in and was completed in may following construction  wachovia leased the laboratory facility to us with a term ending in may under the year ground lease  wachovia paid fair value rent to us for use of the land during the construction phase and will pay fair value rent after the laboratory lease is terminated 
during the term of the laboratory lease  wachovia will pay per year to us for use of the land 
we pledged a portion of our marketable investments as collateral to secure our lease obligations 
at december   approximately million of marketable investments and cash were pledged as collateral and are reported as restricted marketable investments and cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
upon termination of the lease  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease subject to approval of both parties  purchasing the laboratory at a price approximately equal to the funded construction cost  or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we have guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least of the amount it funded toward construction 
the maximum potential amount of this guarantee is approximately million  equivalent to of the total construction costs of million 
we have reported the fair value of this guarantee as a non current asset prepaid rent and non current liability other liability 
at december   the liability and the corresponding asset are approximately  net of accumulated amortization 
the laboratory lease and other agreements require  among other things  that we maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million 
the agreements contain other covenants and conditions with which we must comply throughout the lease periods and upon termination of the lease 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants and conditions  if the noncompliance went uncured  and if the parties could not agree otherwise  the agreements could terminate 
a termination of these agreements could result in the loss of our liquid collateral  among other consequences 
wachovia receives monthly payments from us  generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
this monthly payment commenced when the laboratory construction was completed in may and will continue until the termination of the lease in may the monthly payment from may through december is recorded as rent expense 
upon completion of our laboratory facility in may  wachovia advanced to us approximately million  which constituted the remaining funds available for construction due to the lengthy process involved in finalizing construction costs 
at december   there were no remaining construction advances 
based on construction costs of approximately million and the then current effective rate of approximately equivalent to the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points at december   the payments to be made are approximately million annually 
in addition  wachovia paid us ground rent of approximately  in june covering the construction period through may this amount is being recognized as income ratably through may we intend to enter into a construction agreement that generally obligates us to complete construction on a new combination laboratory and office building that will connect to our existing silver spring  maryland  laboratory facility 
upon execution of an amendment to our leasing agreements with wachovia permitting us to attach the new facility to the existing silver spring laboratory facility  the estimated fair value of the building and the corresponding financing obligation to wachovia will be classified as a component of our property  plant and equipment and as a lease obligation in our consolidated balance sheet 
the existing silver spring laboratory facility will not be considered a standalone structure  which is a significant factor contributing to our current off balance sheet accounting of it 
we will continue to make lease payments to wachovia as specified in the agreement  however  those payments will be recorded as interest expense and a reduction to the lease obligation instead of as an operating lease payment 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations coming due approximately as follows in thousands payment due in total to to and later notes payable and capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations     purchase obligations     other long term obligations milestone payments     totals      in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the principal balance of the notes is to be repaid in cash 
the notes can be redeemed by the bondholders once the market price of our common stock exceeds for a specified period which was satisfied as of december  while the convertible notes are classifed as current  we believe that the bondholders will hold the notes until maturity in october includes specified payments to toray for clinical trial material and related services 
upon termination of the synthetic operating lease with wachovia for the laboratory facility  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease  purchasing the laboratory or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we guaranteed wachovia that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least of the amount it funded towards the construction 
the final cost of constructing the laboratory was approximately million and the guarantee is estimated at approximately million 
the remaining value of the guarantee is included in other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position 
see the section entitled off balance sheet arrangement above for additional information 
we licensed products from other companies under license agreements 
these agreements generally include milestone payments to be paid in cash by us upon the achievement of product development and commercialization goals set forth in each license agreement 
total milestone payments under these license agreements have been estimated based on the assumption that the products currently under study will be successfully developed and on the estimated timing of these development and commercialization goals 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing surrounding future payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
summary of critical accounting policies income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported in the balance sheet 
at each reporting date  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire net deferred tax asset is realizable 
if the net deferred tax asset is not fully realizable  then a valuation allowance is established to reduce the amount of net deferred tax assets reported in the balance sheet 
based on the weight of available evidence at december   it was determined that a partial valuation allowance totaling approximately million was necessary at december  uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and an interpretation of sfas no 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which comprise our customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
had the net basis been applied  the amounts of revenues and cost of product sales reported in the consolidated financial statements would have been lower  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
prompt payment discounts  government rebates and fees to a distributor are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
had these discounts  rebates and fees not been reported as reductions of revenue  the amounts reported as revenues and selling expenses would have been higher  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be replaced  but not returned 
we follow the guidance provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
exchanges for expired or damaged in shipment product is generally less that of the volume of vials that we sell 
an exchange for expired vials generally occurs months after the vial was sold 
reserves for exchanges are not recorded unless product expiration or damage occurred during shipping are known to us 
the shelf life of remodulin is two and one half years from the date of its manufacture 
we rely on our distributors to report damage in shipment or expirations of remodulin product 
one of our remodulin distribution agreements stipulated minimum quarterly purchases by the distributor for periods through june   and no minimum quarterly purchases after june  the distribution agreement  however  does not permit the distributor to return remodulin product solely based on the distributor s ability or inability to resell the product 
as a result  revenues from sales to this distributor are recognized in the period that the remodulin product is delivered to the distributor 
during the years ended december   and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  was recognized as revenue from sales to this distributor who has made voluntary purchases since june  we closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channels for contractual compliance 
the shelf life of remodulin is months 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity with which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in the ordinary course of business 
we record remodulin and related product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  medicaid discounts  and fees paid to distributors 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
prompt payment discounts we offer our distributors a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
these discounts are accounted for by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and applying earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
if information is available  such as an outstanding invoice  which would indicate that the invoice will not be paid within the discount period  we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from the accrual amount 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust the rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid a quarter in arrears  so that the accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  and an estimated accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates 
while we have not experienced large variability in our estimated rates of rebates  using historical amounts and trends could lead to fluctuations in recorded revenue due to differences between amounts accrued and amounts actually paid 
distributor fee and non refundable upfront license revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy for all non refundable upfront license and distribution rights fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in addition  we follow the provisions of eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf for multiple element revenue arrangements 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license or distribution rights fees and research and development activities can be accounted for as separate units of accounting  non refundable upfront license and distribution fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of certain research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
milestones are considered substantive if all the following criteria are met the milestone payment is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions is not met  we would recognize a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to work already performed and the remaining portion of the milestone payment would be deferred and recognized as we complete our performance obligations 
intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test that is performed on october st of each year 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
if we believe impairment has occurred  we generally use a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the actual impairment 
at december   we believed that goodwill was not impaired and therefore no impairment losses have been recorded 
this conclusion is based on our judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
marketable investments currently  we invest portions of our cash in marketable debt securities issued primarily by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
we do invest in state and municipal government agencies  mainly auction rate securities and in selected corporate debt issues 
due to our intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  these investments are reported at their amortized cost 
we believe that we are able to hold these investments to maturity  due to the significant level of cash and cash equivalents that we have and the generally short term nature of the investments 
the weighted average maturity on these investments is approximately months 
if we did not have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity  we would have reported them in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair market values with changes in the fair value being recorded in our results of operations 
at december   the amortized cost of these debt securities was approximately million and their fair values were approximately million 
stock options effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all equity based payments granted prior to but not yet vest as of january  this estimation is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and compensation cost for all equity based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we have utilized the black scholes merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock options granted since adoption of sfas no 
r  as well as  for option grants during all prior periods 
the black scholes merton valuation model includes many assumptions that are subject to substantial judgments  such as risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  expected term of options and expected forfeiture rate 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
we use the historical volatility based on the weekly price observations of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term up to a maximum of five years 
we believe that historical volatility within the last five years represents the best estimate of future long term volatility 
risk free interest rate this is the average interest rate consistent with the yield available on a us treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants at the date the option was granted 
expected term of options this is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain outstanding 
we adopted sab s simplified method for estimating the expected term of share based awards granted during the year ended december  and the use of sab to calculate expected term has been extended past the original curtailment date of december  we are evaluating the historical holding patterns of our options to determine if we can calculate a reasonable estimate of expected term for stock option grants beginning in given the increase in our stock price  our stock options could be exercised sooner than we have seen in prior years 
expected dividend yield we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
as such  the dividend yield percentage is assumed to be zero 
expected forfeiture rate this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled on an annual basis before becoming fully vested 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom options were granted 
investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for some of our investments in affiliates  including northern therapeutics  inc northern 
the equity method of accounting generally requires that we report our share of our affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by us 
although our investment in northern exceeds  minority shareholders possess substantive participating rights that preclude northern s financial statements from being consolidated 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than ownership by us 
the cost method of accounting does not require that we report our share of the affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
lease of laboratory facility in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the construction of the laboratory facility was completed in may the total cost of the construction was million 
the laboratory facility is owned by wachovia  the lessor 
we are the lessee and pay rent to wachovia now that the facility is completed 
this arrangement is a form of off balance sheet financing under which wachovia funded of the costs for the construction of the property and now leases the laboratory facility to us 
we have provided a residual value guarantee to wachovia that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  eitf issue no 
 implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities  eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  we determined that the lease is properly classified as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
furthermore  we determined that wachovia has sufficient substance such that it can be treated as an unrelated entity and  accordingly  does not require consolidation into our financial statements 
operating leases of assets do not require that the leased asset and the related rent obligation be reported in the lessee s balance sheet  but rather be disclosed as future commitments 
in contrast  capital leases do require that the leased asset and rent obligations be reported in the lessee s balance sheet as assets and debt 
changes in the levels of investment made by wachovia and its affiliates in the laboratory could affect the classification of the lease from operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the assets and debt associated with the laboratory facility on our balance sheet 
senior executive retirement plan we account for our senior executive retirement plan serp in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  and related standards and interpretations 
in accordance with sfas  a material change in the plan  such as adding a participant which occurred in august  requires a remeasurement of the plan 
since there are no plan assets  no interest on assets is assumed earned 
with the addition of a participant in  there is an unrecognized prior service cost of approximately  as of december  which will be amortized over the next years  the average expected future service period of all the plan participants 
in addition  any unrealized actuarial losses will be amortized as an expense only when the cumulative unrecognized losses exceed of projected benefit obligations 
benefit payments are not expected to be paid over the next five years since no current participants will reach the age of within this time period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of our assets was comprised of debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
likewise  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize such market risk  we hold such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments will be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   we had approximately million in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies and corporations with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately maturing through march and callable annually 
the fair market value based on quoted market prices of this held to maturity portfolio at december   was approximately million 
at december   a portion of our assets was comprised of auction rate debt securities issued by state sponsored agencies 
while these securities have long term maturities  their interest rates are reset approximately every days through an auction process 
as a result  the interest income from these securities is subject to market risk since the rate is adjusted to accommodate market conditions on each reset date 
however  since the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions  the fair value of these securities typically does not fluctuate from par or cost 
at december   we had approximately million in these debt securities with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately 
the fair market value based on quoted market prices of these available for sale debt securities as of december  was approximately million 
at february   we held approximately million of investments in municipal notes  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
the underlying assets of these investments are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions failed for approximately million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our investments in the near term may be limited 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  are currently rated aaa  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant losses within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity of these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan or the carrying value of these investments 
in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  we pay rents to wachovia generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
the total amount of construction was million 
these rents  therefore  are subject to the risk that the libor rate will increase or decrease during the period until termination in may at december   the day libor rate was approximately 
for every movement of basis points in the day libor rate  the rents under this lease could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
