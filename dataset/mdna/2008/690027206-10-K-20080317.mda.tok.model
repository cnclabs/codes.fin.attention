general in april our board of directors  after considering reports of consultants and on going analysis of management  decided that the operations of the membership division  comprised of gpaa  llc and ldma au  inc  was no longer strategic to the core business of outdoor channel holdings 
we applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas to the membership division s assets and liabilities classifying them as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations 
the sale of the membership division was for its net asset value and accordingly we have not adjusted its carrying value 
the sale was consummated on april  prior to june   we had reported separate segment information in our filings for the operations of toc and the membership division in the same format as reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 
due to the discontinued operations of the membership division  we now operate in a single segment 

table of contents through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  the outdoor channel  inc or toc  we own and operate outdoor channel which is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
outdoor channel holdings  inc also wholly owns bpd  llc that owns the building housing our broadcast facility 
our revenues include advertising fees from advertisements aired on outdoor channel and subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
advertising fees include fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel 
acquisition of minority interest in the outdoor channel  inc on september   we announced the completion of the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in toc by outdoor channel holdings through i the merger of toc with a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of outdoor channel holdings  with toc being the surviving corporation  and ii the exchange of each share of toc common stock not previously held by outdoor channel holdings or its subsidiaries for shares of outdoor channel holdings common stock 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase one share of toc common stock was exchanged for an option to purchase shares of outdoor channel holdings common stock 
based on the exchange ratio  outdoor channel holdings issued  shares of our common stock as well as options to purchase  additional shares on september  as previously disclosed by us  in october  we received notice from a toc stockholder that the stockholder was exercising dissenters rights with respect to previously outstanding toc common shares 
the dissenter submitted a written demand that toc repurchase the dissenter s shares 
on march   the dissenter withdrew this demand and accepted common shares of the company in exchange for his common shares of toc 
the number of shares exchanged reflects the exchange ratio 
for accounting purposes  the dissenter s shares have been deemed to have been exchanged as of september  and the cost of those shares has been recorded as additional goodwill 
the acquisition of all of the minority interest in toc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of acquiring the minority interest included the aggregate fair value of the common shares of outdoor channel holdings issued in exchange for common shares of toc and certain other direct costs 
the acquisition cost was allocated based on the fair value of the assets of toc that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  including intangible assets that arose from contractual or other legal rights or met certain other recognition criteria that underlie the approximate minority interest that was acquired 
the excess of the cost of the minority interest over the fair value of the underlying interest in the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes the tax effects of the intangible assets have been treated as additional consideration 
this additional consideration has also been allocated to goodwill 
the cost of the acquisition of the minority interest in toc by outdoor channel holdings was  based on the issuance at the closing of  shares of outdoor channel holdings common stock including the former dissenter s shares and the average closing price of per share for a specified period before and after april   the last trading day before the public announcement of the material terms of the acquisition 
based on the fair value of the assets that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  the acquisition costs were allocated primarily to intangible assets principally  to goodwill and  to advertising customer relationships 
the exchange of vested options by outdoor channel holdings for vested options of toc resulted in a charge to operations in the consolidated statement of operations on september  equal to the intrinsic value of the options issued on that date and a credit for the related income tax benefit 
outdoor channel holdings issued fully vested options to purchase  shares in exchange for fully vested options held by employees of toc on september  on that day  the market price of one share of common stock of outdoor channel holdings was 
as a result  the company incurred a non cash  non recurring charge to operating expenses of  and recognized an income tax benefit of  or a net charge of  
table of contents effects of restatement this form k amends our previously filed form k for the year ended december  to reflect adjustments to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  arising from the effects of accounting for equity awards to employees and non employees  certain revenue cutoff issues which generally result in intra period timing fluctuations  accounting for the cost escalation provisions related to the terms of the lease of our headquarters  and adjustment to the estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements to match the terms of our lease of our headquarters 
we determined that the effects of these adjustments were immaterial  individually and in the aggregate  to our annual report for the year ended december  and thus we did not amend that filing 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes have been restated to reflect the effects of these adjustments as further explained in note critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues for outdoor channel are recognized when the advertisement is aired 
subscriber fees for outdoor channel are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor and collection is probable 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  mso relationships  advertising customer relationships  and trademarks  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and  accordingly  all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for assets to be held and used are then measured based on the excess  if any  of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of in a manner that meets specific criteria are stated at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our only reporting 
table of contents unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step in order to determined the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
prepaid programming costs we produce a portion of the programming we air on our channels in house as opposed to acquiring the programming from third party producers 
the cost of production is expensed when the show airs 
as such  we have incurred costs for programming that is yet to air 
these costs are accumulated on the balance sheet as prepaid programming costs 
costs of specific shows will be charged to programming expense based on anticipated airings  when the program airs and the related advertising revenue is recognized 
at the time it is determined that a program will not likely air  we charge to expense any remaining costs recorded in prepaid programming costs 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated  whether due to customer specific or general economic issues  increases in the allowance may be made 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires us to record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
sfas r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with this transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  share based compensation expense for and includes compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted prior to  but for which the requisite service has not yet been performed as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
share based compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date for fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r using the black scholes option pricing model 
we account for stock options granted to non employees using the fair value method 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and eitf no 
accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense and deferred compensation in the financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax assets and income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the income tax provision is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
with our adoption of sfas r on january  we present  on a prospective basis  the tax benefits from exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense as a cash flow from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through december  this requirement reduces the amount reflected as net cash provided by operating activities and increases net cash provided by financing activities 
total cash flows remained unchanged from that which would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
we recognize such benefits only if they have been realized which we determine by following the tax law method  which provides that current deductions are recognized before realizing the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards 
investments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our investments in marketable debt and equity securities have been classified as available for sale securities and  accordingly  are valued at fair value at the end of each period 
any material unrealized holding gains and losses arising from such valuation are excluded from net income and reported  net of applicable income taxes  in other comprehensive income 
accumulated net unrealized holding gains and losses are included at the end of each year in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a separate component of stockholders equity

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  the following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented  expressed in terms of dollars  dollar change  percentage change and as a percent of total revenue all dollar amounts are in thousands change of total revenue as restated revenues advertising subscriber fees total revenues cost of services programming satellite transmission fees production and operations other direct costs total cost of services other expenses advertising selling  general and administrative impairment of amortizable intangible assets depreciation and amortization total other expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss percentages may not add due to rounding revenues our revenues include revenues from advertising fees and subscriber fees 
advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on outdoor channel including advertisements shown during a program also known as short form advertising and infomercials in which the advertisement is the program itself also known as long form advertising 
advertising revenue is also generated from fees paid by third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel 
subscriber fees are generated from cable and satellite service providers who pay monthly subscriber fees to us for the right to broadcast our channel 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 

table of contents advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects higher prices paid for advertising time partially offset by reduced revenue from sales of advertising inventory to third party programmers as a slightly higher percentage of our inventory was retained for in house sales 
for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million viewers compared to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen s estimate is million 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen might even report additional declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers both from new and existing affiliates as well as contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying outdoor channel 
we are pursuing subscriber growth utilizing various means including deployment of rate relief for new and existing subscribers and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
as a result of a combination of these tactics  we anticipate our net subscriber fee revenue will decrease over the short term future as we deploy this strategy 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing our broadcast signal and programming to the distributors for transmission to the consumer 
cost of services includes programming costs  satellite transmission fees  production and operations costs  and other direct costs 
total cost of services for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improved rate reflects the impact of price increases noted above and reduced programming expense as more fully discussed below 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for year ended december  the decrease is principally a result of our decision to no longer program a second chanel in as we did in and to increase the repeat rate within the schedule of our in house shows 
our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has historically been over or quarters that generally did not extend over more than years 
for  the anticipated airing schedule is typically over quarters but might be charged in more than one fiscal year 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we charge programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
as noted above  
table of contents we have implemented a new programming strategy which may include more airings per show including a greater number of repeat episodes within the quarter 
as we enter  our programming costs per show are expected to increase as we continue to improve the quality of our in house produced shows  and we expect our aggregate programming costs to increase somewhat from levels 
as our programming strategy evolves  we will reconsider the appropriate timing of the charge to expense of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  we are in negotiations with our satellite provider to have our current satellite replaced in the near future with a new satellite and use less bandwidth for our signal at reduced rates 
final negotiations have not been completed 
it is possible that our existing contract will be terminated early resulting in the write off of deferred satellite rent obligations or if the terms so dictate  an amendment to the recognition of this obligation in our income statement 
since the final terms of the new agreement have not been negotiated  the final accounting treatment has yet to be determined 
in any event  we expect to reduce satellite transmission fees in future periods 
production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs principally relates to costs associated with establishing our new broadband web site and costs related to our new broadcast facility 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase principally relates to a greater number of subscribers for which we have paid launch support to acquire in the last half of resulting in more expense recognized through amortization in the year ended december  compared to the same period in other expenses other expenses consist of the cost of advertising  selling  general and administrative expenses  impairment of amortizable intangible assets  and depreciation and amortization 
total other expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of incurring an impairment of amortizable intangible assets in of  for which we did not have a similar charge in the year ended december  and reduced spending on advertising in anticipation during the first half of the year to adopt a new logo and the elimination of our nascar sponsorship 
the decrease in other expenses for the year ended december  was offset by several factors including  of expense related to performance units granted to our chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of  increased legal fees related to negotiation of our carriage agreements and the sale of the membership division  increased accounting fees incurred in related to an increased financial reporting effort and increased professional fees related to consultants hired to help us execute our business plan as well as helping us assess our membership division segment 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we reduced our spending on advertising during related to our print media campaigns and our race program sponsorship 
we have terminated our sponsorship of a nascar team  believing the expenditure will be more effectively deployed otherwise 
further  due to our re branding initiative  we delayed other tactics during the first six months of to fully benefit from our new logo and programming initiatives which was launched during the third quarter of we believe that our advertising expenses will increase in the short term as we continue to deploy tactics to increase and maintain our subscriber base and the number of viewers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we granted our chief executive officer two tranches of performance units of 
table of contents  shares each which vest upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels 
we have calculated their fair value using a lattice model 
the first tranche has an estimated value of  and has an expected service period of months 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  related to this grant 
the second grant of  performance units was calculated to have a fair value of  and an expected service period of months 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  of compensation expense related to this grant 
the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative fees related primarily to consulting fees pertaining to execution of our strategic plan  accounting fees for the audit of our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in related to the fiscal year and related to increased filing requirements in  increased legal fees related to negotiation of carriage relationships and the sale of the membership division and to other operating costs 
we anticipate a decline in selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs  excluding share based compensation charges  will continue to increase over the foreseeable future 
we are adding to our professional and support staff across all departments to support our initiatives in subscriber growth and in other areas such as accounting and finance 
we utilize share based compensation packages as incentives for our employees 
during  we have utilized restricted stock grants as opposed to stock options or performance units 
restricted stock awards are deductible for tax purposes at their fair market value on the day such awards vest 
as of december   we have fully expensed the performance units awarded to our chief executive officer 
although we may find it necessary to motivate prospective or current employees with additional cash and or equity awards  we expect our share based compensation charges to decline 
impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was  we did not incur such a charge in the year ended december  during the three months ended september   we engaged third party consultants to review our business practices and strategy 
among the areas reviewed was our approach to grow our subscriber base through our relationships with msos 
prior to this time our strategy was to focus on incremental growth opportunities without impacting our existing subscriber base 
our consultants completed a market survey and other steps they deemed appropriate 
in september of  the board of directors concluded that a complete revision of the terms of the relationships was necessary to meet the subscriber growth goals established by management 
we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment 
among the components of the plan was subscriber rate relief in some form for both existing subscriber relationships and the incremental if any subscribers that might be added to our subscriber base as a result of the planned actions 
acknowledging the changed circumstances  we assessed fair value of our intangible assets and concluded that our mso relationships asset had become fully impaired 
accordingly we have written off the carrying value of  during the year ended december  we further concluded that the carrying values of our other intangible assets had not been impaired nor do we believe that the changed circumstances have affected the estimated lives of the amortizable intangible assets 
we continue to believe that as of december  the carrying values have not been impaired nor have circumstances changed that affect their estimated lives 
however  these estimates will continue to be reviewed during each reporting period to determine whether circumstances continue to support their estimated useful lives and fair value 
estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the determination of the fair value 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or the amortizable intangibles and a noncash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to amortization expense of our mso relationship asset recorded prior to its becoming fully impaired and written off during the year ended this decrease was partially offset by a full year of deprecation related to the completion of our new broadcast facility as compared to only eight months of depreciation in the prior year 

table of contents income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was a loss of  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the improvement in our loss from operations was driven by increased prices we are realizing for our advertising inventory  growth in our subscriber base and lower advertising costs as we delayed marketing activities to correspond with the launch of our new branding initiative  lower programming costs as we refined our broadcast airing schedule 
these improvements in our operating results were offset by increased compensation related to our professional and support staff  professional fees and other charges 
for the twelve month comparative periods we incurred an impairment charge related to our mso relationship intangible asset in which did not recur in as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  subscriber rate relief for our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch or advertising support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as broadband  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be constrained for the short term future until scale is achieved 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense incurred in the year ended december  relates to the filing of our income tax returns in states in which we had nexus but previously had not filed our income tax returns 
the interest expense incurred in the year ended december  relates to two term loans obtained in november with an original aggregate principal amount of  with effective fixed interest rates of and which we repaid in october other income other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased average balances of our investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalents balances 
we anticipate a decline in dividends and interest earned in future periods 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to an income tax benefit from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the tax effect of accounting for share based compensation in december  as compared to the amounts recognized to tax expense in the year ended december  the effective income tax provision benefit was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the reasons stated above

table of contents advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million subscribers compared to million for the same period a year before 
the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects higher prices paid by third party programmers for advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs  incremental advertising inventory retained by us to sell and additional revenue generated by our technical services department for providing production services for third party programmers 
these factors contributing to the increase were offset somewhat by less demand for our long form inventory that resulted in lower prices paid for infomercial blocks 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen increased its estimate to almost million subscribers 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen might even report declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees for the period was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers both from new affiliates and from existing distributors and contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying outdoor channel 
we plan to accelerate our subscriber growth utilizing various means including deployment of rate relief for new and existing subscribers and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
as a result of a combination of these tactics  we anticipate subscriber fee revenue  net will decrease over the short term future as we deploy this strategy 
cost of services total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of services  as further discussed below  relates principally to increased programming costs related to producing shows to air on our second network  which we did not have in the first half of programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is principally a result of our decision to launch our second channel  outdoor channel hd  on july  we incurred minimal programming costs relative to this channel in the first and second quarters of as most of such costs incurred at that time were charged to prepaid programming costs in anticipation of its launch in the second half of our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has typically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we charge programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we reassessed our programming direction during the fourth quarter of and charged to expense over  of prepaid programming costs that had otherwise been planned to air and then be expensed in the future 
programming expenses are expected to stabilize as a percentage of revenue over the near term 
further  we are considering a new programming strategy 
table of contents which will include more airings per show including a greater number of repeat episodes within the quarter and potentially more quarters extending over more years 
as this plan is developed we will reconsider the appropriate timing of the charge to expense of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  we do not expect significant fluctuations in satellite transmission fees other than marginal increases reflecting contractual price increases over the foreseeable future 
production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs principally relates to increased personnel to support our growing infrastructure as we produce more shows in house and to support our new broadcast facility 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in other direct costs principally relates to a reduction in the design and printing costs associated with simplifying our program guide 
other expenses total other expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in other expenses was due to several factors including the write off of  of the carrying value of mso relationships as a result of a changed distribution strategy adopted by the board in september  adoption of sfas r effective january  resulting in additional compensation expense of  in addition  from the recognized expense related to performance units granted to our new ceo in the fourth quarter of  additional depreciation expense resulting from our broadcast facility which was placed into service effective april   and other items more fully described as follows 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we had planned increased advertising expenditures but delayed such in anticipation of launching a cross channel television advertising campaign  which began in late september of selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas r as of january   which now requires us to charge the fair value of stock options we have issued to our employees over the vesting period to compensation expense that we did not have to record in the non cash charge in the year ended december  amounted to  additionally  we granted our new ceo two tranches of performance units of  shares each which vest in  and  share increments based upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels 
we have calculated their fair value using a lattice model 
the first tranche has an estimated value of  and has an expected service period of months 
in  we recognized  related to this grant 
the second grant of  performance units which vest in  share increments based upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels was calculated to have a fair value of  and an expected service period of months years 
in we recognized  of compensation expense related to this grant 
we incurred  of severance and related fees related to toc s former ceo 
the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative fees related primarily to increased research fees to support our selling efforts  consulting fees pertaining to assistance in the development of our strategic plan  accounting fees for the audit of our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in related to the fiscal year  legal fees incurred in the first quarter as a result of our ongoing efforts related to our carriage agreement negotiations and to other operating costs 

table of contents impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  carried a charge of  as a result of our quarterly impairment review of amortizable intangible assets and goodwill 
during the year ended december   we engaged third party consultants to review our business practices and strategy 
among the areas reviewed was our approach to grow our subscriber base through our relationships with our msos 
prior to this time our strategy was to focus on incremental growth opportunities without impacting our existing subscriber base 
our consultants completed a market survey and other steps they deemed appropriate 
in september  the consultants concluded  and the board of directors accepted their conclusions  that a complete revision of the terms of the relationships was necessary to meet the subscriber growth goals established by us 
upon acceptance of that conclusion and general strategy outlined by the consultants  we reviewed our amortizable intangible assets for impairment 
among the components of the plan was subscriber rate relief in some form for both existing subscriber relationships and the incremental if any subscribers that might be added to our subscriber base as a result of the planned actions 
acknowledging the changed circumstances  we assessed the fair value of our amortizable intangible assets and concluded that our mso relationships asset had become fully impaired 
accordingly we have charged to expense  the carrying value of  during the year ended december  we further concluded that the carrying values of our other intangible assets have not been impaired nor do we believe that the changed circumstances have affected the estimated lives of the amortizable intangible assets 
however  these estimates will continue to be reviewed during each reporting period to determine whether circumstances continue to support their estimated useful lives and fair value 
estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the determination of the fair value 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or the amortizable intangibles and a non cash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation primarily relates to the inventory of hd cameras and editing equipment that we began purchasing in and continued in to support our broadcast facility which was placed into service april  income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was a loss of  a decrease of  compared to income of  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the losses in the year ended december  were driven by the impairment of amortizable intangible assets resulting in a charge of  during the period 
this loss was partially offset by growth of our revenue 
the decrease experienced over the year ended december  was compounded by increased programming costs associated with the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  in the second half of  the expensing of programming costs related to programs we no longer anticipate airing  increased compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r and the transition of our senior management team  increased legal fees relating to our carriage agreements and depreciation related to our newly opened broadcast facility 
as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  possible subscriber rate relief to our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as programming  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be negatively impacted over the short term future until scale is achieved to reverse the trend 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this is attributable to having obtained two term loans in november with an original aggregate principal amount of  with effective fixed interest rates of and 
we repaid these loans in october and do not expect to incur interest expense in the foreseeable future 

table of contents other income other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased average balances of our investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalents 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was significantly impacted by the  write off of our mso relationship amortizable intangible asset and the additional compensation charges associated with the transition of our senior management including severance and related charges of  and performance unit expense of  additional increased compensation expense resulted from of the adoption of sfas r of  further  we placed our new broadcast facility into service april   which resulted in depreciation expense of approximately additionally  programming costs increased as a result of having launched our second channel  outdoor channel hd  at the beginning of the third quarter of and the planned non airing of certain programs resulting in a write off of their capitalized costs 
also  we incurred incremental expenses in subscriptions and research to support our programming and selling efforts 
offsetting the increased expenses were increases in subscriber fee revenue from deeper penetration of our network with some of our carriers  increased prices charged for the service  increased advertising revenues as a result of increased prices charged to our third party producers and to short form advertisers principally related to the increasing nielsen universe estimate 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to an income tax provision of  for the year ended december  the change was principally due to our incurring a loss in the year ended december  as compared to income generated in the year ended december  and the application of sfas r as it relates to the expensing of and concomitant income tax effect of accounting for share based compensation 
the effective income tax provision benefit was approximately and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to income of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the reasons stated above 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to income of  for the year ended december  net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was a net loss of  a decrease of  compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  the decreases were due to the reasons stated above 
liquidity and capital resources we generated  of cash from operating activities in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  and had a cash and cash equivalent balance of  at 
table of contents december   an increase of  from the balance of  at december  we also had short term investments classified as available for sale securities of  at december   an increase of  from the balance of  at december  the investments at december  were comprised principally of auction rate securities of  with interest rates that generally reset every days 
the auction rate securities have long term maturity dates and provide us with enhanced yields 
various equity securities totaling  make up the remainder of the december  balance 
net working capital increased to  at december   compared to  at december  our investment securities consist of high grade auction rate securities and equity securities 
as of december   our investments included million of high grade aaa aa rated auction rate securities issued primarily by municipalities 
the negative conditions in the global credit markets subsequent to the year end have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings  including their holdings of auction rate securities 
during february and march  we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for of our high grade auction rate securities  representing approximately million 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the issuer or to maturity 
we may experience a similar situation with our remaining auction rate securities 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  until a future auction on these investments is successful  the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
at this time  management has not concluded that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to a number of factors including the receipt of federal and state income tax refunds resulting from our utilization of our net operating loss for both the income tax returns and  as appropriate  carryback opportunities  greater increases in noncash costs and operating expenses as compared to the increase in costs and operating expenses as a whole 
net cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to cash used by investing activities of  for the year ended december  the reduction in cash used in investing activities related principally to the net difference of sales and purchases of short term auction rate securities partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures and equipment related to the build out of our broadcast facility in additional capital expenditures were for fixed asset replacements 
the sale of our membership division provided  of cash from investing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to a use of cash of  for the year ended december  the discontinued operations did not contribute or use cash in financing activities in the year ended december  compared to providing cash of  in the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was principally the proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury stock as employees used stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to vesting of restricted shares 
during the year ended december   cash used by financing activities was principally used to pay off the outstanding debt partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on october   the board of directors approved the renewal of the revolving line of credit agreement the revolver with us bank us the bank  extending the maturity date to september  and increasing the total amount which can be drawn upon under the revolver from  to  interest is payable beginning november   and on the same date of each consecutive month thereafter 
the revolver provides that the interest rate shall be libor plus 
the revolver was previously collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the renewed revolver is unsecured 
this credit facility contains customary financial and other covenants and restrictions  as amended on september   including a change of control provision  some of which are defined with non gaap provisions including elimination of the effects of noncash stock based employee compensation expense 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
this revolver is guaranteed by toc 

table of contents as of december   we had sufficient cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations to meet our short term cash flow requirements 
management believes that our existing cash resources including cash on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations at current levels and anticipated capital requirements through at least december  to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance our working capital requirements or our desire to expand operations beyond current levels  we could seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available if needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating lease obligations principally relate to commitments for delivery of our signal via satellite 
purchase obligations relate to purchase commitments made for the acquisition of programming  advertising and promotion including magazine advertisements and radio show sponsorships  talent agreements  equipment or software maintenance  research services and other operating purchases 
other long term liabilities represent our severance agreement obligation with our former ceo of toc and our compensation commitments with our current ceo under his employment contract 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included available for sale securities of  and  respectively 
at december    of such securities are auction rate securities with long term maturities  but which have variable yields based on auctions that are held every days 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
included within our investment portfolio are aa and aaa rated investments in auction rate securities 
subsequent to december   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
the failure resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at premium interest rates 
while we now earn a premium interest rate on the investments  the investments are not liquid 
in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to until a future auction on these investments is successful 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual
