item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we derive our revenue primarily from sales of bis monitors  our original equipment manufacturer products including bis module kits and the bisx system and related accessories  which we collectively refer to as equipment  and sales of bis sensors 
we have also historically derived a portion of our revenue from our strategic alliances  primarily our alliance with boston scientific corporation  which we terminated in june to assist management in assessing and managing our business  we segregate our revenue by sales by region  sales by products and revenue derived from our strategic alliance  as shown in the following table dollar amounts in thousands domestic revenue percent of total revenue international revenue percent of total revenue total revenue bis sensor revenue percent of total revenue equipment revenue percent of total revenue strategic alliance revenue percent of total revenue total revenue at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we follow a system of fiscal quarters as opposed to calendar quarters 
therefore  the first three quarters of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter and the last quarter of the fiscal year always ends on december we believe our ability to grow our revenue is directly related to our ability to sell our equipment to healthcare organizations and influence our customers after they purchase our equipment to continue to purchase and use our bis sensors 
we believe the primary reason for the growth in product revenue is a direct result of continuing to shift the focus of our sales and marketing emphasis from expanding our customer base to developing our existing customers and increasing their sensor utilization and procedure penetration 
seeking to continue to achieve this growth  we plan to implement new sales and marketing programs  particularly in the area of clinical education programs 
we expect that as we grow our business  revenue from the sale of bis sensors will contribute an increasing percentage of product revenue 
additionally  we believe that  over time  revenue from the sale of bis module kits and our bisx system will increase as a percentage of total equipment revenue as healthcare organizations purchase our technology as part of an integrated solution offered by our original equipment manufacturers 
in order to sustain profitability  we believe that we need to continue to maintain our gross margin and control the growth of our operating expenses 
to maintain our gross profit margin we believe we must continue to focus on maintaining our average unit sales prices of our bis sensors  increasing revenue from the sale of bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue  as bis sensors have a higher gross margin than equipment  and continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing our products 

table of contents for those healthcare organizations desiring to acquire our bis monitors directly from us  we offer two primary options 
our customers have the option either to purchase bis monitors outright or to acquire bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
we also grant these customers an option to purchase the bis monitors at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
under certain limited circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
we have subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom to facilitate the sale of our products into the international market 
we are continuing to develop our international sales and distribution program through a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
we are party to a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
nihon kohden has received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for marketing in japan our a eeg monitor with bis  our a bis monitor  our bis module our product that integrates bis monitoring technology into equipment sold by original equipment manufacturers  our bis xp system and  most recently in december  our bisx and the bis vista monitor 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare granted reimbursement approval for use of our bis monitors 
with this approval  healthcare providers in japan are eligible to receive partial reimbursement of  yen each time bis monitoring is used 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately  and  respectively  of international revenue in  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles bulletin  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  as such  generally recognized no compensation expense for employee stock options 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report for further information regarding our adoption of sfas no 
r 
various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first quarter of and beyond 
these factors include the impact of the shift in our emphasis from expanding our customer base to developing our existing customer base and increasing their sensor utilization and procedure penetration  the continued challenges of the worldwide economy and the risk that we may not realize expected benefits of favorable industry pronouncements on anesthesia awareness  including the position statements issued by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  the american society of anesthesiologists house of delegates  and the american association of nurse anesthetists 
in addition  in japan  nihon kohden received approval of the bis xp system in and we may not recognize the potential benefits of this approval for some time  if at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we do not believe there is a significant likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition we sell our bis monitors primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors 
our original equipment manufacturer products are sold to original equipment manufacturers who in turn sell them to the end user 
bis sensors are sold through a combination of a direct sales force  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
direct product sales are structured as sales  sales type lease arrangements or sales under our ep program 
we recognize revenue when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we also recognize revenue from prepaid license and royalty fees 
this revenue is deferred until product shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of the agreement and license and royalty fees are earned in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements 
in august  we recorded approximately million of deferred revenue related to an oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the oem product development and distribution agreement 
in june  we terminated the oem product development and distribution agreement and as a result we recognized the remaining million that had been previously deferred under this agreement 
in may  we entered into a product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the product development and distribution agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  boston scientific corporation agreed to provide to us up to million to fund the development of products that incorporate eeg analysis technology for the diagnosis of neurological  psychiatric or pain disorders or screening or monitoring patient response to treatment options for such disorders 
in june  we terminated the product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  we reversed a receivable of approximately  which we had recorded in march against the strategic alliance revenue that had originally been recorded in the statement of income 
revenue was being recognized on allowable product development activities pursuant to this agreement as the services were performed and costs were incurred 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for leases  for our sales type lease agreements 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the minimum lease payment  consisting of the additional charge per bis sensor  less the unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  is recorded as the net investment in sales type leases 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
we review and assess the net realizability of our investment in sales type leases at each reporting period 
this review includes determining  on a customer specific basis  if a customer is significantly underperforming relative to the customer s cumulative level of committed bis sensor purchases as required by the sales 
table of contents type lease agreement 
if a customer is underperforming  we record an allowance for lease payments as a charge to revenue to reflect the lower estimate of the net realizable investment in sales type lease balance 
changes in the extent of underperformance in the agreements could increase or decrease the amount of revenue recorded in future periods 
we recognize revenue either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors and original equipment manufacturers in accordance with sab no 
contracts executed for sales to distributors and original equipment manufacturers include a clause that indicates that customer acceptance is limited to confirmation that our products function in accordance with our applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
formal acceptance by the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is not necessary to recognize revenue provided that we objectively demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
each product is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it meets the applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
additionally  we have historically had a minimal number of defective products shipped to distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and any defective products are subject to repair or replacement under warranty as distributors and original equipment manufacturers do not have a right of return 
we exercise judgment in determining the specific time periods in which we can recognize revenue in connection with sales of our products and with respect to our strategic alliances 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition could change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported results 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal  requires that stock based compensation expense associated with equity instruments be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions risk free interest rate the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model 
expected term the expected term of an employee option is the period of time for which the option is expected to be outstanding 
we use a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the expected term assumption for the grant date valuation as we believe that this information is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option 
expected volatility in estimating our expected volatility  we consider both trends in historical volatility and the implied volatility of our publicly traded options 
we used a combination of our implied volatility and historical volatility to estimate expected volatility in the three and months ended december  we believe that in addition to the relevance of historical volatility  consideration of implied volatility achieves the objectives of sfas no 
r since it represents the expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option  and is therefore an appropriate assumption to use in the calculation of grant date fair value 
additionally  we are required to make assumptions regarding the forfeiture rate 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we used a forfeiture rate of approximately in our calculation at december  we re evaluate this forfeiture rate on a quarterly basis and adjust the rate as necessary 
these assumptions involve significant judgment and estimates 
future stock based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount recorded in the current period due to changes in assumptions and due to the extent of stock option activity and restricted stock issued in future periods 

table of contents as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and nonvested restricted stock awards was million and  respectively  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of years and months  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by making estimates and judgments based on our historical collections experience  current trends  historical write offs of our receivables  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
we also review the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  our credit loss rates in the future may not be consistent with our historical experience 
to the extent that we experience a deterioration in our historical collections experience or increased credit losses  bad debt expense would likely increase in future periods 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on production history and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
the medical device industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we would need to change our estimate of the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
if revisions are deemed necessary  we would recognize the adjustments in the form of a charge to costs of revenue at the time of the determination 
therefore  although we continually update our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated declines in demand or technological developments  such as the introduction of new products by our competitors  could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
warranty equipment that we sell generally is covered by a warranty period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on our historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  to the extent we experience an increased number of warranty claims or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty expenses will increase  and we may experience decreased gross profit and cash flow 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
upon adoption of fin  our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes did not change 
we did not accrue interest expense related to these unrecognized tax benefits as due to our historical carryforward loss position  the uncertain benefits have not yet reduced taxes payable and  accordingly  no interest expense has been accrued

income taxes 
our provision for income taxes comprises a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released substantially all of our valuation allowance 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income 
the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of  which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect  apportioned by jurisdiction  in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized 
changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 
as of december   we had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million and state nol s carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates through we also had an additional million of federal and state nol s that are attributable to stock option exercises which will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet once they are realized in accordance with sfas no

as of december   we have used approximately million of these proceeds to repurchase million shares of our common stock  of which million shares were repurchased from boston scientific corporation and million shares were repurchased in connection with our convertible senior note offering that we completed in june on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million under this plan 
we expect to meet our near term liquidity needs through the use of cash and short term investments on hand at december  and cash generated from operations 
we believe that the financial resources available to us  including our current working capital  our long term investments and available revolving line of credit will be sufficient to finance our planned operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources required to further develop our marketing and sales organization domestically and internationally  to finance our research and development programs  to implement new marketing programs  to finance our sales type lease program and to meet market demand for our products and to repay our convertible notes 

table of contents we expect to fund the growth of our business over the long term through cash flow from operations and through issuances of capital stock  promissory notes or other securities 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which could harm the growth of our business 
currently  our convertible senior notes due are convertible  under certain circumstance  solely into shares of our common stock 
however  under the terms of the indenture and such notes  we have the option to settle potential conversions of these notes with cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock  commonly referred to as net share settlement  if we first obtain stockholder approval of this net share settlement feature and we irrevocably elect to use such settlement method 
if we obtain stockholder approval of the net share settlement feature in connection with the potential conversion of such notes and we irrevocably elect to use such settlement method  then upon conversion of such notes we would pay cash in an amount equal to the lesser of one fortieth of the principal amount of the notes being converted and the daily conversion value the product of the conversion rate and the current trading price of the notes being converted and issue shares of our common stock only to the extent that the daily conversion value of the notes exceeded one fortieth of the principal amount of the notes being converted for each trading day of the relevant trading day observation period 
in order to fund the cash payments due upon conversion  we may be required to use a significant portion or all of our existing cash or raise the cash for such payments through the sale of shares of our common stock or additional debt securities or through one or more other financing transactions 
we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to acquire the necessary funds via financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders  or at all  which would result in an event of default under the notes 
moreover  the use of a substantial portion of our existing cash may adversely affect our liquidity and cash available to fund the growth of our business 
working capital at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital from december  to december  was attributable to an increase in our cash and short term investments of approximately million primarily related to proceeds received upon the issuance of million of convertible senior notes due in june offset by our repurchase of approximately million of our common stock and an increase in our deferred tax assets of approximately million 
cash from operations

these were offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately million primarily related to the termination of the oem product development and distribution agreement and the product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation 
we generated approximately million of cash from operations during the three years ended december   which was primarily driven by net income of approximately million and non cash stock based compensation expense of million  offset by the reversal in of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and a decrease in deferred revenue 
cash from investing activities 
we used approximately million of cash in investing activities in the cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of net purchases of investments of approximately million in and the acquisition of property and equipment of approximately million primarily due to spending related to our new facility and the purchase of components for our new automated sensor manufacturing lines 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures in will decrease compared with the level of capital expenditures in we used approximately million for investing activities during the three years ended december  primarily as a result of net purchases of investments of approximately million and acquisition of property  plant and equipment of approximately million 

table of contents cash from financing activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high grade commercial paper  high grade corporate bonds and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with an average maturity of months or less and a maximum maturity of months 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our annual interest income would change by approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at december  and december  would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
our investment in sales type leases and a line of credit agreement are also subject to market risk 
the interest rates implicit in our sales type leases are fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
in addition  the interest rate on the convertible senior notes due is fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate on our line of credit agreement is variable and subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk experienced to date related to the line of credit has been mitigated primarily by the fact that the line of credit  when drawn on  is generally outstanding for short periods of time in order to fund short term cash requirements 
foreign currency exposure most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
the expenses and capital spending of our two international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency and subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our foreign currency transactions are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current period income or loss as 
table of contents incurred 
currently  all material transactions are denominated in us dollars  and we have not entered into any material transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies
