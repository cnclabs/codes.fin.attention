the adjustment results only in a restatement of our balance sheet as of december   reducing both goodwill and long term deferred tax liability by million 

table of contents reorganization on august   our company was reorganized pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization by and among impco  fuel systems  a newly formed delaware corporation  and impco merger sub  inc  a delaware corporation formed solely for the purpose of consummating the reorganization 
the agreement reorganized impco s capital structure into a holding company structure  pursuant to which impco contributed of its holdings of the capital stock of brc to fuel systems  impco became a wholly owned subsidiary of fuel systems  and the stockholders of impco exchanged all of their shares of impco for shares of fuel systems 
nasdaq began listing fuel systems common stock on the nasdaq global market under a new trading symbol  fsys on august  we believe that the reorganization  through the formation of the holding company  fuel systems  with impco and brc being separate  stand alone operating entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of fuel systems  offers several advantages it promotes greater management accountability at the corporate and individual operating unit levels  it creates greater flexibility to respond to customer needs  and it aligns each operating subsidiary with specific core product lines and business segments 
as part of the reorganization  stockholders of impco received one whole share of common stock of fuel systems in exchange for every two shares of impco common stock owned at the time of the reorganization 
stockholders received cash for any fractional shares held equal to a proportionate interest in the gross proceeds of the sale on nasdaq of the aggregate fractional shares 
all outstanding warrants to purchase impco common stock became warrants to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such warrant terms  with any fractional shares treated in accordance with the warrant terms 
all outstanding options to purchase impco common stock became options to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such option  with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number 
the exercise price of the warrants and options following the reorganization became equal to twice the exercise price of such option or warrant immediately prior to the reorganization 
the post reorganization consolidated financial statements of fuel systems presented herein are presented on the same basis as and can be compared to the consolidated financial statements reported in impco s prior quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec 
all share numbers and per share amounts are stated for fuel systems and have given effect to the two for one exchange of impco stock into fuel systems stock that was effected pursuant to the reorganization 
the reorganization transaction is described in detail in the proxy statement prospectus on form s  filed by fuel systems with the sec on july  and declared effective that day 
that filing also includes the full text of the certificate of incorporation of fuel systems 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems to the transportation  industrial and power generation industries on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas  for use in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of distributors and dealers in countries and approximately original equipment manufacturers 
on august   the stockholders of impco adopted the agreement and plan of reorganization pursuant to which impco and brc immediately became separate  stand alone operating entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of fuel systems solutions  inc see reorganization above 
our management believes that the company operates in two business segments  impco operations and brc operations 
under our system of reporting operations  impco operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the industrial market through its us and foreign facilities in the netherlands  australia and japan and distribution channels  including complete certified engines  fuel systems  parts and conversion systems  for applications in the transportation  material handling  stationary and portable power generator markets 
brc operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the transportation market through its italy and foreign facilities in argentina and brazil 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the fuel systems corporate level 
intercompany sales between and within impco operations and brc operations have been eliminated in the results reported 

table of contents we acquired brc on march  and included the results of brc s operations with our consolidated results beginning with the second quarter of and with our balance sheet as of march  as of december   we no longer consolidated our operations in mexico and india as part of our international operations segment 
instead  during we accounted for these operations using the equity method of accounting since we had ownership in these entities and lack effective control over their operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to liquidate our mexico operations and began the process of liquidation in the first quarter of we closed our mexico operations in june we also converted our joint venture in india into independent distributorships in order to reduce the administrative costs of maintaining the joint venture while continuing to sell our products in these markets 
we sold our share in our joint venture in india to the other owner in april net income was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net income of million on revenue of approximately million in operating income decreased by approximately million to million  compared to million for the same period in net income was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net loss of million on revenue of approximately million in operating income increased by approximately million to million  compared to million for the same period in results for the year ended december  includes million in expenses related to our voluntary stock option investigation and related restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements  expenses related to a new brc marketing and advertising campaign which took place during in europe  as well as an increase in the reserve for the loan from brc s joint venture  wmtm 
brc also recorded a million unrealized loss in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during related to the mtm loan with impco us we cannot predict nor assure readers that the operating performance of impco or brc will continue into or be as favorable for future reporting periods or fiscal years 
for future reporting periods or fiscal years  we cannot predict the direction of the movements in foreign exchange which was unfavorable in both and for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in inventory reserve resulting from a specific review of inventory mostly attributed to brc 
brc also recorded a million unrealized loss in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during related to the mtm loan with impco us the net loss for includes an increase in income tax expense of million and million of additional compensation expenses in connection with the extension of the terms of options issued to our former chief executive officer and former chief operating officer for impco 
we also recorded additional provision for slow moving inventory and uncollectible accounts totaling million in our mexico operation reflecting the declining level of business in that market 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for our equity investment in our owned affiliate in mexico  ibmexicano 
we did not believe that there would be adequate cash flows generated from ibmexicano to support its carrying value in our consolidated financial statements 
anticipating the closure and liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary in mexico in the first half of  we wrote off the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of million which had been previously deferred during the course of consolidating our wholly owned mexico subsidiary 
these losses in were partially offset by a strong operating performance by our brc operations in which revenue on a twelve month basis were million or higher than revenue and net income was million or higher over the same period 
our share in these earnings was million and million during and  respectively  or an increase of million 
brc also recorded a million transaction gain in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during recent developments incentive bonus plan in august  our stockholders approved the incentive bonus plan 
under the plan  the compensation committee of our board of directors may grant bonus awards in the form of cash  restricted stock or a combination of both to some or all of impco s and brc s employees based on the divisions profitability and the attainment of individual employee s performance goals 
based on profitability of both impco and brc for  some employees were paid bonuses in may a portion of the bonus was paid in cash and a portion in restricted stock totaling  shares of restricted stock 
the restricted stock vests on the date of the grant and the balance in three equal annual installments 
accordingly  we recorded an expense of million in compensation expense during  of which million relates to the portion of the restricted stock that was fully vested at the date of grant 
based on profitability of both impco and brc for  some employees may be paid bonuses in accordingly  we have recorded an expense of million in compensation expense during of which million relates to the portion of the restricted stock that will fully vest at the date of grant 
relocation of north american headquarters on september   we signed an agreement to sublease a  square foot building  including  square feet of office space  located in santa ana  california  for a term of years beginning september  we relocated our combined corporate headquarters and impco us business operations from our former location in cerritos  california to the santa ana facility 
table of contents in april we believe the new location has sufficient space to modernize and consolidate most of our north american production and component engineering facilities 
we have installed new state of the art production lines  machining  and test equipment in the santa ana facility 
as a global leader in the alternative fuels marketplace  our strategy is to use the improved efficiencies  capabilities and capacity to position us to better serve our markets and to take advantage of new products and new markets 
the annual rent for the santa ana facility is million  which is set to increase every year pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
the terms of the sublease agreement also include rent abatement for the first three months  subject to certain conditions 
in connection with this relocation  we recognized approximately million in expenses during  consisting of approximately million for accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  approximately million for the recognition of incremental rent expense for the santa ana facility prior to the exit of the cerritos facility in early  million for relocation and set up costs and approximately million for the fair value of the remaining lease obligation of the cerritos facility  which extends until during  we incurred million for incremental rent expense for the santa ana facility prior to the exit of the cerritos facility in april and revised the estimated cost for the sublease of the cerritos facility and recorded an additional expense of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in cash outflows including approximately million in leasehold improvements in the new facility 
during  the company incurred million for restoration cost to its former location in cerritos and revised the estimated cost for the restoration resulting in an additional expense of approximately million 
during the year  the company also revised its sublease revenue assumption resulting in an additional expense of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally when products are shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and management believes collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable unless they are secured under an irrevocable letter of credit arrangement guaranteed by a reputable financial institution  and accordingly  we defer such revenue until amounts become due and payable 
the costs of shipping and handling  when incurred  are recognized in the cost of goods sold 
we provide for returns and allowances as circumstances and facts require 
sales to our unconsolidated subsidiaries are made on terms similar to those prevailing with unrelated customers as noted above 
we defer a pro rata portion of the gross profit on sales for the inventory of the unconsolidated subsidiaries until the inventory is sold to a third party customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 

table of contents inventory reserves 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers each subsidiary to be a reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we operate wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
we record goodwill at the time of purchase for the amount of the purchase price over the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the annual reviews performed in the fourth quarters of and resulted in no impairment to goodwill 
intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets acquired if they are determined to have definite useful lives 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology and trade names  are amortized on a straight line basis  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefits  over their estimated reasonable useful lives 
certain other intangible assets such as customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method since the value of customer relationships is expected to decline at a faster rate 
deferred taxes 
based upon the substantial net operating loss carryovers and expected future operating results  we conclude that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets in the united states at december  may not be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total valuation allowance was million as of december  in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to a portion of undistributed earnings of both brc and impco beru technologies bv  impco s operations in the netherlands  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
upon distributions of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we have accrued such residual income taxes for all undistributed foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the income tax impact in the event we repatriate undistributed foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested 
in  we received million as our share of the dividend distributed by impco beru technologies bv for which approximately  was withheld in foreign taxes 
as of december   approximately million in foreign withholding taxes was accrued related to undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
residual us taxes have been accrued applied as a reduction to net operating loss carry forwards on approximately million of earnings of brc for the mtm loan  on approximately million of earnings of impco technologies fuel systems  pty 
limited  the australian subsidiary of impco  for an intercompany transaction and on approximately million of earnings of impcoberu technologies bv for an anticipated dividend 
the respective amounts were deemed to be a constructive dividend creating taxable income for us income tax purposes  upon distribution of earnings in the form of dividends  or otherwise  in excess of these amounts  the company may be subject to united states income taxes 
in addition  the company would be subject to withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
for amounts which have been repaid to brc for the mtm loan  such amounts could be drawn as a dividend from brc in the future without us income tax consequences 

table of contents foreign currency agreements 
we recognize changes in the fair value of a foreign currency agreement as a component of other income and expense on the consolidated statement of operations  unless the agreement qualifies under hedge accounting 
if hedge accounting applies  changes in the fair value of the hedging agreement would be deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as other income and expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  expected stock price volatility  and expected pre vesting option forfeitures 
we base these estimates on historical experience 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our revenue and operating income in thousands revenue years ended december  impco operations brc operations total operating income years ended december  impco operations brc operations corporate expenses total impco operations is a combination of our previously reported us operations and international operations segments

no one country represents more than of total consolidated revenue 
total revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue for was the result of million increase in brc revenue from our operations during the year  as well as an increase of million in revenue from our impco operations 
revenue in the transportation market increased in by million  or  primarily due to brc  which serves the transportation market exclusively 
the industrial market increased by million  or for the year ended december   operating income decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributed to the inclusion of million in expenses related to our voluntary stock option investigation and related restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements 
operating income for impco operations and brc operations improved in as compared to impco operations 
during  revenue increased by approximately million  or  to million  from million during the increase in revenue during was due to a million increase in revenue from the transportation market related to increased in demand in the second half of the year related to energy initiatives effective in australia for liquified petroleum gas or lpg vehicles and a million increase in revenue from the industrial market related to the increase in demand resulting from the new tier iii emission requirements 
operating income for increased by approximately million to million  or of revenues  compared to million in  or revenues 
the increase is due to the increase in revenue discussed above and steady gross margins partially offset by the increase in the sales work force at two of impco s foreign operations to accommodate the growth they are experiencing 
brc operations 
in  brc s revenue was million  an increase of approximately million  or  as compared to the increase in revenue in is due to growth in sales of aftermarket conversion kits in the transportation market  which is driven by increases experienced by consumers in gasoline prices  and has oriented automotive manufacturers to promote gaseous fuel equipment  as well as an increase in sales for delayed oem conversions and sales of kits 
in addition  brc s revenue includes approximately million from zavoli  which we acquired on july  brc s operating income for was million  million higher than in the increase was due to the increase in revenue largely offset by the inclusion of operating expenses related to a new marketing and advertising campaign  which took place during in europe as well as an increase in the reserve for the loan from brc s joint venture  wmtm 
for and  respectively  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million and million for the intangible assets  and approximately million and million for depreciation expense of the step up in fair value of fixed assets related to the acquisition of brc and zavoli 
in future years  the amount of amortization and depreciation will vary due to future changes to the remaining useful lives  movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  and the use of an accelerated amortization schedule for the fair value allocated to customer relationships  however  we estimate that the amount of combined amortization and depreciation during will be approximately million 

table of contents corporate expenses 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the corporate level to support our business segments in areas such as executive management  finance  human resources  management information systems  legal and accounting services  and investor relations 
corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million in the prior year 
corporate expenses in increased from due to expenses of million incurred in primarily for professional fees related to our voluntary stock option investigation and related restatements of our historical consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense and the absence of million of costs associated with the reorganization completed in stock based compensation expense was approximately million and million in and  respectively  resulting from the adoption of sfas r on january  interest income 
interest income was approximately million in and interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in interest expense was due to the higher variable interest rate on our revolving credit facility for impco us operations with lasalle business credit  llc and increased usage of the lasalle credit facility during as compared to resulting from increased worked capital needs to shorten inventory lead times as well as increased costs associated with our voluntary stock option investigation and related restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense 
other income and expense is primarily composed of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses between the us dollar and the euro with respect to marking to market of the mtm loan balance and the gains and losses with respect to the fair value determination of the related foreign exchange hedging agreement since the agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan due to the strengthening of the euro over the u 
s dollar  offset by a gain on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan  offset by a gain on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
we routinely conduct transactions in currencies other than our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we cannot estimate or forecast the direction or the magnitude of any foreign exchange movements with any currency that we transact in  therefore  we do not measure or predict the future impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 
equity share in income of unconsolidated affiliates 
we recognize our share in the income of brc s unconsolidated affiliates 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively 
provision for income taxes

in  income tax expense for our foreign operations was approximately million based on an estimated effective annual tax rate of 
in  income tax expense for our foreign operations was approximately million based on an estimated effective annual tax rate of 
the decrease in tax expense from prior year is attributed to the decrease in pretax earnings in and the decrease in the italian statutory tax rate for brc 
during the years ended december  and  impco us recorded a tax provision of million related to foreign tax withheld on dividends received from our netherlands subsidiary  an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to the amortization of goodwill for income tax purposes that is not offset against the deferred tax asset in the determination of the required valuation allowance  as well as state taxes due 
in  impco us operations also recorded a tax provision of approximately million  which relates to us tax withholding obligations on impco interest payments to mtm under the mtm loan 
we expect to reduce the valuation allowance if we are profitable or provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states if we have additional losses until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets each quarter

for and  respectively  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million and million for the intangible assets and approximately million and million for depreciation of the step up in fair value of fixed assets 
in future years  the amount of amortization and depreciation will vary due to future changes to the remaining useful lives  movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  and the use of an accelerated amortization schedule for the fair value allocated to customer relationships

the increase in corporate expenses is primarily due to an increase in share based compensation expense of million resulting from the adoption of sfas r on january   million in increased costs associated with our reorganization and million in increased costs related to our sarbanes oxley act section compliance efforts to include brc in since brc was not required to be included in our compliance efforts in corporate expenses in included recognition of expense of approximately million in compensation expense related to million stock options granted in prior fiscal years to a former officer and million in severance related costs paid to former officers in as well as a reduction of payroll tax expense  related to our company initiated  voluntary review of our historical stock option grants performed during  of million recognized upon expiration of the related statue of limitations for payroll taxes 
interest income 
interest income was approximately million in and approximately million in the increase is due to higher yields on marketable securities in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in interest expense was due to the higher variable interest rate on our revolving credit facility for impco us operations with lasalle business credit  llc 
in addition  the increase was also due to increased usage on our brc revolving credit facilities used to fund working capital due to growth in the business during as compared to other income and expense 
other income and expense is primarily composed of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses between the us dollar and the euro with respect to marking to market of the mtm loan balance  and the gains and losses with respect to the fair value determination of the related foreign exchange hedging agreement since the agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan due to the strengthening of the euro over the u 
s dollar  offset by a gain on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized gains on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan due to the strengthening of the euro over the u 
s dollar consisting of approximately million recorded in other income and approximately million recorded in equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries offset by a recognized loss on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
we routinely conduct transactions in currencies other than our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we cannot estimate or forecast the direction or the magnitude of any foreign exchange movements with any currency that we transact in  therefore  we do not measure or predict the future impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 
income of equity share in unconsolidated affiliates 
during the year ended december   we recognized our share in the income of brc s unconsolidated affiliates in the amount of million 
since our acquisition of the initial of brc in july  we began accounting for brc s operating results using the equity method whereby we recognized of the earnings of brc in our consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we continued this accounting treatment until we completed the acquisition of the remaining of brc on march  for periods following march   we fully consolidated the results of brc and eliminated all intercompany transactions 
during the first quarter of  we recognized income of approximately million  net of an elimination of an intercompany gain of million  based on million of income reported by brc 
in addition to our share in the earnings of brc  we recognized our share in the losses of our owned joint ventures in mexico and india of approximately million  recorded amortization expense of approximately million of the step up in the fair value of the fixed assets of brc acquired in connection with the initial acquisition in and recorded our share in earnings of brc s unconsolidated affiliates for the nine months ended december  of million 
provision for income taxes 
during  we recognized a tax provision for approximately million as compared to million in the prior year 
in  income tax expense for our foreign operations was approximately million based on an estimated effective annual tax rate of 
for  income tax expense for our foreign operations  excluding mexico operations  was approximately million based on an effective annual tax rate of 
the increase in tax expense from prior year is predominantly attributed to the increase in pretax earnings in and the increase in effective annual tax rate is due to increase in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to brazil and argentina 
impco us operations recorded a tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  of which million is related to foreign tax withheld on dividends received from our netherlands subsidiary  an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to the amortization of goodwill for income tax purposes  that is not offset against the deferred tax asset in the determination of the required valuation allowance  as well as state taxes due 
the remaining million relates to us tax withholding obligations on impco interest payments to mtm under the mtm loan 
we expect to reduce the valuation allowance if we are profitable or provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states if we have additional losses until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets each quarter 
in  impco us operations recorded an increase in the valuation allowance 
table of contents for deferred taxes of approximately million to reserve the carrying value of net deferred tax assets because we determined that the likelihood of recoverability of the net deferred tax asset was less than the more likely than not threshold as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in addition  impco us recorded million primarily related to the usage of net operating losses for amounts deemed to be a constructive dividend creating taxable income for us income tax purposes on earnings of brc for the mtm loan and earnings of impco australia for an intercompany transaction 
liquidity and capital resources 
our ongoing operations are funded by cash generated from operations and debt financings 
in addition  these sources of cash provide for capital expenditures  research and development  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations and prospective new lines of business 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  credit agreements currently  we are party to four significant credit agreements lasalle senior credit facility 
our first significant credit agreement is an asset based credit facility with lasalle business credit  llc  or lasalle  dated july   as amended 
the lasalle senior credit facility matures on june  this revolving credit facility carries an interest rate per annum equal to prime plus  which amounted to per annum at december  and prime plus  or at december   and had a borrowing limit equal to of our eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of million or of our eligible inventory as measured from time to time  subject to reasonable reserves established by lasalle in its discretion 
this lender has a senior security interest in substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
as of december  this facility carried a maximum borrowing limit of million  of which million was the actual borrowing capacity 
on january   the maximum borrowing limit was reduced to million and on march   the borrowing limit on inventory was reduced to the lesser of million or of our eligible inventory subject to a reduction by each week 
at december  our outstanding balance under this loan agreement was million and approximately million was available for borrowing as of that date 
the current financial covenants include  among other things  limits on capital expenditures within any four successive quarters to million for impco us and million for impco world wide operations  and a requirement that we maintain a year to date impco us minimum pre tax loss of not greater than a million loss at any month end beginning january  on march   we announced that our historical consolidated financial statements on or after january  should no longer be relied on 
as a result  we were not compliant with our obligation to provide the lender with current and accurate consolidated financial statements 
lasalle has waived the non compliance resulting from the restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements 
in addition  lasalle waived the financial covenants for each of the fiscal quarters ending march  through and including december  because they may have been impacted as a result of the restatement 
the credit facility expires on june  lasalle has indicated its intent to not renew our credit facility in the long term and they are not willing to extend beyond that date while we transition to a new lender 
without the debt service requirements of the mtm loan  based on impco us s current liquidity and capital needs  impco us expects to be able to repay the amounts owing under the lasalle senior credit facility when the obligation comes due and expects to be able to continue to fund its liquidity and capital needs using cash flows from operations 
however  if impco us does not have sufficient cash flows from operations to repay the amounts owing under the lasalle senior credit facility  lasalle may foreclose on certain of our us assets or take other legal action against us that  alone or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on us 
mtm loan 
our second significant credit agreement is the mtm loan pursuant to which impco borrowed approximately million from mtm on december  the proceeds of the mtm loan were used to retire approximately million of our indebtedness to bison capital structured equity partners llc  an amount that included a prepayment premium and accrued but unpaid interest 
the mtm loan carries a rate equal to above three month euribor per annum  which was at at december  and at december   provided that the rate will increase to above three month euribor after and during the continuance of a default under the mtm loan agreement and to above three month euribor on any unpaid portion of the loan outstanding days after the maturity date of december  beginning on april   the loan is being repaid in quarterly installments  each in the amount of not less than million in the first two years  million in the third year  million in the fourth year and million in the final year  with any remaining unpaid principal and interest to be repaid upon maturity 
the mtm loan and related interest have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the mtm loan provides for automatic acceleration of the amounts borrowed in case of a default due to nonpayment for more than days after the date due or due to the termination of mariano costamagna as our chief executive officer or a 
table of contents material breach of his employment agreement 
the mtm loan also provides for acceleration of the loan upon notice from mtm in case of any other default under the loan 
in addition  the mtm loan contains restrictive covenants limiting our ability to terminate mariano costamagna as our chief executive officer  with certain exceptions for termination upon mr 
costamagna s death  limits impco us from incurring additional debt obligations other than unsecured trade credit  capital leases and additional debt obligations pursuant to the lasalle senior credit facility  limits impco us from merging  consolidating or selling its assets  purchase  retire or redeem our capital stock  and limits impco us from making capital expenditures in excess of million in and subsequent fiscal years 
at december  and april   the amount owed under the mtm loan was approximately million and million  respectively  and we were in compliance with the covenants in the mtm loan and other related terms and conditions 
an event of default under the lasalle senior credit facility would not automatically cause a cross default under the mtm loan 
the mtm loan has significant debt service requirements  which include quarterly payments of million during of which impco us paid the first quarter payment on april  if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing or draw dividends from our subsidiaries  we will not be able to pay the quarterly payments due under the mtm loan 
if impco us were to default on future payments or other terms of the loan agreement  mtm could accelerate the mtm loan causing it to become due in full and or pursue the personal guarantee by mariano costamagna the company s chief executive officer and pier antonio costamagna director of mechanical engineering of mtm  whom are referred to jointly as founders of brc 
the founders of brc have jointly and severally guaranteed impco s performance under the mtm loan because of certain requirements arising under italian law 
in return for their guarantees  we have pledged our equity interest in brc as collateral in the event the guarantee is utilized 
if impco us fails to perform the terms of the mtm loan and messrs 
costamagna are required to fulfill their guarantees  they may require us to reimburse them for their payments as guarantors  or they may take possession of our equity interest in brc  or both 
if they were to take possession of the brc equity interest in total or partial satisfaction of their rights under the pledge agreement  we would lose our rights in the net assets and operations of brc 
this would have a material adverse effect upon our earnings and our financial position 
total assets and net assets for brc operations at december  were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues and operating income for brc was million and million  respectively 
in connection with our continuing non compliance under the lasalle senior credit agreement  lasalle has required that we make no payments to mtm under the mtm loan since july  in order to avoid defaulting on the mtm loan  we have had to borrow additional principal amounts from mtm and use the additional indebtedness to make the required debt service payments 
on december   the board of directors of mtm passed a resolution approving a deferral of the december  principal payment due of million on the mtm loan to march  which was paid on april  the december  interest payment of million was paid in january as of january   impco us owed mtm an additional million in short term debt that was due march  impco us has not yet made this payment as of the date of this filing 
impco us is technically in default on the short term loans  which are not secured or guaranteed 
mtm s italian statutory auditor has advised us that they are not willing to permit extensions on the unsecured short term loans 
to date  mtm has not taken any action to force payment 
mtm borrowings 
on december   mtm entered into a five year unsecured term loan agreement with unicredit banca medio credito spa of italy  our third significant credit agreement  in which mtm received approximately million based on the december  exchange rate of to the euro 
the proceeds of the loan were used for working capital purposes and contributed towards the million loaned to impco on december  the payment terms are such that mtm will pay million on a quarterly basis throughout the term of the loan and interest based on the month euribor rate plus per annum  which was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   the amount outstanding was approximately million 
the loan agreement requires that mtm maintain a debt to equity ratio of less than 
in addition  mtm is required to maintain net assets of at least million based on the exchange rate of on december  at december   mtm was in compliance with these covenants 
brc borrowings

the payment terms are such that brc will pay equal installments on a semi annual basis throughout the term of the loan and interest based on six month euribor rate plus per annum  which was at december  at december   the amount outstanding was million 
the loan agreement requires that brc maintain a ratio of indebtedness to ebita of less than to maintain this rate 
in the event the ratio of indebtedness to ebita exceeds  the effective rate may adjust upward not to exceed six month euribor rate plus 

table of contents other loans brc is also party to two additional credit agreements in and  brc entered into unsecured term loan agreements with the italian ministry of industry for the purpose of funding the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and research and development expenditures 
the loan was paid off in january the loan is repayable in semi annual installments through at a subsidized rate of 
at december   approximately million was owed under the loan 
at december   brc had an unsecured line of credit amounting to approximately million  based on the exchange rate at december   with no outstanding balance 
additionally  brc has up to a million line of commercial credit secured by customer account receivable  based on the exchange rate at december   of which the borrowing capacity was limited to million at december  there was no balance outstanding as of december  interest rates at december  for the unsecured credit facility and the commercial credit facility were three month euribor plus and  respectively  which were and  respectively 
both lines of credit are callable on demand 
other borrowings 
in addition  our subsidiary in the netherlands has a million credit facility based on the exchange rate at december  with fortis bank 
the credit facility is based on account receivables and inventory pledged by our operations in the netherlands and is a daily revocable credit facility 
the interest rate is variable and at december  was 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
liquidity ratios our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  at december   our total working capital had increased by million to million from million at december  this increase is due primarily to the following increase in inventory during of million primarily in brc operations  which increased by million  a million increase in accounts receivable  comparing december  with december   primarily as a result of an increase in brc operations accounts receivable of million partially offset by a decrease in impco operations accounts receivable of million  and increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  which was all partially offset by a decrease in working capital due to an increase of million in accounts payable 
cash flows the restatement of our consolidated financial statements did not result in a change to our previously reported cash flow from operations or total cash and cash equivalents shown in our historical consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in net cash used in operations for cash flows used in operating activities in consisted of net of income of million adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses of million  which included million in amortization of intangible assets acquired and million in depreciation of the step up in fair value of brc s assets compared to million of net income adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses of million in other non cash charges that impacted net income in related to provision for inventory reserve of million and the minority interest in income of consolidated affiliates of million and million in net unrealized loss on foreign exchange transactions  primarily from the net effect of movements between the us dollar and the euro on the mtm loan balance and the fair value adjustment for the foreign currency derivative instrument 
these were partially offset by million in our share in the income of unconsolidated affiliates 
in  other non cash charges that impacted net income included provision for inventory reserve of million and the minority interest in income of consolidated affiliates of million and million in net unrealized loss on foreign exchange transactions  primarily from the net effect of movements between the u 
s dollar and the euro on the mtm loan balance and the fair value adjustment for the foreign currency derivative instruments 
these were partially offset by million in our share in the income of unconsolidated affiliates 
improvements in working capital were due primarily to a million increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a million increase in inventory due our efforts to reduce inventory lead time and a million increase in accounts receivable 
changes in working capital that affected operating cash flows in were a million increase in inventory due the brc acquisition  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in accounts receivable  offset by a million decrease in related party balances 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  million more compared to the million used in the increased amount in was due to the acquisition of zavoli for million  net of cash acquired of million 
higher purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements in were related to the relocation of the impco operations and north american headquarters in 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities in was million or a decrease of million from million provided by financing activities in this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in utilization of revolving lines of credit in the amount of million in  down from an increase in the utilization of million in and decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options to million in  down from million in partly offsetting the decrease were million net proceeds from intesa san paolo spa loan in june  the proceeds of which were used to purchase zavoli  srl our existing capital resources together with cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to fund our worldwide operations for the next months 
however  there are differences in the liquidity and cash flow needs of our two operating segments  brc operations brc and impco operations impco 
our existing capital resources together with cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to fund brc for the next months 
in addition  with respect to impco  our existing capital resources together with cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to fund our international operations of impco for the next months 
however  the us operations of impco  or impco us  bears the majority of our corporate expenses and has significant debt service requirements under the mtm loan and the lasalle senior credit facility 
while impco us s existing capital resources together with cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to fund operations including the payment of the lasalle senior credit facility for the next months  impco us does not have sufficient resources to make its debt service payments under the intercompany mtm loan 
if impco us is unable to obtain additional or replacement financing  draw dividends from its subsidiaries or obtain additional investments from fuel systems through financing through fuel systems or dividends from brc  impco us will not be able to pay the quarterly payments due under the intercompany mtm loan 
the amount outstanding on the mtm loan as of april  was million 
the mtm loan has significant debt service requirements  which include quarterly payments of million during of which impco us paid the first quarter payment on april  if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing or draw dividends from our subsidiaries  we will not be able to pay the quarterly payments due under the mtm loan

if they were to take possession of the brc equity interest in total or partial satisfaction of their rights under the pledge agreement  we would lose our rights in the net assets and operations of brc 
this would have a material adverse effect upon our earnings and our financial position 
total assets and net assets for brc operations at december  were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues and operating income for brc was million and million  respectively 
impco us has historically depended on borrowings under our lasalle senior credit facility to fund our liquidity and capital needs 
in the last months we have had to seek multiple waivers and amendments from lasalle in order to prevent an event of default and acceleration of the indebtedness under the agreement 
lasalle has indicated that they do not intend to amend the financial covenants any further or grant additional or continuing waivers in the future 
furthermore  the lasalle senior credit facility is currently scheduled to expire on june  lasalle has indicated its intent to not renew our credit facility in the long term and they are not willing to extend beyond that date while we transition to a new lender  and we may not be able obtain a replacement credit facility from another lender 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the lasalle senior credit facility was million 
as of march   the balance outstanding on the lasalle senior credit facility was million 
without the debt service requirements of the mtm loan  based on impco us s current liquidity and capital needs  impco us expects to be able to repay the amounts owing under the lasalle senior credit facility when the obligation comes due and expects to be able to continue to fund its liquidity and capital needs using cash flows from operations

mtm s italian statutory creditor has advised us that they are not willing to permit extensions on the unsecured short term loans 
to date  mtm has not taken any action to force payment 
for periods beyond months  we may seek additional financing to fund future operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or through agreements with corporate partners with respect to the development of our technologies and products 
however  we offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of fluctuations in our sales volumes or margins  costs related to the results of our review of our historical stock option grants or other factors identified in item a risk factors 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
on january   our then owned affiliate  brc initiated a foreign exchange forward contract for the purpose of hedging against foreign currency devaluations that might occur in the future between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the december  million loan made between impco and mtm  a subsidiary of brc 
this hedging agreement was not designed to hedge the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to foreign currency movements that occur from time to time that could impact the our consolidated financial results either favorably or unfavorably 
we concluded that this agreement did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  we recognized gains of approximately million and million for and  respectively  which are classified on the consolidated statements of operations as part of other income expense 
we have recorded the fair value of this derivative  which amounted to an approximately million asset at december  foreign currency management 
the results and financial condition of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the us dollar 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased as a result of the growth of our international subsidiaries 
the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency of the subsidiary 
an increase in the value of the us dollar increases the costs incurred by our subsidiaries  as most of our international subsidiaries inventory purchases are us dollar denominated  and thus the cost of our products  adversely affecting our competitiveness and profitability 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies and  when deemed appropriate  the use of forward currency contracts 
on december   impco entered into a million loan agreement with mtm in which mtm recorded a related party receivable on its books for million and impco recorded a corresponding related party liability on its books for the same amount 
under the agreement  the loan will be settled in us dollars 
mtm  an italian company  records transactions on its books using the euro as its reporting currency 
brc records the foreign exchange effect of carrying the mtm loan on its books  as well as other assets and liabilities to be settled in a currency other than the euro  even though this loan was being eliminated for financial reporting purposes beginning with the balance sheet at march  for the years ended december  and  we recognized unrealized loss on foreign exchange of approximately million and million  respectively  on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized gain on foreign exchange of approximately million on our statement of operations of which million is reported as part of other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and million in equity share in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
we measured the impact on our statement of operations of a hypothetical increase and a decrease of the spot rate of the euro to the us dollar based on a starting point of dollars to the euro as of december  applied to the loan balance of million and determined that a strengthening or weakening of the euro to the dollar would result in a pre tax loss or gain  respectively  on foreign exchange on mtm s books of approximately million 
we seek to hedge our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our us dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
the term loans are denominated in local currencies and translated to us dollars at period end exchange rates 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements

table of contents our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro 
on january   brc entered into foreign exchange forward contracts covering a three year period for the purpose of hedging the foreign exchange risk between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the quarterly payments made by impco to brc under the terms of the mtm loan 
this agreement was not designed to hedge the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to foreign currency movements that occur from time to time that could impact our consolidated financial results either favorably or unfavorably 
we concluded that this agreement did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  we recognized million in gains and million in losses for and  respectively  which are classified on the consolidated statements of operations for each year as part of other income expense 
as of december  and december   the notional amounts of the foreign exchange forward contracts were million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  and december   were a million asset and a  liability  respectively 
as of december   we had one remaining contract under this agreement that matured on january  upon maturity  we recognized a realized gain of million  which approximated the recorded fair value of the derivative asset at december  we also recognize foreign exchange gains and losses in relation to the mtm loan  which had carrying values of million and million at december  and  respectively 
brc recognizes gains and losses on a mark to market basis of this loan balance on its books because the loan will be settled in us dollars and brc maintains its records in its reporting currency  the euro
