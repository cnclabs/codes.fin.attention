results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations for the year ended june  increased by  to  from  for the year ended june  this result was the net effect of a increase in wholesale revenue  an decrease in retail sales  and a decrease in domestic franchise revenue 
each component of total revenue is discussed below 
wholesale revenue 
our wholesale sales for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  wholesale sales to ocs and other third party wholesale sales increased  or to  led by strong growth in the keurig k cup sales which increased by or  from the prior year 
roasted coffee sales to franchisees decreased  for the year ended june  primarily because of a net decrease of same store sales along with a net decrease of retail stores during fiscal for the gloria jean s domestic franchise system which reduced roasted coffee usage 
franchise revenue 
our domestic franchise revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  our franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees  franchise renewal fees  area development fees and royalties received on sales at franchised locations 
of the decrease in domestic franchise revenue   of the decrease resulted from a decrease in royalty income and was due to a net decrease in same stores sales of or  for the gloria jean s brand in the current year compared to fiscal the balance of the decrease of  was due to fewer new franchise store openings and renewal fees compared to the prior year 
retail sales 
our retail sales revenue for the year ended june  decreased by a net  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of company operated stores during the current year along with a decrease in same store sales of for gloria jean s which was offset by an increase in same store sales for diedrich of compared to the prior year 
sales from our retail internet website increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
as a percentage of total revenue  cost of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal because none of these costs relate to franchise revenue  the most relevant benchmark of these costs is their relationship to total retail and wholesale sales 
using that measure  cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased as a percentage of total retail and wholesale sales from in fiscal to in fiscal retail cost of sales increased from to in the current year whereas wholesale cost of sales increased from to of wholesale sales in fiscal due to a higher percentage of higher cost keurig business in the current year 
wholesale sales that carry a higher cost of goods sold than retail sales also increased as a percentage of the retail and wholesale sales mix from to 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the year ended june  decreased  and as a percentage of total revenue  decreased from in fiscal to in the current year 
this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in retail and franchise operating costs of  and  respectively 
the operating expenses decrease was offset by an increase in wholesale operating costs of  the decrease in retail operating costs of  resulted from a  net decrease in costs associated with fewer retail 
table of contents stores offset by an increase of  in labor and marketing costs associated with the internet business 
franchise operating expense decreased by  and primarily resulted from a decrease in compensation of  marketing of  and legal  consulting and other of  and was partially offset by an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts of  operating costs for wholesale increased  and was primarily related to a decrease in compensation costs of  associated with a reduction in headcount for wholesale food service 
this decrease in wholesale operating costs was offset by increases in allowance for doubtful accounts of  marketing of  outside services of  and other costs of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased  or to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  and was primarily the result of an increase in capital improvements at our castroville roasting facility 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase in general administrative expenses was due primarily to legal costs and settlement reserves of  along with  of costs associated with legal and consulting fees surrounding strategic planning and analysis 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in compensation costs of  primarily in bonus accruals along with decreases in insurance and other costs of  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal provision for goodwill and asset impairment 
we recorded an impairment charge of  during fiscal year to fully impair goodwill associated with our wholesale and franchise operations of  and  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal we recorded an asset impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value associated with four of our gloria jean s company owned coffeehouses 
during fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value associated with four of our gloria jean s coffeehouses and three diedrich coffeehouses 
interest expense and interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net less interest expense totaled  for the year ended june  while interest and other income  net less interest expense totaled  for the year ended june  this change of  was primarily due to a net decrease in interest expense associated with borrowings on our credit facility during the current fiscal year compared to the prior year 
income tax benefit 
we had losses from continuing operations for the years ended june  and june  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 the income tax benefit generated by the loss from continuing operations were  and  for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
as of june  net operating loss carryforwards of  and  for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively are available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal  subject to annual limitation pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences  and thus has recorded a valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset balance 
results of discontinued operations retail 
as a result of the sale and closure of certain retail stores during the fiscal year  the results from this component of our business are presented as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june  in accordance with sfas no 
for the year ended june   gain on sale from discontinued operations was  net of  in taxes 
for the year ended june   net income from discontinued operations was  net of  in taxes  including a gain of  net of  in taxes 
for fiscal year ended june   the tax expense associated with the discontinued retail operations differed from the statutory federal effective tax rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and permanently nondeductible goodwill associated with the discontinued operations 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity and capital resources current financial condition at june   we had working capital of  long term tax liabilities  deferred rent and deferred compensation of  and  of stockholders equity  compared to working capital of  total deferred rent and deferred compensation of  and  of stockholders equity at june  the decrease in working capital of  in the current fiscal year resulted primarily from current year losses from continuing operations of  the losses from continuing operations included a charge of  for the impairment of the company s goodwill from its wholesale and franchise operations along with an asset impairment to reduce the carrying value associated with four of our gloria jean s coffeehouses 
cash flows the following is a summary of our cash flows for each of the two years ended june  and june  june  june  cash flows used in operating activities net loss loss from discontinued operations  net gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net net loss from continuing operations net non cash charges to income net increase in operating assets net increase decrease in operating liabilities cash flows used in continuing operating activities cash flows used in discontinued operations cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinuing operations cash flows provided by financing activities of continuing operations cash flows used in financing activities of discontinuing operations net increase decrease in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year capital commitments at end of year the changes in cash from continuing operations in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are more fully enumerated in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company has incurred losses from continuing operations of  and  for the and fiscal years  respectively 
net cash used in continuing operations of  for fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase in accounts payable  of which was primarily attributable to the increased working capital needs due to a increase in revenue from our wholesale business compared to fiscal since the terms of our wholesale sales are credit  an increase in wholesale sales results in an increase in accounts receivable 
increase in our wholesale business also requires us to carry higher inventory to meet market demand 
for fiscal  cash used in continuing operations was  and was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as our wholesale business grew by over fiscal 
table of contents cash flow used in operating activities of discontinued operations in and of  and  respectively  were primarily the result of the closure of retail stores and of losses in our retail operations before the sale transaction in fiscal year cash flows used by investing activities of continuing operations during fiscal totaled  during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled  and was used to invest in property and equipment primarily related to our castroville roasting facility of  wholesale of  retail stores of  and our home office facility of  these expenditures were partially offset by  of payments received on notes receivable 
during fiscal  a total of  was used to invest in property with    and  spent on our roasting facility  wholesale business  retail and home office facility 
these expenditures were primarily offset by  of payments received on notes receivable 
cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations for and of  and  respectively  were primarily the result of the sale of diedrich coffee and coffee people retail stores to starbucks and other third parties in net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal of  was primarily the result from borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations for of  was primarily the result from the exercise of employee stock options during the fiscal year 
outstanding debt and financing arrangements on may   we entered into a  contingent convertible note purchase agreement with sequoia enterprises  lp sequoia  a limited partnership whose sole general partner also serves as the chairman of the board of directors of the company the note purchase agreement  which provided  at our election  the ability to issue notes with up to an aggregate principal amount of  we have amended the note purchase agreement from time to time and have agreed to refrain from further borrowings under the note purchase agreement in connection with the entry into the loan agreement as defined below entered into on august  as amended  the notes issued under the note purchase agreement are due in full on march  interest is payable at three month libor plus  and a facility fee of annually is payable on the unused portion of the facility 
the note purchase agreement contains covenants  among others  that limit the amount of indebtedness that we may have outstanding in relation to our tangible net worth 
as of june   we had  of issued notes outstanding under the note purchase agreement 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the note purchase agreement  as amended 
pursuant to the original terms of the note purchase agreement  as amended  we previously issued  warrants to sequoia  which were outstanding as of june   and a total of  warrants were issuable to sequoia upon a change in control for previous debt repayments under this facility 
these warrants were cancelled in connection with the entry into the loan agreement and the issuance of the sequoia warrant as defined below  and no further warrants shall be issued under the note purchase agreement to sequoia  as described below 
pursuant to the original terms of the note purchase agreement  as amended  the note balance was convertible into common stock of the company 
the amendment on august  provided that all notes issued under the note purchase agreement are no longer convertible into common stock of the company 
on august   we entered into an amendment no 
to the warrant  amendment no 
to the note purchase agreement and cancellation of note purchase warrant collectively  the amendment 
the amendment extended the maturity date of the note purchase agreement and the notes issued thereunder until march  and reflected the agreement by sequoia that we are only required to make monthly payments of interest and the monthly commitment fee  but not principal  until such date 
on the maturity date  all outstanding principal  interest and other amounts payable under the note purchase agreement will be due unless due earlier pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement upon a change of control of the company or an event of 
table of contents default 
the amendment also modified the definition of change of control contained in the note purchase agreement such that the acquisition of a third party other than the current chairman of the company s board of directors and entities controlled by him of or more of the voting equity of the company will constitute a change of control 
previously  the threshold was 
lastly  the amendment changed the exercise price of the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of the company issued to sequoia on may  the sequoia warrant  to per share  subject to adjustment as provided in the sequoia warrant and the related registration rights agreement 
previously  the exercise price was per share  subject to adjustment 
loan agreement on august   we entered into a new loan agreement with sequoia the loan agreement 
the loan agreement provides for a million term loan the term loan 
the term loan accrues interest from the funding date at libor plus  resetting on the first calendar day of each month 
the company is required to make regular monthly payments of interest  and to cause the principal amount to be reduced to million no later than august  all outstanding principal and interest will be due on the maturity date of august   unless due earlier pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement upon a change of control of the company or an event of default

the loan agreement also contains a covenant that limits the amount of indebtedness that the company may have outstanding in relation to tangible net worth  in addition to other standard covenants and events of default 
the term loan is senior to all other indebtedness of the company  except indebtedness pursuant to notes under the note purchase agreement and certain permitted indebtedness identified in the loan agreement 
upon repayment of the notes under the note purchase agreement  the term loan will be senior to all other indebtedness of the company  except such permitted indebtedness 
in connection with the loan agreement and the amendment  on august   we issued to sequoia a warrant the sequoia warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share  which represented a premium of  or approximately  over the closing price of the company s common stock on such date 
letter of credit in addition  we entered into a credit agreement with bank of the west on november  the agreement provides for a  letter of credit facility that expires on october  the letter of credit facility is secured by a deposit account at bank of the west 
as of june   this deposit account had a balance of  which is shown as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of june    of letters of credit was outstanding under the letter of credit facility 
the agreement contains covenants that  among other matters  require us to submit financial statements to the bank within specified time periods 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all bank of the west agreement covenants 
liquidity and management plans we incurred a net loss of million which included a million non cash charge for asset impairment and reported net cash used in operating activities of million during the year ended june  we had a cash balance of  and no ability to access credit under our note purchase agreement as of june  the note purchase agreement expires on march  and the million balance on the note is due in full on that date 
as described above  we have obtained the term loan in an amount of million on august  we have obtained commitments from our lender sequoia  to extend the maturity date of the million note due under the note purchase agreement and provide additional financing as required 

table of contents in addition  our management has also been working on improvements in several areas that we believe will improve cash flow from operations product pricing order fulfillment rates outbound freight costs packaging and portion size production efficiency material handling and storage costs inventory carrying costs our management has developed the annual operating plan for the fiscal year and we expect a return to profitability and to generate positive cash flow in the year ahead 
we have taken steps to shift focus of our available resources towards strengthening of the wholesale business segments in order to sustain our projected growth in fiscal however  there is no assurance that we will return to profitability or generate positive cash flow 
our management believes that cash flow from operations  funds available to us from our credit agreements and additional lending commitments obtained from our lender sequoia will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs at the anticipated operating levels for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the extent and timing of the rate at which our business grows  if at all  with corresponding demands for working capital 
we may be required to seek additional funding through either debt financing  or equity financing or a combination of funding methods to meet our capital requirements and sustain our operations 
however  additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
commitments and contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases green coffee commitments note payable at june   the company had capital commitments of  comprised of  for our roasting facility and  for corporate 

table of contents we have also entered into an employment agreement with one executive that provides for a severance payment of nine months salary in the event that this individual is terminated without cause 
our maximum liability for severance under this contract is currently  because such amount is contingent  it has not been included in the above table 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are liable on the master leases for franchised locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  which typically pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible for making payments thereunder 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at june   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord that is less than the sum of all remaining future rents and other amounts payable 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance and workers compensation reserves  store closure reserves  stock based compensation  the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion  however  does not list all of our accounting policies and estimates 
impairment of property and equipment and other amortizable long lived assets held and used each quarter  or upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined in sfas no 
 we evaluate the carrying value of individual stores when the operating results have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or a current expectation that a store will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the store was opened or remodeled  and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
for stores selected for review  we estimate the future cash flows from operating the store over its estimated useful life 
we make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has likely occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the segment level since the components within each segment have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the segment 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the segments may ultimately prove to be significantly higher or lower  thereby causing the carrying value to be less than or to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has or has not occurred 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be understated or overstated 
our annual impairment measurement date is our fiscal year end 
we fully impaired our goodwill as of june  estimated liability for closing stores we make decisions to close stores based on prospects for estimated future profitability and sometimes we are forced to close stores due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our management team evaluates each store s performance every period 
when stores continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of an unprofitable store 
based on the management team s judgment  we estimate the future net cash flows 
if we determine that the store will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow 
table of contents or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the store  we may close the store 
additionally  franchisees may close stores for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish an estimated liability for the closed store if we decide not to operate it as a company operated store 
effective january   we established the estimated liability on the actual closure date which is generally the date on which we cease to receive economic benefit from the unit 
we also review the net cash flows to determine the need to provide for asset impairment 
the estimated liability for closing stores on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee that we expect to pay  as well as the estimated maintenance costs that we expect to pay until the lease has been abated 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing stores is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant stores  which we determine based on our assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with the lessors or to sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant stores are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant stores are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities through the line item in which it was originally recorded  resulting in an increase in operating income 
estimated liability for self insured workers compensation we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation insurance for policy years ended prior to october we obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims with a  deductible per occurrence and a program maximum for all claims of  insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of incurred and unpaid losses 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
management  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
as a result  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims are greater than expected  then we may adjust the expected losses upward and our future self insurance expenses will rise 
franchised operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each period we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
over time  our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had franchisees for whom we had estimated a loss equal to the total amount of their receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise stores by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement  which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future  a restructuring of the franchisee s business or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary or secondary obligee or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on stores operated by franchisees for which we are the primary or secondary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the store 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing stores above 
consistent with sfas no 
 we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised stores 
in addition  entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
stock based compensation as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of stock 
prior to june   we elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no

r  share based payment sfas no 
r which sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees and non employee directors  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including our historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies as discussed above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
if we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not  we would then reverse our valuation allowance and credit income tax expense 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from future taxable income 
as of june   our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance totaled approximately

other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business experiences some variations in sales from quarter to quarter due to the holiday season and other factors including  but not limited to  general economic trends  competition  marketing programs and the weather
