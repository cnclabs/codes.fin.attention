we conduct business in one operating segment 
we develop  market and sell software solutions that secure digital identities and information 
we also perform professional services to install  support  and integrate our software solutions with other applications 
all of these activities may be fulfilled in conjunction with partners and are managed through our global organization 
as an innovator and pioneer in the internet security and public key infrastructure pki fields  entrust s market leadership and expertise in delivering award winning identity and data protection management software solutions is demonstrated by the diversity of its products  geographic representation  and customer segments 
we continue to drive revenue in our key products 
we have three key layered approaches that we take to our customers  our layered consumer  enterprise and government security architectures 
these layered approaches to security help give our customers a roadmap for building security across their enterprise and customer facing applications  and for governments  citizens facing applications 
the layered approach allows our customers to customize the level of security to the value of the data or transaction 
a layered security strategy from a single  trusted vendor affords security conscious organizations a level of synergy  interoperability and cost effectiveness unmatched by a collection of third party products 
further  layered security models foster environments of easy to use security solutions that increase end user acceptance and reduce help desk calls 
entrust has attractive capabilities in the market to assist our customers with their growing identity and information protection needs 
our layered consumer architecture approach consists of six layers extended validation ev ssl certificates versatile authentication single sign on sso fraud detection risk based authentication transaction signing encryption secure web e mail open fraud intelligence network our layered enterprise architecture approach consists of five layers workstation network authentication 
table of contents ssl  unified communications certificates remote access authentication secure shared folders secure boundary end to end messaging entrust has three key platforms  authentication and transaction monitoring  information protection and public key which support our layered security architectures 
we have a unique end to end platform for securing digital identities and information 
this end to end software platform is easy to implement  user friendly and cost effective with the ability to evolve over time to grow with our customers needs 
authentication and transaction monitoring  come together in to provide a new level of assurance for both internal and external parties  through risk based authentication 
entrust offers a range of authentication capabilities with its authentication platform so that specific methods can be used with specific users and applications 
first steps can be as simple as deploying ssl certificates or user name and password 
entrust has long played a key role in this space through our ssl and single sign on products 
risk based authentication  however  goes much deeper than ssl and single sign on 
risk based authentication has the ability to judge each individual transaction on its own merits driven by policy level decisions on the level of risk associated with certain transactions 
with entrust s risk based authentication solution  transactions can be monitored in real time and then a determination can be made on the level of security required for that transaction 
this is done through the combination of entrust identityguard and entrust transactionguard 
this combined offering is a modern architecture for consumer authentication which has a layered approach of non invasive anomaly detection and selective intervention with minimal impact on the user experience 
product category financial metrics entrust emerging growth products accounted for million of product revenue for q  for the full year  emerging growth product revenue accounted for of total product revenue 
entrust pki products accounted for million of product revenue for q  for the full year  pki product revenue accounted for of total product revenue and increased over entrust single sign on products accounted for million of product revenue for q  for the full year  single sign on product revenue accounted for of total product revenue 
these three categories are how we report our product revenue externally  but do not directly correlate to our three platforms that we use with customers 
we also provide support and maintenance services to our customers 
support and maintenance revenue made of nearly two thirds of our total services revenues in q of  achieving record high levels 
it is important to note that we achieved record renewals in the fourth quarter of  both in terms of customer retention rate and the dollar value of retention 
the customer retention rate and the associated dollar value renewals were over percent in we also provide professional services  including architecture  installation  and integration services related to the products that we sell 
our support and maintenance  and our professional services have shown consistent steady growth and  since q  have achieved quarters of sequential quarter over quarter revenue growth 
in  deferred revenue increased million to million from year end the increase in deferred revenue was driven by an increase in subscription product bookings of the increase and support and maintenance renewals 
these numbers show the continued strength of our support and maintenance renewals and the growth in our subscription based software growth 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  entrust achieved a net income of per share  which is an improvement of per share from a net loss of per share in the fourth quarter of during we have significantly reduced our total expenses through a combination of managed headcount reductions lowering of contracting expenses and controlling variable operating costs 
those expense reduction initiatives were somewhat offset by the additional costs we are experiencing due to the appreciation of the canadian dollar from approximately 
per us dollar at the beginning of the year to per us dollar exchange rate at the end of this increase in the canadian dollar to the us dollar cost entrust nearly million in additional expense in entrust sells its solutions globally  with an emphasis on north america  europe and asia 
these primary areas have demonstrated the most potential for early adoption of the broadest set of entrust solutions 
entrust extends to other non core geographies through strategic partner relationships  which increases the leverage of our direct sales channel worldwide 
in north america  entrust is targeting a return to revenue growth in its software business by leveraging entrust s historical strength in selling to key verticals such as government federal  state  provincial  financial services and global enterprises 
europe and the middle east are regions where entrust s products and solutions continue to experience strong demand and we believe that this market will provide growth  with increased momentum from governments and enterprises leveraging entrust s solutions to transform their business processes and to leverage the internet and networking applications 
we market and sell our products and services in both the enterprise and government market space 
in q   of our product sales were in our extended government vertical market  which includes healthcare 
for the year of product revenue was driven by extended government customers around the world 
this revenue has been driven by key global projects that have started to increase product purchases 
in the extended government vertical market  we have a strong penetration in the us federal government  the governments of canada  singapore  denmark  the united kingdom  kingdom of saudi arabia and across continental europe 
in fact  entrust now counts of the top e governments  as set forth in a report of accenture issued in june  as customers 
a key change in the government space has been the movement from purely internal security solutions that our customers require to more external citizen facing applications 
these projects include epassports  national id programs  eborders  physical and logical access programs for government employees  and a growing number of citizen facing applications 
security is at the core of all these projects and our wide product set positions entrust well in this space 
we have already announced six epassport projects that entrust has won and we have been selected as the infrastructure for a number of national id and ministry of defense programs 
in we won national pki infrastructures in the kingdom of saudi arabia  brunei and slovenia 
specifically  we had one million dollar transaction in the rd quarter for the saudi arabia pki infrastructure and in the fourth quarter their eportal infrastructure was our largest transaction 
in q   of our product sales were in our extended enterprise vertical market 
we continue to see demand from global enterprises as they continue to respond to regulatory and governance compliance demands and extend their internal and external networks to more and more individuals inside and outside their domain 
we have experienced a change in the shape of many enterprise deals 
specifically  enterprises are buying for their immediate need and then adding to their purchases as the projects begin roll out 
our largest vertical within the enterprise market is the financial services vertical 
in the fourth quarter of  financial services accounted for of product revenue 
although financial services remain our second largest vertical our revenue from this vertical was impacted by financial institutions exposure to sub prime issues in the second half of we did have very good success in the financial vertical in chile  where we won nine banks with our risk based authentication solution in the fourth quarter 
a key driver of our product growth has been the recent spotlight on identity theft due to breaches at companies like choicepoint  lexisnexis and tjx 
these breaches have proven that self regulation over the past 
table of contents few years has been insufficient at addressing the underlying issues 
recent legislation has addressed these concerns 
california sb has cast more visibility on the issue for citizens  corporations  and the government 
the law requires both corporations and the government to notify california residents if their sensitive data has been breached unless encryption technology is deployed 
additionally  more than states have now passed breach notification requirements 
entrust for years has been a leader in securing digital identities and information 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced identityguard which is our easy to use second factor of authentication solution 
in q   identityguard product revenue was million  its highest level of the year 
entrust identityguard transactions increased to in  up  from in new customer acquisition was strong in with of the transactions coming from new customers 
as of december   we have over million licensed users of identityguard and have gone over million in total sales of the solution 
identityguard s low cost point  its simplicity for the mass market  and its effectiveness in countering online theft and phishing  are the key drivers for the increased revenue growth we are experiencing 
along with the revenue growth for second factor authentication  we are also seeing customers increasingly interested in data protection and encryption 
with a combination of entrust identityguard  getaccess and truepass  customers can accomplish authentication and role based access control  digital signature  and encryption from one solution provider 
in the first quarter of  entrust introduced the industry s first one time passcode otp security token 
in the second quarter  we made the product commercially available and delivered our tokens to our first customers 
in addition to the otp token  entrust identityguard customers enjoy a range of authentication methods from a single platform 
this provides unprecedented flexibility and choice customers currently do not have with existing otp token vendors 
in april  entrust introduced a managed public key infrastructure pki service 
this service was launched in response to customer requests for entrust to offer a hosted service to give them a choice between a service offering for pki certificates and our traditional pki software purchase option 
our service offering is designed to help enterprises and government agencies grow and accelerate their core business security  without having to develop pki expertise internally 
in december  the entrust managed pki service made the general services administration gsa list of approved shared service providers 
this status enables entrust to help federal agencies reap the security benefits of pki without having to maintain the certification authority ca themselves 
in q   we became the primary supplier for the us federal government s general services administration hspd directive 
our managed service is not our first entrance into the services business 
we have been helping our customers for years design  deploy and manage our solutions 
we have also been successful in growing our ssl certificate business  which increased over in the fourth quarter over last year and increased for the full year 
with the introduction of the new extended validation ssl certificates and unified communications certificates we should be able to grow this business into entrust in the past has relied significantly on large deals  meaning deals of million or more  in each quarter 
we have over the past few years reduced this dependence  but they remain a significant portion of our product revenue on a quarterly basis 
our software revenue from our top five customers in q  was approximately of our total revenue in that quarter and we did not have a product deal over million in the quarter 
these numbers were slightly outside our historical range  which is generally between and of revenue from the top five customers and zero to four transactions over million 
in  nearly percent of our product revenue came from transactions under thousand 
this shift in our business model to more  smaller transactions has reduced our dependence on deals over thousand 
we continue to be impacted from time to time on our software revenue by the timing of our customers buying process  which may include proof of concepts  senior management reviews and budget delays that 
table of contents sometimes results in longer than anticipated sales cycles 
we are also impacted by our customers recent buying behavior  which is to buy only for immediate need as opposed to making a larger purchase in order to get a better discount 
any of these factors may impact our revenue on a quarterly basis 
our management uses the following metrics to measure performance number and average size of product revenue transactions  number of deals over million and thousand  top five product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues  product revenue split between extended enterprise and extended government verticals  product revenue split between three key product areas emerging growth markets  public key infrastructure and single sign on  geographic revenue split  product and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues  and deferred revenue  cash and cash equivalents  and accounts receivable 
business overview during  we continued our strategy of focusing on core vertical and geographic markets 
revenues of million represented a increase over  and consisted of product sales and services and maintenance 
services and maintenance revenues increased over  due to increased demand for both consulting services and support and maintenance services  while product revenues increased from  primarily driven by an improved product transaction closure rate  despite a lower average purchase value for product transactions compared to net loss in was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in  with total expenses decreasing to million in  due in part to a million adjustment to our restructuring accrual related to our california facility in we used million in cash flow from operations in  compared to net cash generated in operations of million in entrust emerging growth products entrust identityguard  boundary messaging and fraud detection accounted for of product revenue  which is a decrease of from entrust pki products accounted for of product revenue  which is an increase of from entrust ssl certificate services revenues  a component of our pki product solutions suite  increased over entrust single sign on products accounted for of product revenue  which is a decrease of from overall  extended government accounted for and extended enterprise accounted for of the product revenue in the financial services vertical accounted for approximately of product revenues  a decrease of from other highlights from included the top five product transactions accounted for of revenues  compared to in the average purchase size in was  which was a decrease from  in total transactions in reached  which is up from transactions in we added new customers in  compared to new customers in  an increase of 
deferred revenue was million  which is an increase of from nearly of the increase from came from product related bookings 
entrust identityguard transactions increased to in  up  from transactions in new customer acquisition was strong in with of the transactions coming from new 
table of contents customers 
entrust identityguard surpassed million in life to date revenue and over million licensed users worldwide 
we ended with million in cash and marketable securities and no debt 
we had two product transactions over million in  compared to such transactions in revenue from transactions under thousand increased from  continuing to drive our strategy to be less reliant on large deals 
transactions under thousand accounted for of product revenue in we launched a custom selection of solutions to help enhance security for microsoft exchange server environments 
we offer three components of our layered security approach to enhance security for this powerful communication tool entrust unified communications certificates ucc  entrust entelligence messaging server and the entrust identityguard versatile authentication platform 
we launched the latest version of the versatile authentication platform entrust identityguard the release added new authentication options like ip geolocation and included integration with the entrust open fraud intelligence network ofin 
our public key infrastructure pki enabled digital signatures continued to secure us epassports 
the us state department reached the million milestone in december for total epassport deployment 
the digital signatures on epassports illustrated how pki technology is being used in a number of new applications  reinforcing pki as the gold standard for digital security 
we announced that we were chosen to provide pki and secure e mail to the saudi arabian government 
the kingdom sought a trusted vendor for their national id project and to provide security for their e government rollout  which would protect some million citizens 
sc magazine named entrust as a finalist for the excellence award best security company category 
it security vendors nominated their solutions for consideration in sc magazine s awards program  and entries were judged by a panel of leading chief security officers from major corporations and large public sector organizations 
the annual sc magazine awards have recognized key contributors and outstanding products in the security space for more than a decade 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  the provision for income taxes  accounting for uncertain tax positions  valuation of goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long term assets  and stock based compensation 
these areas are expected to continue to be ongoing elements of our critical accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
we analyze various factors  including 
table of contents a review of the specifics of each transaction  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenues and cost recognized 
different judgments and or different contract structures could lead to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on our reported earnings 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized when we have received an executed license agreement or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  the software has been shipped if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  the fees are fixed and determinable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
license revenues are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we are notified of a sale by a reseller to the end user customer in the same period that the product is delivered through to the end user customer 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 
we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
transactions with our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable at the outset  we recognize revenue when the fee becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess if collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we are sometimes subject to fiscal funding clauses in our software licensing transactions with the united states government and its agencies 
such clauses generally provide that the license is cancelable if the legislature or funding authority does not appropriate the funds necessary for the governmental unit to fulfill its obligations under the licensing arrangement 
in these circumstances  software licensing arrangements with governmental organizations containing a fiscal funding clause are evaluated to determine whether the uncertainty of a possible license arrangement cancellation is remote 
if the likelihood of cancellation is assessed as remote  then the software licensing arrangement is considered non cancelable and the related software licensing revenue is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include two or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
for arrangements where vendor specific objective evidence is not available for a delivered element  we first allocate the arrangement fee to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference residual between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is 
table of contents recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon substantially similar sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts to other customers 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon substantially similar sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would undertake to allocate the corresponding revenues amongst the various components  as described above 
we also eliminate intercompany profits on revenue transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries that are accounted for under the equity method to the extent of our ownership interest in that related party  if the product and or services have not been sold through to an unrelated third party end user customer 
our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
when the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and consulting services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized based upon the percentage of work effort completed on the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain doubtful accounts allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of not collecting a specific account receivable becomes probable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best information available to us and is re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we exhaust all avenues and methods of collection  including the use of third party collection agencies  before writing off a customer balance as uncollectible 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
each circumstance in which we conclude that a provision for non payment by a customer may be required must be carefully considered in order to determine the true factors leading to that potential non payment to ensure that it is proper for it to be categorized as an allowance for bad debts 
however  a significant change in the financial condition of a major customer  such as the european distributor discussed below  could have a material impact on our estimates regarding the sufficiency of our allowance 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of gross accounts receivable at december   compared to of gross accounts receivable at december  no customer accounted for or more of net accounts receivable at december  for more information on our customer concentration  see our related discussion in risk factors 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  and the timing of information related to the change in financial condition could result in a different assessment of the existing credit risk of our accounts receivable and thus  a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported earnings 

table of contents during  we became aware of financial concerns regarding one of our european distributors and  as a result  we concluded that it was necessary to record an increase to our provision for doubtful accounts of million  which accounted for the majority of the million increase in this provision for that year 
these balances remain outstanding and  as a result  the allowance for doubtful accounts remains substantially unchanged from the end of for these items  other than to adjust for the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  the allowance for doubtful accounts has increased by approximately thousand in to provide for miscellaneous accounts that have continued to age from the end of and the earlier quarters of provision for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to assess our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states 
in addition  we have based the calculation of our income taxes in each jurisdiction upon inter company agreements  which could be challenged by tax authorities in these jurisdictions 
the income tax accounting process involves our determining our actual current exposure in each jurisdiction together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue and accrued restructuring charges  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   which offsets deferred income tax assets relating to united states and foreign net operating loss nol and tax credit carry forwards in the amount of million and million of deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
this valuation allowance represents the full value of our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets as a result of our recent history of financial losses 
therefore  our balance sheet includes no net deferred tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the timing of the temporary differences becoming deductible 
we consider  among other available information  historical earnings  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other matters in making this assessment 
until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance and will not record any benefit from the deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of not being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin no 
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the provisions of fin no 
were effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we were not required to record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits  resulting in no adjustment to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
correspondingly  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at january  was zero and  thus  did not impact our effective tax rate 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits did not change as of december  
table of contents the implementation of fin no 
required us to use judgment in establishing the tax positions undertaken by us in our tax filings across the world  as well as determining which of these positions are certain or uncertain 
in making these determinations  we were required to make interpretations of tax legislation and administrative enforcement of this legislation in multiple jurisdictions  but primarily in the united states and canada 
in addition  we used judgment to assess whether the identified uncertain tax positions were more likely than not of being sustained upon audit examination by the tax authority in the relevant jurisdictions 
if applicable  we are also required to make estimates of the value of unrecognized tax benefits and the significance of any change to our results of operations and financial position 
finally  we were required to estimate  if applicable  the financial impact of interest and penalties of any position that would not likely be sustained on audit 
valuation of goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long term assets we have completed several acquisitions in recent years  from which we have acquired goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  in the form of purchased product rights  customer relationships  partner relationships and non competition agreement assets 
we purchased cygnacom security solutions  inc and encommerce  inc 
in  entrust japan co 
limited and certain assets of amikanow corporation in  and orion security solutions  inc and business signatures corporation in these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase prices were allocated to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired  we are required to make significant assumptions and judgments regarding such things as the estimated future cash flows that we believe will be generated as a result of the acquisition of customer partner relationships and purchased product rights  and the estimated useful life of these acquired intangible assets 
we believe that our assumptions and resulting conclusions are the most appropriate based on existing information and market expectations 
however  different assumptions and judgments as to future events could have resulted in different fair values being allocated to the intangible assets acquired 
we will review these assets for impairment in future  in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which require goodwill to be reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill with a balance of million at december  is tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
to determine any goodwill impairment  we perform a two step process on an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary  to determine whether the fair value of the relevant business unit exceeds carrying value and the amount of impairment loss  if any 
this test requires us to make judgments as to what is the appropriate business unit with which to associate the individual components of goodwill for the purposes of determining whether the carrying value of the goodwill has exceeded the fair value or market value of the relevant business unit 
in our judgment  we operate in only one business segment 
the assumptions used to test for impairment  including expected revenues  discount rates  and terminal values  are highly subjective 
valuation models are sensitive to changes in assumptions  and therefore changes in these assumptions in the future could result in significant impairment charges or changes to our expected amortization 
no impairment was required as a result of the annual impairment test as of december  purchased product rights  customer relationships  partner relationships and non competition agreements of key personnel of acquired companies totaling million at december  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  generally four to ten years 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in such reviews  the related expected undiscounted cash flows are compared with their carrying values to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
these reviews required significant judgment and estimation regarding the amount and timing of future revenues and related expenses associated with these acquired assets 

table of contents in addition  we have a net balance of million from our investment in other long term assets at december   which consist primarily of capitalized software development costs  which includes costs to develop video based training  for both general security and entrust specific solutions  for sale to our customers 
these capitalized costs are amortized ratably as the underlying revenues are recognized on sales of capitalized software or over a three year period 
the economic useful life of these capitalized software development costs is periodically re assessed 
we are not aware of any impairment events during the year ended december  however  if the demand for the technologies  products and assets acquired and developed materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment in these assets  which would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock award program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to our success by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing shareholders 
stock based awards may be granted to employees when they first join us  when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
stock based awards may also be granted in specific circumstances for retention or reward purposes 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional awards to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock based award plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant and become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years 
options issued before april  generally expire ten years from the date of grant  awards issued on or after april  generally expire seven years from the date of grant 
in addition  we use restricted stock units rsus and stock appreciation rights sars in incentive compensation plans for employees and members of the board of directors  in place of  or in combination with stock options to purchase shares of our stock 
rsus allow the employees to receive our common stock once the units vest 
the rsus generally vest over two to four years 
beginning in  the compensation committee of the board of directors has issued performance stock units to certain key employees 
these performance grants are based on the achievement of certain pre determined criteria such as budgeted level of revenue attainment or target stock price 
the associated compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is accrued over the service period when that the performance criteria are reasonably certain to be achieved 
compensation cost for an award with a market condition will be recognized ratably for each vesting tranche over the requisite service period in a similar manner as an award with a service condition 
we recognize that stock options and other stock based incentive awards dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
accordingly  from to we reduced our gross stock option grant rate  which contributed to a low net grant rate under our stock based incentive plans during that time 
in the gross grant rate increased for a number of reasons including issuing employee equity pursuant to two acquisitions and hiring a key executive 
the equity plan overhang also increased as a result of assuming the equity plan of one acquired company 
in we returned to our practice from to of reducing our gross stock option grant rate and keeping a low net grant rate 
the compensation committee of the board of directors oversees the granting of all stock based incentive awards 
sfas no 
r requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that 
table of contents will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating awards expected to vest including type of awards  employee class  and our historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of our stock options 
those assumptions include estimating the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock over the expected term  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate expected during the option term and the expected dividends to be paid 
we have reviewed each of these assumptions and determined our best estimate for these variables 
of these assumptions  the expected volatility of our common stock is the most difficult to estimate since it is based on expected performance of our common stock 
we use the implied volatility of historical market prices for our common stock on the public stock market to estimate expected volatility 
an increase in the expected volatility  expected term  and risk free interest rate  all will cause an increase in compensation expense 
the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
in  compensation expense of million was recognized for stock options  rsus and sars 
total remaining compensation estimated to be recognized over the remaining service periods for these awards is million 
this compensation cost included estimation of expected forfeitures 
forfeiture estimations are based on analysis of historical forfeiture rates 
accordingly  stock based compensation will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations depending on levels of stock based awards granted in the future 
in general  the annual stock based compensation expense is expected to decline in future years when compared to the expense reported in prior years  since we plan to reduce our gross stock based award grants 
this decline is primarily the result of a change in stock based compensation strategy as determined by management

extended government revenues in the united states were million for  representing a increase from million in the level of non north american revenues has fluctuated from period to period and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the decrease in total revenues during compared to was driven primarily by decreased average deal size for product transactions  primarily outside of north america  and a shift in our product mix toward our emerging growth products  which includes identityguard  boundary messaging and fraud detection 
while the higher volume of emerging growth product transactions worked to improve our product revenues in  our overall revenues were impacted as these deals tend to carry less professional services requirements

table of contents the increase in product revenues for  when compared to  is due to growth in our pki product category 
in particular  our pki revenue  which represented of product revenues in  increased over last year 
the key drivers of pki growth have been the growth of our ssl certificate business which was up from  while our core pki product revenue is up over last year 
global government projects around epassports  national ids and government employee credentialing for projects like hspd helped drive the core pki growth 
also  growth in ssl came from continued market share growth in the enterprise space  as well as the launch of two new certificate types  ev ssl certificates and unified communications certificates ucc ssl certificates for microsoft web outlook 
in general  pki is experiencing a resurgence of interest in digital certificates for authentication and the growing need to encrypt information both at rest and in transit  with strong authentication of secure messaging continuing to be the key revenue drivers 
we experienced improved interest in our government solutions in  with million of product revenues from extended government organizations during  compared to million for  an increase of

our emerging growth identityguard  boundary messaging and fraud detection products continued to perform well in  representing of product revenues  although revenues from this product category declined compared to  mainly due to the spike in revenues we experienced in second half of as us financial institutions focused on ffiec compliance 
this factor was the primary driver of the growth of products revenues in when compared to identityguard continued to be the largest component of our emerging growth products revenues  with the number of transactions increasing to in  representing a increase over we had product revenue transactions a product revenue transaction is defined as an identityguard product sale of any size plus all other product sales in excess of thousand in  up from in  or a increase  which in turn was up from product revenue transactions in  or an increase of 
this included new customers in  which represented a and increase from and  respectively 
however  the average product revenue transaction size decreased from thousand in to thousand in  or a decrease of  after the average product revenue transaction size decreased from thousand in this downward trend in transaction size is due to a shift in our product mix toward our lower cost emerging growth products 
however  growth in deals under thousand is fueling our overall top line product revenue growth in and compared to the respective prior years 
revenue from deals under thousand increased over and accounted for of product revenues in  which we believe speaks well of the underlying strength of our portfolio and the balance we are starting to see in product revenue performance 
we would expect transaction levels to remain high going forward and the trend of lower average deal size to continue in the coming quarters 
in general  the top five average quarterly product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues declined from and in and  respectively to in this decrease in average product revenue transaction size and the decline in the top five average product revenue transactions are consistent with our expectations 
the combination of customer buying patterns  generally smaller sized identityguard transactions and increased subscription business gives us a more predictable revenue base 
also  consistent with this trend of lower average product revenue size were the number of deals greater than million  which were down to two in from three in and five in we would expect transaction levels to remain high going forward and the trend of lower average deal size to continue in the coming periods

the decrease in services and maintenance revenues for compared to was due to a shift in demand to our emerging growth products  which require less professional services to implement  deploy and integrate  than our pki and single sign on solutions

the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars for when compared to  can be attributed primarily to the reduced facilities related costs due to lower depreciation on our ottawa facility  reduced third party hardware expenses and reduced other outside service costs

this plan may have an adverse impact on the gross profit for services and maintenance  as the gross profit realized by using partners and sub contractors is generally lower 
the mix and volume of services and maintenance revenues may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction  which will also affect our gross margins and results of operations

sales and marketing headcount increased on average year over year when compared to the previous year  resulting in increased salaries and benefits expense  including sales commissions  and increased facilities costs 
offsetting these increases were reductions in bad debt expense and marketing programs spending for in addition  we have experienced an unfavorable shift in the exchange rates between the us dollar and other major currencies  which resulted in higher reported sales and marketing expenses of million in when compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for  compared to  was the net result of higher overall expenses  resulting in a one percentage point increase for  offset by a two percentage point decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues due to higher total revenues when compared to the sales and marketing expense increase for when compared to was primarily due to higher staff related costs  purchased intangibles amortization associated with the business signatures acquisition and increased spending on marketing programs due to higher advertising expenses  focused on generating awareness of our brand and ffiec solutions

we will continue to focus on our channels  with a view to providing the executive team time to focus on strategically growing the business 
however  we believe it is necessary for us to continue to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs by maintaining our strategy of a investing in hiring and training our sales force in anticipation of future market growth  and b investing in marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
we believe it is necessary to invest in marketing programs that will improve the awareness and understanding of information security governance  and we will continue to invest in marketing toward that goal

restructuring charges and adjustments during  we made adjustments to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan with respect to our santa clara  california facility 
the previous sublease with our subtenant was scheduled to end in december although we had been monitoring the sublet market on an on going basis  we had received an extension offer and had begun preparations for placing the facility on the market 
these events caused us to revisit our estimated sublease recoveries at that time 
we concluded that we needed to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to our june restructuring plan by a further million in the first quarter of fiscal to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries as evidenced by the market for leased facilities in that region 
subsequently  in the second quarter of  we made a further adjustment to decrease the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan with respect to our santa clara  california facility by thousand  to reflect the fact that the building sublease was extended with the current subtenant to march  and the corresponding expected sublet lease recoveries 
these adjustments were charged to the restructuring charges line in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in write down of long term strategic and equity investments we recorded non cash charges in the first quarter of related to the impairment of long term investments in asia digital media and ohana of million and thousand  respectively  as we concluded that these investments had suffered an other than temporary decline in fair value

we began accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of  since we had the potential to significantly influence its operations and management 

table of contents provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of thousand in  compared to thousand in and thousand in these provisions represent primarily the taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the impairment of long term strategic investments  stock option expenses  purchased product rights  restructuring charges  foreign research and development tax credits  as well as an adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset the tax benefits from the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available 
quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
these data have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
as a result of the adjustment to our restructuring accrual related to our california facility and the impairment of our investment in asia digital media and ohana recorded in the first quarter of  our operating expenses and net loss were higher in that quarter than in the subsequent quarters of and the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we used million of cash in operating activities during this cash outflow was primarily a result of an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in accrued restructuring charges of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other receivables of million  partially offset by cash inflows resulting from a net income after adjusting for non cash charges of million  and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents a slight worsening from the days that we reported at december  the overall increase in days sales outstanding from december  was mainly due to lower in quarter collections due to poorer sales linearity compared to the fourth quarter of  partly offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from the previous year 
for purposes of calculating average days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the applicable quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end is affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and the length of customer s payment cycle 
generally  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers  so that an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our days sales outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
we have observed an increase in the length of our customers payment cycles  which may result in higher accounts receivable balances  and could expose us to greater general credit risks with our customers and increased bad debt expense 
during  we generated million of our cash related to investing activities 
cash provided by reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million  proceeds from disposition of property and equipment of million and proceeds from the sale of strategic long term investments of million was partially offset by the investment of million in property and equipment  primarily for computer hardware upgrades throughout our organization  and million in other long term assets related to capitalized software development costs 
we generated cash of million in financing activities during as a result of cash provided by the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments during although we continue to target operating profitability  based on sustainable revenue and operating expense structures  we estimate that we may continue to use cash in fiscal to satisfy the obligations provided for under our restructuring program 
however  if operating losses continue to occur  then cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be negatively affected 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in future periods  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
in terms of long term liquidity requirements  we will need to fund the million of accrued restructuring charges at december  through fiscal  as detailed below 
this amount is net of expected sublet recoveries on restructured facilities of million 
the lease obligations included in these accrued restructuring

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk associated with interest rates our investment policy states that we will invest our cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  in investments that are designed to preserve principal  maintain liquidity and maximize return 
we actively manage our investments in accordance with these objectives 
some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  that we held at december  and that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of those dates december  december  maturity maturity within months months months months within months months months months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents investments classified as short term marketable investments total amortized cost fair value we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of these instruments were determined by net present values 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be less than thousand 
risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  the european union and japan 
this exposure is not considered to be material with respect to the united kingdom  european and japanese operations due to the fact that these operations are not significant 
however  because a disproportionate amount of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  through our canadian operations  while our canadian denominated revenue streams are cyclical  we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar  and in particular  fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar 
therefore  a favorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in higher revenues when translated into us dollars  but would also mean expenses would be higher in a corresponding fashion and to a greater degree 
historically  we have not engaged in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this foreign exchange risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses is minimized 
however  as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  our reported expense base increased by million in  when compared to  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states 
table of contents and canadian dollars 
taking into account the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on reported canadian revenues  the net effect on reported earnings was million for  when compared to in the past  when perceived by management to be advantageous  we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  to cover exposures on canadian subsidiary s expenses that are denominated in canadian dollars  in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility that might result from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  covering exposures on approximately million of our canadian subsidiary s expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
none of these contracts extended past december  and no previously purchased foreign exchange contracts had extended past september  subsequent to year end  we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars covering exposures on approximately million of expenses denominated in canadian dollars in the first quarter of we currently have not engaged in any forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars to cover exposures on expenses denominated in canadian dollars in future periods beyond the first quarter of risk associated with long term strategic investments we hold an investment in ohana  with a net carrying value at december  of thousand  representing approximately of the issued common shares of ohana 
during  we were informed of an ohana re financing  which coupled with the changes in the business outlook  led us to conclude that the expectations for ohana had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership 
as a result  we recorded in an impairment of our investment in ohana of thousand 
this investment is now accounted for under the cost method 
ohana is in the start up or development stage  and may lack the financial resources  licenses  technology and governmental approvals necessary to import  develop or offer for sale any commercial product or service 
if the demand for ohana s products and services materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our remaining investment
