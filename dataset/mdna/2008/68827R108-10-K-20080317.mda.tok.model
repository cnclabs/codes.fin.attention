when we use the terms osiris  we  us  and our we mean osiris therapeutics  inc  a delaware corporation 
company overview we are a leading stem cell therapeutic company headquartered in columbia  maryland and focused on developing and marketing products to treat medical conditions in the inflammatory  orthopedic  and cardiovascular areas 
we were incorporated in delaware in april our predecessor company was organized in we currently manufacture  market and sell osteocel for regenerating bone in orthopedic indications 
it is the only commercially available product in the us containing viable stem cells 
our lead biologic drug candidate  prochymal  is being evaluated in phase iii clinical trials for three indications  including acute and steroid refractory graft versus host disease gvhd and crohn s disease  and is the only stem cell therapeutic currently granted both orphan drug and fast track status by the food and drug administration fda 
prochymal is also being developed for the repair of heart tissue following a heart attack and for protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes 
our pipeline of internally developed biologic drug candidates under evaluation also includes chondrogen for osteoarthritis in the knee 
we have also partnered with genzyme corporation to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
osiris is a fully integrated company  having developed capabilities in research  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of stem cell products 
we have developed an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our technology in the united states and a number of foreign countries including us and foreign patents owned or licensed 
osteocel and our two biologic drug candidates utilize human mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs 
mscs can selectively differentiate  based on the tissue environment  into various tissue lineages  such as muscle  bone  cartilage  marrow stroma  tendon or fat 
in addition  mscs have anti inflammatory properties and can prevent fibrosis or scarring 
these characteristics give mscs the potential to treat a wide variety of medical conditions 
we believe that our biologic drug candidates have advantages over other stem cell therapeutics in development for the following reasons stem cell source 
our stem cells are obtained from adult bone marrow  a readily available source 
the cells are drawn from the hips of volunteer donors between the ages of and years  using a simple needle and syringe aspiration 
because the cells are obtained from consenting adult donors  we are able to largely avoid the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic and fetal stem cell research 
ability to mass produce 
through our proprietary manufacturing methods  we can grow mscs in a controlled fashion to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
our ability to produce a large quantity of treatments from one donation provides us with manufacturing efficiencies and product consistency that are essential to commercialization 
universal compatibility 
many stem cell therapies under development can elicit a rejection response in the recipient and therefore require donor to recipient matching or potentially harmful immunosuppression 
this greatly reduces manufacturing efficiencies and creates a risk of mismatch which can result in an acute inflammatory response and  potentially  in death 
based on our clinical experience  we believe that our biologic drug candidates are not rejected by the patient s immune system and so  like type o negative blood  do not require matching 
this universal compatibility allows us to produce a standardized product available to all patients in almost any medical setting 
treatment on demand 
our biologic drug candidates can be stored frozen at end user medical facilities until they are needed 
we anticipate that medical facilities will be able to prescribe and dispense these products in much the same way as conventional drugs 
in contrast  other stem cell technologies under development require weeks to prepare after a patient s need is identified 
this is a key feature of our technology  as many patients in the critical care setting require prompt treatment 
the following table summarizes key information about osteocel and our biologic drug candidates 
product candidate indication status osteocel spinal procedures marketing orthopedics marketing prochymal steroid refractory acute gvhd phase iii first line treatment of acute gvhd phase iii biologics refractory crohn s disease phase iii type i diabetes phase ii acute myocardial infarction phase ii acute radiation syndrome preclinical chondrogen osteoarthritis cartilage protection phase i ii osteocel consists of a matrix of cancellous bone containing mesenchymal stem cells and is used in spinal fusion and other orthopedic surgical procedures 
cancellous bone is the porous and spongy inner structure accounting for approximately of total bone mass 
osteocel is the only commercially available product containing viable stem cells in the united states 
we launched osteocel in july and to date it has been used in over  surgical procedures 
we produce osteocel from the marrow rich bone of organ and tissue donors  and we believe that it is properly characterized  and regulated by the fda  as a human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based product  or hct p  under section of the public health service act 
unlike our biologic drug candidates  our ability to supply osteocel is limited by the amount of marrow rich bone that we are able to obtain from organ and tissue donors 
osteocel is currently distributed non exclusively by us and by blackstone medical a subsidiary of orthofix international nv for orthopedic indications  and jointly by us and blackstone medical for spinal procedures 
we are party to a multi year agreement with allosource  a non profit tissue procurement organization for the supply by allosource to us of tissue for use in the manufacture of osteocel 
under the terms of the agreement  allosource has committed to provide bone matrix to us for use in the production of osteocel  and to ensure that the technology is made available to the communities from which it is sourced  the agreement also enables allosource to act as a non exclusive distributor of osteocel in allosource s local donor communities 
recently  we entered into a multi year agreement with tissue banks international tbi  a non profit tissue procurement organization for the supply by tbi to us of tissue for use in the manufacture of osteocel 
under the terms of the agreement  tbi has committed to provide bone matrix to us for use in the production of osteocel  and to ensure that the technology is made available to the communities from which it is sourced  the agreement enables tbi also to act as a non exclusive distributor of osteocel in tbi s local donor communities 
prochymal is our lead biologic drug candidate and is being evaluated in phase iii clinical trials for three indications  including the first line treatment of acute gvhd  steroid refractory acute gvhd and biologics refractory crohn s disease and is the only stem cell therapeutic currently designated by the fda as both an orphan drug and fast track product 
phase iii clinical trial steroid refractory acute gvhd we are currently enrolling patients in a pivotal phase iii trial for the treatment of steroid refractory acute gvhd 
gvhd is a life threatening immune system reaction that commonly affects the skin  gastrointestinal tract  and liver in patients who have received a bone marrow transplant 
although in the us there are no drugs approved for treating gvhd  the disease is commonly treated off label with steroids 
gvhd that does not respond to this treatment is known as steroid refractory gvhd 
a large majority of steroid refractory gvhd patients die within six months 
in our phase ii trial for treatment refractory gvhd  we enrolled patients that did not respond to treatment with steroids and at least one second line therapy 
of these patients  responded to prochymal 
our phase iii trial to evaluate prochymal as a treatment for steroid refractory gvhd is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study designed to enroll up to patients 
the trial is investigating patient response to eight infusions of prochymal administered twice per week for four consecutive weeks 
the primary trial endpoint is complete resolution of gvhd for at least day duration 
each patient will also be monitored for safety for up to days after their first treatment with prochymal 
six month survival is a key secondary endpoint 
this trial is being conducted in approximately centers in the united states  canada  europe and australia 
phase iii clinical trial first line treatment of acute gvhd 
we are also enrolling patients in a phase iii trial evaluating prochymal as an add on therapy to steroids for the first line treatment of acute gvhd 
our phase ii trial for treatment of newly diagnosed acute gvhd  found that patients were twice as likely to have total clinical resolution of their disease when prochymal was added to steroid therapy  compared to reported results for steroid only treatment 
twenty nine of patients  or responded after receiving two infusions of prochymal  with patients  or achieving a complete response  meaning the patients had experienced total clinical resolution of the disease 
at six months  of all patients treated with prochymal still had a durable response requiring no additional immunosuppressive therapy  clinical intervention  or increased steroid use 
furthermore  of patients achieving a durable response were alive at six months 
our phase iii trial to evaluate prochymal as a first line treatment for gvhd is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study designed to enroll up to patients 
the trial is investigating patient response to a total of six infusions during the first four weeks of the study 
the primary trial endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response at day and who survive to day without the addition of a second line therapy 
the study is being conducted at approximately centers in the united states and canada 
phase iii clinical trial biologics refractory crohn s disease 
based on our clinical observations of the effects of prochymal on the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with gvhd  we are developing prochymal for the treatment of crohn s disease 
crohn s disease is a chronic condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract 
we have completed patient enrollment in a phase ii trial for crohn s disease under a separate investigational new drug application ind 
we received fast track designation from the fda  for the development of prochymal for moderate to severe crohn s disease patients that are refractory to standard therapies  including biologics 
we are currently enrolling patients in a phase iii trial evaluating prochymal for the treatment of moderate to severe crohn s disease that is refractory to biological therapy 
the study is designed to enroll up to patients and is double blind  placebo controlled  and includes patients  to years of age  with a crohn s disease activity index cdai greater than the primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients with cdai of less than clinical remission at day the study is being conducted at leading centers in the united states and canada 
phase ii clinical trial acute myocardial infarction 
prochymal is also being evaluated for the repair of heart muscle in patients who have suffered a heart attack 
based on statistics published in by the american stroke association and the american heart association  approximately  individuals in the united states each year experience their first heart attack 
according to these same statistics  approximately of these patients suffer extensive damage to their heart muscle leading to heart failure within six years 
in preclinical studies in animal models  prochymal targeted the damaged area of the heart following a single intravenous infusion 
these studies also indicate that prochymal prevents scar formation that typically occurs after a heart attack and improves cardiac function eight to ten weeks after its administration 
we completed enrollment in a phase i clinical trial for prochymal to evaluate its safety and efficacy to restore heart function in patients experiencing a first time myocardial infarction mi 
in march  we reported six month results in this trial 
in a patient  double blind  placebo controlled study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of the intravenous administration of prochymal  mi patients receiving the therapy had significantly lower rates of adverse events  such as cardiac arrhythmias  as well as significant improvements in heart  lung and global function 
administration of prochymal was found to be well tolerated at all dose levels 
based on these positive findings  we have received approval from the fda to initiate a phase ii trial 
phase ii clinical trial type early onset diabetes 
we have recently initiated a phase ii  patient  placebo controlled study in the united states for the treatment of early onset type diabetes in individuals to years old 
we believe that based upon their mechanism of action  mscs may home to the pancreas and inhibit the local immune and inflammatory responses  preventing the destruction of pancreatic islets and promoting the repair of pancreatic tissue damage 
patients must be enrolled within to weeks of being diagnosed with type diabetes and will receive three infusions of prochymal over the course of days 
primary efficacy will be measured at six months and the primary endpoint is the marker of insulin response in response to glucose stimulation 
we have entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf for this study 
this agreement provides for jdrf to fund million of clinical study costs during and preclinical study acute radiation syndrome 
in  we partnered with genzyme corporation to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in january  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod for the development and stockpiling of prochymal for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome ars 
under the terms of the contract  dod will provide funding to us in two stages  with an initial amount of million expected to be earned in the fully funded value of the contract  assuming fda approval of prochymal for ars and exercise by dod of all of its purchase options for up to  doses of prochmal at current prices  per dose is up to million 
we will carry out this contract in collaboration with genzyme 
chondrogen is our biologic drug candidate for the treatment of osteoarthritis and the reduction of pain in the knee 
according to a article in the american journal of sports medicine  approximately million people have surgery to remove damaged or torn meniscus in the united states each year 
as noted in a article in the journal sports medicine  patients who have had this procedure are to times more likely to develop osteoarthritis  a highly debilitating orthopedic condition 
there are currently no fda approved products available to regenerate meniscal tissue 
in several preclinical studies  chondrogen regenerated meniscal tissue and prevented osteoarthritis in animal models 
we recently completed enrollment in a phase i ii clinical trial for chondrogen to evaluate its safety and efficacy in patients following surgery to remove torn meniscus 
a total of patients were treated in the phase i ii  double blind study evaluating the safety and exploratory effectiveness of chondrogen  a preparation of adult stem cells formulated for direct injection into the knee 
at the twelve month time point  chondrogen met its primary endpoint  demonstrating product safety 
the data also showed improvements in joint condition that correlated with a clinically and statistically significant improvement in pain in patients with osteoarthritis oa who received chondrogen as compared to those treated with the control  hyaluronic acid ha 
patients will be followed for safety and additional preliminary efficacy  such as cartilage damage and changes in the meniscus for two years under the current study protocol 
we expended approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  on research and development 
our research and development expenditures in and were entirely sponsored by us 
in  we were reimbursed for million of research and development expenditures through grants with the us government 
for more detailed financial information  including information regarding our revenues  profit and loss  and total assets and research and development costs and expenses for the past three fiscal years  see our financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k for fiscal year scientific background stem cells are a special class of cells that can self replicate and differentiate into multiple tissue types 
different populations of stem cells  also called progenitor or precursor cells  reside within the body 
these cells are generally classified according to their differentiation potential  or ability to become distinct cell types 
embryonic stem cells are recognized as being totipotent  or unlimited  in terms of the number of different cell types they can become 
other stem cells are either multipotent  meaning capable of becoming two or more cell types  or unipotent  meaning preprogrammed for a single final cell type 
multipotent stem cells include the hematopoietic stem cells responsible for generating cells associated with the circulatory and immune systems  mesenchymal stem cells responsible for the formation of connective tissue cells  and neuronal stem cells dedicated to producing the different nervous system cell types 
stem cells participate in embryological and fetal development and orchestrate tissue repair following disease or injury in the adult 
though the precise mechanism of their activity has not yet been determined  experimental work has provided empirical evidence of the therapeutic benefit of various types of stem cells administered to animal and human subjects 
the embryonic stem cell  or esc  has the greatest differentiation potential and is capable of developing into all cell types found within the human body 
escs must be harvested from human embryos  giving rise to ethical controversies surrounding the procurement of escs  which have hindered progress in esc research 
the united states government has significantly restricted the funding of esc research 
also  technical difficulties in purifying and growing escs have prevented widespread experimental work capable of withstanding academic or regulatory scrutiny 
in the adult  two major classes of stem cells exist in bone marrow  hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells 
throughout life  hematopoietic stem cells  or hscs  located within the bone marrow give rise to most types of blood cells 
hsc transplantation has served as the basis for a number of aggressive treatments for various types of cancer 
however  therapies based on hscs are largely limited to hematological disorders because hscs can only differentiate into blood cells 
in contrast to hscs  mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  are progenitor cells that differentiate into various connective tissues  such as bone  muscle  fat  tendon  ligament  cartilage and bone marrow stroma when they receive appropriate biochemical and biomechanical signals 
other biochemical stimuli cause mscs to mobilize to areas of injury or inflammatory disease 
once there  mscs coordinate tissue regeneration at a local level by producing tissue growth factors and by interacting with local cells to reduce inflammation and scarring 
importantly  mscs do not express markers on the surface of cells  known as hla class ii antigens  which are responsible for recognition of the cells by the immune system 
also  the cell surface markers  cd  cd and cd  which are essential for activation of immune cells  are not present on mscs 
these characteristics allow mscs to be transplanted into an unrelated patient without giving rise to an immune response  regenerate connective tissues like bone and cartilage  act as a potent anti inflammatory agent  and exhibit anti fibrotic activity to limit tissue damage 
mscs and hscs are most readily isolated from bone marrow 
because mscs represent a small fraction of bone marrow cells  they require amplification to be clinically useful 
we have developed and optimized a proprietary process for isolating and expanding these cells using standardized cell culture methodologies 
we can grow mscs in a controlled fashion to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
stem cells can be derived from either the patient  referred to as an autologous source  or from a donor  referred to as an allogeneic source 
for many cell therapies  allogeneic sourcing is not possible due to the immune response that typically occurs following the injection of unrelated cells 
the non immunogenic nature of mscs permits allogeneic cell sourcing and carries significant advantages over autologous sourcing 
allogeneic cell sourcing from a healthy donor population allows for specific quality control measures to select therapeutically optimal stem cells 
for example  if a patient s cells are of poor quality due to advanced age  disease or metabolic state  the product to be re infused will likely be of similar poor quality 
we believe that allogeneic sources used in large scale production will enable us to utilize quality control practices to ensure that product potency is reproducible from treatment to treatment 
we have developed and continue to develop quality standards for our biologic drug candidates  including potency assays directed to the specific indications for use 
to our knowledge  no patients participating in our clinical trials or who have used osteocel to date have experienced an immunogenic response 
strategy we are striving to be the first company to receive fda marketing approval and to commercialize a stem cell drug therapy and become the world s leading provider of stem cell therapies 
successfully commercialize our lead stem cell therapy  prochymal 
we are currently enrolling patients in three phase iii clinical trials for prochymal 
assuming marketing approval  we plan to develop a sales and marketing force to promote prochymal initially for the first line treatment of acute gvhd and steroid refractory acute gvhd  followed by moderate to severe crohn s disease 
based on the small number of bone marrow transplantation hospitals in the united states and the lack of effective treatments for this population  we believe we can successfully market prochymal with a specialized sales force for the treatment of gvhd 
expand our pipeline of biologic drug candidates where our stem cell technology has a therapeutic potential 
we are continuously investing in our biologic drug candidate pipeline by evaluating our therapies in additional diseases and disorders where we believe mscs have potential therapeutic benefit 
this will allow us to maintain our position as the leader in cellular therapeutics 
exploit our msc technology  manufacturing ability and proprietary know how to advance our pipeline 
we intend to leverage our preclinical research  safety data and manufacturing ability to rapidly and efficiently grow our biologic drug candidate pipeline 
because we utilize mscs as the active agent for all of our biologic drug candidates  we believe the accumulated safety data will reduce the time and cost associated with early stage clinical trials for new indications 
internally develop and commercialize future biologic drug candidates 
we believe that we have the requisite experience to develop and commercialize our unpartnered biologic drug candidates and any future biologic drug candidates without the help of a strategic partner 
due to our experience with osteocel and our current pipeline candidates  we believe we have gained the clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and commercial capabilities to successfully develop and commercialize biologic drug candidates 
marketed product osteocel osteocel consists of a matrix of cancellous bone containing mesenchymal stem cells and is used in spinal fusion and other orthopedic surgical procedures 
it is the only commercially available product in the united states containing viable stem cells 
we launched osteocel in july and to date it has been used in over  surgical procedures 
osteocel is currently distributed non exclusively by us  blackstone medical  allosource and tbi for orthopedic indications  and by us jointly with blackstone medical for spinal procedures 
according to data published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  over  surgeries are performed in the united states each year that require the reconstruction or replacement of bone 
the standard of care is a procedure known as autograft  in which bone is harvested from another site within the same patient and transferred to the site of injury 
the harvested bone contains stem cells and is often an effective agent for regenerating bone 
however  this procedure has significant disadvantages 
an additional surgery is required to obtain the autograft bone  resulting in increased time under anesthesia  additional blood loss  and the costs associated with an additional surgery 
these patients also face an increased risk of infection and may experience chronic post operative pain from the harvest procedure 
as noted in an article published by the university of california  los angeles ucla department of orthopaedic surgery  complications from the autograft harvest occur in up to of patients having the procedure 
as such  we believe there is a significant medical need for a product that can promote bone formation reliably and eliminate the need for autograft 
spinal fusion is a surgical procedure used to correct problems in the spine bones  or vertebrae  and is one of the most common and expensive surgeries in orthopedics 
based on data published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  there were  spine fusion surgeries in  associated with multi billion dollar health care costs 
all spinal fusion surgeries require autograft or other material to support bone formation 
non viable bone sourced from cadavers  synthetic materials  and recombinant growth factors are used as alternatives to autograft 
each has significant limitations and none has the same regenerative characteristics of autograft 
while osteocel contains the same bone forming properties as autograft  it has several distinct advantages osteocel avoids the potential complications and expense of an additional surgical procedure  the availability of osteocel during surgery is limited only by the in house supply  while autograft availability is limited to the amount harvested from the patient in the prior surgical procedure  every lot of osteocel is tested to ensure consistent quality  while the quality of the autograft is dependent upon the health of the patient  and ease of use  storage characteristics  and shelf life allow osteocel to be used in virtually any surgical setting where bone formation is needed 
osteocel works in three ways 
the cancellous bone matrix of osteocel is osteoconductive  meaning it encourages new bone growth by providing a scaffold to support bone formation 
osteocel is also inductive 
osteoinduction is the indirect promotion of bone formation by recruiting the patient s cells to the site through signaling mechanisms 
lastly  the stem cells contained in osteocel make it osteogenic 
osteogenesis is the ability of certain cells to form bone directly 
only two current treatments contain all three of these necessary components for new bone growth autograft and osteocel 
over the past years our scientists have published over peer reviewed journal articles demonstrating the consistent osteogenic capabilities of the mscs in osteocel 
we produce osteocel from the marrow rich bone of organ and tissue donors 
since its introduction in july  we have been unable to produce quantities of osteocel sufficient to meet surgeon demand 
during  we were constrained by our manufacturing facility and limitations on the supply of marrow rich bone obtainable from adult organ and tissue donors 
to increase our ability to supply our customers  we expanded our manufacturing capacity and increased the number of organ and tissue agencies that supply us with tissue 
we are party to a multi year agreement with allosource  a non profit tissue procurement organization  for the supply by allosource to us of tissue for use in the manufacture of osteocel 
allosource has committed to to provide bone matrix to us for use in the production of osteocel  and to ensure that the technology is made available to the communities from which it is sourced  the agreement enables allosource to act as a non exclusive distributor of osteocel in allosource s donor communities 
recently  we entered into a multi year agreement with tissue banks international tbi  a non profit tissue procurement organization for the supply by tbi to us of tissue for use in the manufacture of osteocel 
under the terms of the agreement  tbi has committed to provide bone matrix to us for use in the manufacture of osteocel  and to ensure that the technology is made available to the communities from which it is sourced  the agreement enables tbi also to act as a non exclusive distributor of osteocel in tbi s local donor communities 
we believe that osteocel is properly characterized  and regulated by the fda  as a hct p under section of the public health service act 
we are in the process of developing a second generation msc product for bone repair  osteocel xc  as a long term strategy to relieve supply constraints 
unlike osteocel  osteocel xc will utilize culture expanded mscs like our other biologic drug candidates 
based on our clinical and preclinical experience with osteocel and mscs  we are preparing to submit an investigational new drug application to fda to study osteocel xc 
revenues from sales of osteocel were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal clinical programs prochymal prochymal is our biologic drug candidate that is being used to treat medical conditions in a variety of indications 
prochymal is being evaluated in phase iii clinical trials for three indications  including first line and steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease gvhd and crohn s disease  and is the only stem cell therapeutic currently designated by the fda as both an orphan drug and fast track product 
prochymal is also being developed for the repair of heart tissue following a heart attack and for the protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes 
we are also developing prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological countermeasures 
graft versus host disease gvhd is a life threatening immune system reaction that commonly affects the skin  gastrointestinal tract  and liver in patients who have received a bone marrow transplant 
we estimate that there are approximately  instances of gvhd in the united states each year 
bone marrow transplantation is a treatment of last resort for patients with certain cancers and some genetic diseases 
this procedure can result in a particularly serious type of rejection referred to as acute gvhd 
this condition gets its name because the bone marrow transplant  or the graft  begins to attack the recipient  or the host 
as noted in an article published in the journal biology of blood and marrow transplantation in  acute gvhd is one of the most common complications of allogeneic bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  affecting approximately of transplant patients 
acute gvhd is graded for prognostic and treatment purposes on a four grade scale  with grade i considered mild  grade ii moderate  and grades iii iv considered severe and life threatening 
the onset of gvhd in patients who have received a bone marrow transplant leads to a poor prognosis because of the already weakened state of such patients 
according to a article published in biology of blood and marrow transplantation  the estimated one year survival rate for patients with acute gvhd decreases drastically with increasing disease severity  as illustrated below acute gvhd estimated one year survival grade i grade ii grade iii grade iv typically  patients are treated aggressively with steroids when their gvhd reaches grade ii 
a article published in the journal blood noted that approximately of these patients will not respond to treatment with steroids and approximately of steroid refractory gvhd patients die of the disease 
the current treatments available for acute gvhd are inadequate in several ways 
first  mortality in patients with acute gvhd is unacceptably high 
second  most treatments for acute gvhd work by suppressing or destroying the immune system 
this leads to a number of debilitating side effects  including severe and life threatening infection 
unlike steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs  which have a systemic effect  prochymal s mechanism of action is designed to specifically target areas of inflammation 
therefore  we believe the use of prochymal will result in a lower rate of life threatening infection 
we are currently enrolling patients in two phase iii pivotal trials for acute gvhd and have been granted fast track status by fda for both 
the first phase iii trial is investigating prochymal in patients with steroid refractory gvhd 
approximately sites in the united states  canada  europe and australia are participating in this trial 
the second phase iii trial is evaluating prochymal as a first line treatment for acute gvhd and is taking place in approximately leading centers in the united states and canada 
a program is also ongoing to provide prochymal in a compassionate use setting for pediatric patients with severe treatment refractory acute gvhd and no remaining treatment options 
at the end of  data was reported for a total of twelve pediatric patients between five months and fifteen years of age suffering from severe grade iii iv acute gvhd 
these patients had failed  on average  lines of therapy prior to treatment with prochymal 
patients received a median of eight infusions of prochymal range at a dose of million cells per kilogram of body weight 
all patients experienced an objective clinical response to therapy  with of patients achieving a complete resolution of their gvhd 
the day survival was also and directly correlated with response rate 
there were no infusional toxicities associated with the administration of prochymal 
this pediatric compassionate use program for prochymal is ongoing 
we completed a phase ii trial evaluating prochymal as a first line treatment in combination with steroids  for patients diagnosed with grade ii through grade iv acute gvhd 
a total of patients were treated with two infusions of prochymal  administered hours apart 
the treatment commenced within hours of gvhd diagnosis 
in this study  we were evaluating safety  dose and response to treatment by day when prochymal was added to steroid therapy  patients were twice as likely to have total clinical resolution of their disease compared to reported results for steroid only treatment 
twenty nine of patients  or responded after receiving two infusions of prochymal  with patients  or achieving a complete response  meaning the patients had experienced total clinical resolution of the disease 
at six months  of all patients treated with prochymal still had a durable response requiring no additional use 
furthermore  of patients achieving a durable response were alive at six months 
beginning in  several requests were made by physicians to use prochymal in a compassionate use setting for patients with acute severe treatment refractory gvhd and no remaining treatment options 
both pediatric and adult patients that had failed to respond to steroids and other immunosuppressive agents were treated on an emergency use basis  and clinical improvements were seen in gastrointestinal and skin gvhd 
patients were treated with prochymal every hours as needed for response  for a maximum of eight treatments 
fourteen patients were treated and had failed to respond to an average of other drug therapies prior to treatment with prochymal 
a prochymal response rate was observed in this treatment refractory population  defined as an improvement in at least one affected organ by at least one full gvhd stage without disease progression in any other organ 
because the patients in this trial had previously not responded to multiple lines of therapy and their condition was immediately life threatening  for ethical reasons the use of a placebo control was not possible 
therefore  further analysis of the statistical significance of our results was not performed 
in we completed a phase i trial to determine the safety of prochymal in patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplants 
the trial investigated patient response to three different doses of prochymal 
no safety concerns related to the use of prochymal were observed in the subjects who were evaluated 
we obtained both fast track and orphan drug designation in for the use of prochymal in gvhd patients 
the fda grants fast track designation to investigational drugs that have the potential to treat life threatening diseases with unmet medical needs 
our biologic license application will be eligible for an expedited review process by the fda as a result of this designation 
orphan drug designation offers several benefits including eligibility for grants to fund studies  up to seven years of marketing exclusivity and a waiver of the biologic license application fee of approximately  prochymal is the only stem cell therapeutic currently designated by the fda as both an orphan drug and fast track product candidate 
crohn s disease based on our clinical observations of the effects of prochymal on the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with gvhd  we are developing prochymal for the treatment of crohn s disease 
crohn s disease is a chronic  life long condition that features relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract 
severe crohn s disease can cause intractable diarrhea and abdominal pain  undesirable changes in lifestyle  hospitalization  and unwanted side effects from required medications 
approximately of crohn s disease patients require at least one surgery to remove an affected portion of their intestine at some time during their lifetime  according to a article in the journal alimentary pharmacology therapeutics 
this article further notes that there are over  cases of diagnosed crohn s disease in the united states  and at any given time approximately of these cases have a severe exacerbation or relapse that does not respond to traditional immunosuppressive treatments 
standard treatments of steroids and other immune suppressants often cause secondary health problems 
according to a article in the british journal of clinical pharmacology  with current medical therapies about of patients with severe crohn s disease will relapse within one year 
we completed a phase ii trial studying prochymal as a treatment for moderate to severe crohn s disease that is refractory to steroids and other immune suppressants 
we enrolled ten patients in this study and communicated the results during the october annual meeting of the american college of gastroenterology 
the trial was a prospective  randomized  open label trial  conducted at leading centers in the united states 
patients with moderate to severe crohn s disease  defined as having a crohn s disease activity index cdai of at least  who had previously failed treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents  were given two infusions of prochymal seven days apart 
a total of ten patients were treated and nine patients were evaluated through the day follow up 
one patient elected to exit the trial prior to completion 
patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups and received prochymal on an outpatient basis 
in addition to safety parameters  patients were evaluated for changes in cdai and improvement in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire ibdq 
prior to entering the trial  patients who had been treated with infliximab or other biological agents were required to complete a washout period of days to preclude the possibility that response was the result of a previous treatment 
entering the trial  the average cdai score at baseline was patients entering this study had suffered from crohn s disease for an average of years  and of the patients required prior surgical intervention to treat their crohn s disease 
in the study  one third of the patients had a reduction of cdai of greater than points within days of treatment 
each of these responders had failed previous treatment with infliximab remicade r 
mean ibdq scores improved significantly from baseline to day to  p 
one third of the patients reported ibdq scores of at least  indicating they had achieved clinical remission of their disease 
although not reaching statistical significance  there appeared to be correlation between dose and response 
patients receiving the high dose had a point greater reduction in cdai than those receiving low dose cdai reduction of vs 

there were no infusional toxicities  and no treatment related severe adverse events 
as a result of the encouraging data  we are enrolling patients in a phase iii trial evaluating prochymal for the treatment of moderate to severe crohn s disease that is refractory to biological therapy 
the study is designed to enroll up to patients and is double blind  placebo controlled  and includes patients  to years of age  with a crohn s disease activity index cdai greater than the primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients with cdai of less than clinical remission at day the study is being conducted at leading centers in the united states and canada 
we have received fast track designation from the fda  which makes us eligible for expedited fda review of prochymal for this indication 
acute myocardial infarction we are also evaluating prochymal for the repair of heart muscle in patients who have suffered a heart attack 
preclinical studies indicate that prochymal prevents scar formation that typically occurs after a heart attack and improves cardiac function eight to ten weeks after its administration 
as discussed further below  we completed enrollment in a phase i clinical trial for prochymal in march  this trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prochymal to restore heart function in patients experiencing a first time heart attack 
a heart attack  or acute myocardial infarction ami  occurs when coronary arteries become blocked with fatty deposits  depriving the heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients 
based on statistics published in by the american stroke association and the american heart association  in the united states approximately  individuals each year experience their first heart attack 
according to these same statistics  approximately of patients experiencing their first heart attack suffer extensive damage to their heart muscle  leading to heart failure within six years 
furthermore  we believe the statistics indicate that despite improvements in the standard of care  this progression from myocardial infarction to heart failure remains largely unavoidable in patients with amis 
prochymal is being developed for the treatment of heart muscle damage following ami 
its primary indication is to treat post ami complications and prevent the formation of scar tissue and associated cardiac dysfunction 
our preclinical studies indicate that the mechanism by which prochymal improves myocardial function includes the prevention of pathological scarring of the heart muscle and the formation of new blood vessels 
we are developing prochymal as a therapy to be delivered through a standard intravenous line up to days post myocardial infarction 
in preclinical studies  prochymal selectively targeted the damaged area of the heart when a single infusion was administered 
these studies also indicated that prochymal has the effect of retarding or stopping the progression of further cardiac tissue deterioration and limiting the damage caused by an ami 
significant improvements in cardiac function as demonstrated by increased ejection fraction  reduced end diastolic pressures  and reduced wall stress were observed eight to ten weeks after administration of prochymal 
a preclinical study was performed to determine if an intravenous infusion of mscs following myocardial infarction would result in an improvement in cardiac function 
significant improvement in cardiac function as indicated by left ventricular ejection fraction was observed three months after infarct in those animals receiving intravenous delivery of mscs compared to control animals 
mscs were detected in the damaged area of the heart muscle of prochymal treated animals  but not in the remote  undamaged regions 
in march  we completed enrollment of a patient phase i randomized  double blind  placebo controlled clinical study to evaluate prochymal in patients following ami 
the trial was designed to investigate patient response to three different doses of prochymal or placebo 
exploratory efficacy endpoints included overall improvement in the function and remodeling of the heart muscle six months after treatment 
a safety evaluation for each subject will be conducted two years after the subject is enrolled in the trial 
in march  we reported six month results in this trial 
heart attack patients receiving prochymal had significantly lower rates of adverse events  such as cardiac arrhythmias  as well as significant improvements in heart  lung and global function 
administration of prochymal was found to be well tolerated at all dose levels 
patients in the prochymal group were four times less likely to experience an arrhythmic event compared to those receiving placebo vs 
 p 
fewer patients experienced clinically significant premature ventricular contractions after receiving prochymal as compared to placebo at the one month vs 
 p and two month vs 
 p time points 
patients with anterior wall myocardial infarctions had a statistically significant point improvement in ejection fraction at three months and a point improvement at six months over baseline p 
in comparison  placebo patients in this group did not have a significant increase 
patients receiving prochymal had significantly improved pulmonary function as measured by improvement in fev predicted values point prochymal vs 
point placebo  p 
significantly more patients who received prochymal experienced improvement in their overall condition at six months as compared to those receiving placebo vs 
 p 
in february  we reported interim results at the one year time point in the phase i trial 
the trial continued to demonstrate prochymal s strong safety profile as well as continued statistically significant improvement in heart function 
one year magnetic resonance imaging mri data on left ventricular ejection fraction lvef was collected and patients treated with prochymal showed a statistically significant point increase over baseline p 
patients receiving placebo showed only a point improvement over baseline  which was not statistically significant 
patients with more severe myocardial infarction  defined as a baseline lvef of or less  demonstrated even greater effects 
the prochymal treatment group showed a point improvement one year post treatment  compared to a point increase in the placebo group 
prochymal treated patients continued to experience fewer adverse events at a rate of per patient  compared to per patient in the placebo group 
this one year interim analysis was performed as a part of the full two year follow up  and as a result  contains only limited data 
based upon the positive results from the phase i trial  we received approval from the fda to initiate a phase ii trial 
type diabetes we are also investigating prochymal as a treatment for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
type diabetes  commonly known as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes  is an autoimmune disorder that attacks and destroys insulin producing islet cells in the pancreas causing glucose accumulation in the blood 
as a result  those suffering from type diabetes must take insulin to regulate blood sugar levels 
over time  poorly controlled diabetes can lead to serious health conditions  including heart disease  stroke  blindness  amputations  kidney disease and nerve damage 
currently  there are no preventative measures for type diabetes 
in preclinical research  both animal and human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells mscs were shown to preserve beta cell function in animal models of diabetes 
in october  we reported the initiation of a phase ii trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of prochymal in conjunction with standard of care in preserving insulin production in patients recently diagnosed with type diabetes mellitus 
the trial is double blind  placebo controlled and will target the enrollment of patients 
patients in the study will receive three intravenous infusions of prochymal over the course of sixty days 
the primary endpoint of the trial is the measurement of c peptide produced during a mixed meal tolerance test in patients treated with prochymal  compared to those receiving placebo 
this test is frequently used in diabetic patients to determine how much insulin is being produced by the pancreas in response to glucose stimulation 
the patients in the trial will be followed for safety and efficacy for two years chondrogen chondrogen is our biologic drug candidate for regeneration of meniscus  a type of cartilage that cushions the knee joint 
there are currently no fda approved products available to regenerate meniscal tissue 
in several preclinical studies  chondrogen  a preparation of adult stem cells formulated for direct injection into the knee  regenerated meniscus and prevented osteoarthritis in animal models 
as described further below  at the end of the first quarter of we completed enrollment in a phase i ii clinical trial for chondrogen  designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in patients following surgery to remove torn meniscus 
the meniscus is a crescent shaped cushion in the knee joint that protects cartilage and enables the knee to move smoothly 
injury and tears to the meniscus are common and can be traumatic  arising from sports injury for example  or degenerative  due to daily wear and tear 
an injured or torn meniscus is painful and typically requires surgical intervention 
the current standard of care for significant injuries is partial meniscectomy surgery  in which the damaged portion of the meniscus is permanently removed 
according to a article in the american journal of sports medicine  approximately million people have surgery to remove damaged or torn meniscus in the united states each year 
as noted in a article in the journal sports medicine  patients who have had this procedure are to times more likely to develop osteoarthritis  a highly debilitating orthopedic condition 
as a result  a significant medical need exists for a product that can regenerate the meniscal tissue removed during surgery and prevent cartilage degeneration 
at the end of the first quarter of  we completed a randomized double blind  placebo controlled phase i ii clinical trial evaluating chondrogen for safety and preliminary efficacy based upon regeneration of meniscus at six months 
we plan on evaluating each patient for safety two years after the patient enrolled in the trial 
participants in the trial received one of two doses of chondrogen or placebo  and a total of patients were treated 
at the six month time point  chondrogen met its primary endpoint  demonstrating product safety 
an initial review of the data showed that chondrogen was well tolerated  was not associated with serious adverse events  did not result in any adverse hematological events  and did not result in the formation of any unwanted or ectopic tissue 
there was no significant change in the volume of meniscus on mri at six months in patients that received chondrogen compared to those patients receiving placebo 
however  about of patients treated with chondrogen demonstrated an improvement in their baseline cartilage or joint condition  while no patients in the placebo group demonstrated similar improvement 
in november  we reported one year data for the phase i ii chondrogen trial 
the data continued to show improvements in joint condition that correlated with a clinically and statistically significant improvement in pain in patients with osteoarthritis oa who received chondrogen as compared to those treated with the control  hyaluronic acid ha 
patients receiving the control were times more likely to experience degenerative bone changes associated with oa as compared to those receiving chondrogen 
the effects were dose dependent and pain scores improved from six months to one year following treatment  suggesting chondrogen caused a biological modification of patients oa 
patients will be followed for safety and additional preliminary efficacy  such as cartilage damage and changes in the meniscus for two years under the current study protocol

under the terms of the agreement  jdrf has agreed to fund million of the research costs  payable to us based upon the achievement of established milestones 
we expect to earn million during from the agreement  and million during blackstone medical  inc distribution agreement in november  we entered into a distribution and supply arrangement for osteocel with blackstone medical  inc  or blackstone 
blackstone has since been acquired and now operates as a division of orthofix international  nv blackstone has the right to distribute osteocel in the united states for the treatment of spinal injuries or diseases 
in addition  we granted blackstone an exclusive distribution right with regard to spinal implant manufacturers provided that it commits to purchase at least of the quarterly production forecast of osteocel at a stipulated price per unit 
blackstone markets osteocel under the trinity name 
we have also retained the right to directly market and distribute osteocel under the osteocel brand 
blackstone is required to use its best efforts to distribute osteocel 
unless earlier terminated  the agreement terminates on december   however  it can be renewed for one year periods so long as blackstone achieves certain predetermined performance objectives 
either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party of the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events or failure to remedy a material breach that continues for more than days 
boston scientific corporation research  development and commercialization collaboration in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with boston scientific corporation  or boston scientific  to develop applications of our msc technology to treat acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischemia 
in connection with this collaboration  we granted to boston scientific a worldwide  exclusive license to develop  market and distribute msc products in the covered field 
boston scientific paid a million licensing fee to us upon the effectiveness of the license  and lent us million under a line of credit that was established in connection with the collaborative agreement 
in conjunction with this collaboration  boston scientific made a million investment in our preferred stock  which converted at the closing of our initial public offering into  shares of our common stock 
in december  we terminated the research  development and commercialization collaborative agreements with boston scientific and regained the worldwide rights to cardiac indications 
upon termination of the agreements  the outstanding amounts due under the line of credit  together with accrued interest were converted into a one year promissory note which is payable in quarterly installments beginning in january intellectual property we have established a considerable patent position in adult stem cell technology 
we currently own or have exclusive licenses to approximately issued us patents 
foreign counterparts to these patents  including composition of matter claims  have been filed  and we own or hold licenses to approximately issued patents in europe  canada  australia and other countries 
the patents and patent licenses included in our portfolio address the composition and therapeutic use of mesenchymal stem cells 
we are committed to protecting our intellectual property position and to aggressively pursue our patent portfolio  and have approximately additional us patent applications pending and approximately foreign patent applications on file but not yet allowed 
for most of our biologic drug candidates  we rely on multiple patents in combination 
through our experience with mscs and msc based product development  we have developed expertise and know how in this field 
we manufacture clinical grade mscs in house and contract for the production through contract manufacturers 
to protect this non patentable know how  our policies require confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  contractors  manufacturers  outside collaborators  sponsored researchers  and advisors 
these agreements generally provide for protection of confidential information  restrictions on the use of materials and assignment of inventions conceived during the course of performance for us 
these agreements might not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information 
we were founded on the basis of msc technology obtained from case western reserve university  or cwru 
in january  we entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with cwru  which was subsequently amended in october and twice in october pursuant to this license agreement certain patents were assigned to us and others were exclusively licensed to us  with the right to grant sublicenses 
the exclusive license is subject to any rights of a governmental agency based on research funding by such an agency  and to cwru s retained rights under the patents for non clinical research  testing or educational purposes of cwru 
with respect to the patents licensed to us  we are obligated to pay royalties to cwru based on sales of products covered by granted licensed patents  and such royalties commence with respect to each such product on the third anniversary of the initial sale thereof 
we are also obligated to pay minimum royalties under the agreement with cwru 
we are responsible for patent costs and along with cwru have the right to enforce licensed patents 
the license is terminable by cwru in the event that there is a material breach by us 
otherwise the license is for the life of the patents 
under certain circumstances  we are obligated to negotiate in good faith with a third party a sublicense under patents licensed from cwru and under patents and know how owned by us that are reasonably required by the third party to exercise the granted sublicense 
we are not obligated to grant such a sublicense where it would have a potential adverse effect on a product being researched  developed or commercialized by us or by a licensee or sub licensee of ours 
under terms of a marketing  collaboration and license agreement with lonza  we have licensed our msc technology to lonza to sell mscs  the msc descendants  cells produced from mscs and materials used with mscs for commercial and non commercial research purposes 
under the terms of this agreement  lonza is specifically precluded from selling the licensed products for use in humans 
we receive royalties on any sales under this agreement 
patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application or the date of patent issuance and other factors as promulgated under patent law 
the united states drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  known as the hatch waxman act  permits a patent extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the fda regulatory review process 
the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application or ind and the submission date of a new drug application or nda  plus the time between the submission date of an nda and the approval of the drug 
only the earliest patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension 
the united states patent and trademark office  in consultation with the fda  reviews and approves applications for patent term extension 
we expect to apply for patent term extensions for eligible patents to add patent life beyond the expiration date  depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application 
manufacturing production of biologic drug candidates we believe that we have differentiated ourselves from other stem cell companies through proprietary manufacturing methods that allow for the controlled growth of mscs to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
this is in contrast to most other stem cell technologies that are able to make only a single treatment from each donation 
we have been manufacturing mesenchymal stem cells for over nine years 
the first material manufactured in house was released in since that time manufacturing has continued to improve in support of clinical trials 
the current manufacturing process utilizes cell factories  a closed system of surfaces on which the cells adhere  for stem cell expansion 
we have developed this technology into a reproducible process that can be scaled up at additional sites 
a second manufacturing site was successfully qualified in in addition  jcr pharmaceuticals  our partner in japan  has successfully implemented our manufacturing technology in japan 
we believe that we perform all of our manufacturing activities in compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice requirements 
our manufacturing process begins with the collection of bone marrow aspirate from qualified volunteer donors  years of age 
prior to donation  these individuals are screened and tested for a battery of diseases including hiv and hepatitis according to the fda s donor suitability guidance 
we purchase bone marrow aspirate from commercial sources 
since the mesenchymal stem cell is extremely rare  accounting for only one in every  cells in bone marrow  an initial purification process is required 
upon arrival at our facilities  mscs are isolated and selectively removed from the bone marrow through a multi step process 
a beneficial feature of our stem cells is that they adhere to the surface of the cell factory and the other remaining cell populations do not adhere and are washed away throughout the process 
our stem cells are then expanded  harvested  packaged and cryopreserved as an in process intermediate  and we conduct a second battery of quality testing 
each packaged intermediate is further expanded and formulated to produce the final product 
sterility and quality testing completes the process 
this well defined process has allowed for the development of a supply chain where material specifications have been established and vendors have been qualified 
the final product will be configured to allow for ease of storage  distribution and use in the clinic 
we expect the product will be provided in ready to use patient dose quantities  shipped from the distribution center on dry ice  and stored in the freezer at the pharmacy 
production of osteocel osteocel is a matrix of viable cancellous bone containing primary or unexpanded mscs 
unlike our biologic drug candidates  the stem cells and cancellous bone used in osteocel are obtained from organ and tissue donors 
additionally  the production of osteocel is different from our biologic drug candidates in that it does not feature the expansion of mscs 
since its introduction into the marketplace in july  we have been unable to produce osteocel in quantities sufficient to meet our customer demand due to constraints in our manufacturing facility and the lack of sufficient quantities of marrow rich bone 
we contract with tissue recovery agencies for osteocel source tissue 
we currently have ten agencies under contract  including allosource as discussed above 
these agencies in turn have contracts with federally designated organ procurement organizations who notify the agencies of donor candidates in their areas 
once an initial qualification of the donor is performed  a surgical team is deployed to remove the tissue and send it to our processing center via overnight delivery 
the agencies also compile the donor s medical records  perform a medical and social history evaluation  collect serum samples for serological testing and perform other donor screening services 
these agencies operate on a fee for service basis  which varies depending upon the tissue type and transplant suitability 
we intend to enter into contracts with additional tissue recovery agencies in the future in order to fulfill product demand 
we expect to continue to increase manufacturing capacities in line with tissue supply  and believe we will eventually be limited by available donor material regardless of manufacturing capacity 
the processing of osteocel is in many ways more like the process of organ donation than standard tissue processing 
this is because it is essential that the stem cells contained within osteocel are kept in a living  healthy state 
we overcome this challenge through a proprietary process that is designed to preserve the material  particularly the stem cells 
sterility cultures are performed on the final product from every lot according to united states pharmacopeia standards 
following completion of quality control testing and quality assurance review  the product is released for distribution 
sales  marketing and distribution our current sales network consists of approximately independent sales representatives and a distribution agreement with blackstone medical  inc  and its affiliates  for the distribution of osteocel 
in addition  to ensure that osteocel is made available to the communities from which it is sourced  our agreements with allosource and tissue banks international enables these agencies to act as a non exclusive distributor of osteocel in their local donor communities 
to increase osteocel s market penetration  we intend to further expand our network of sales professionals in the united states 
we intend to self commercialize all of our biologic drug candidates in the united states upon fda approval through the creation of additional sales and marketing capabilities in existing and new indications and the leverage of osteocel s sales and marketing infrastructure for orthopedic indications 
we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
for the distribution of prochymal for gvhd in japan following marketing approval 
both our osteocel product and our biologic drug candidates have long term storage requirements within specific frozen temperature ranges  degrees centigrade and degrees centigrade  respectively 
generally  we do not believe this will pose a significant problem for end users as most hospitals and medical centers have freezers with these storage capabilities readily available 
however  some facilities may not have this type of storage available and this may limit product and biologic drug candidate distribution 
in an effort to mitigate potential issues with product and biologic drug candidate storage  we are performing studies to develop less restrictive storage temperatures 
for example  we have implemented temporary degree centigrade storage of osteocel for up to two weeks  which opens distribution to a wider hospital base 
osteocel our marketing of osteocel is targeted to orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons practicing in the united states 
the most rapid adoption rates to date have been for spinal fusion procedures 
osteocel is currently distributed by our corporate partner  blackstone medical  inc  and its affiliates  and is also distributed by allosource  tissue banks international and for us by an independent network of approximately sales representatives 
blackstone is a designer and manufacturer of spinal instruments and implants located in massachusetts 
in the field of orthopedics  we intend to continue to develop a network of sales professionals for the distribution of osteocel 
prochymal upon fda approval of prochymal for gvhd indications  we expect to focus our sales and marketing efforts on the approximately transplantation hospitals in the united states that are registered with the international bone marrow transplantation registry 
we expect to employ a number of sales representatives  initially targeting the most active transplantation centers in a region 
an important component of the sales strategy will be to gain the support of key opinion leaders  facilitating the adoption of prochymal as the treatment strategy for gvhd 
we have entered into a license agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals that grants it the exclusive right to distribute prochymal for the treatment of gvhd in japan when it has been approved for marketing in that country 
competition our industry is subject to rapid and intense technological change 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding  both in the us and abroad 
some of these competitors are pursuing the development of drugs and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we target in our commercial  clinical and preclinical programs 
many of the companies competing against us have financial and other resources substantially greater than our own 
in addition  many of our competitors have significantly greater experience in testing pharmaceutical and other therapeutic products  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and marketing and selling those products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed more rapidly than we will in obtaining fda approval for products and achieving widespread market acceptance 
if we obtain necessary regulatory approval and commence significant commercial sales of our products  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited or no commercial scale experience 
our commercialized product  osteocel  currently competes with established treatment options such as autograft bone and medtronic s infuse and potentially may compete with other products currently in development for the same indications 
our two biologic drug candidates  if approved  would compete with several marketed products and other future biologic drug candidates 
for our existing product and each of our clinical stage biologic drug candidates  the primary competitors include osteocel 
our commercialized bone regeneration product competes with autograft bone  synthetic biomaterials  growth factors and allograft bone 
competing products include medtronic s infuse  stryker s op  numerous bone void filler products such as zimmer s copios and autologous bone marrow products such as depuy spine s cellect 
prochymal 
if approved  prochymal will likely be the first drug indicated for the treatment of acute gvhd 
the competitive landscape in crohn s disease is more crowded and if approved  prochymal will compete with johnson johnson s remicade  abbott s humira and biogen s tysabri chondrogen 
if approved  chondrogen will compete with products such as allograft menisci from cadavers  conmed linvatec s meniscal fixation system of screws and arrows and if approved  regen biologics collagen meniscus implant 
we may face competition in the future from other companies that are researching and developing stem cell therapies 
we are aware of many companies working in this area  including aastrom biosciences  advanced cell technology  athersys  cellerant therapeutics  cognate therapeutics  cytori therapeutics  gamida cell  geron  mesoblast  multicell technologies  neuronyx  theradigm  viacell and stemcells 
we expect to compete based upon  among other things  our intellectual property portfolio and the efficacy of our products 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced scientific  clinical development and executive personnel  to identify and develop viable biologic drug candidates and to exploit these products and compounds commercially before others are able to develop competitive products 
in addition  our stem cell therapies may be expensive as compared to other therapies and this may make it more difficult for us to compete with other pharmaceuticals government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacture  commercialization and reimbursement of our products and services 
virtually all of the products we develop will require marketing approval  or licensure  by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the us food and drug administration  or fda  and similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping related to such products and their marketing 
state  local and other authorities may also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money  and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted 
fda approval process we believe that osteocel is appropriately characterized as a product regulated by the fda as a human cells  tissues and cellular and tissue based product  for which the fda does not require premarket approval 
see the discussion below under the caption human cellular and tissue based product 
our biologic drug candidates will require approval from the fda and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed 
the fda regulates human therapeutic products in one of three broad categories biologics  drugs  or medical devices 
our biologic drug candidates will be regulated as biological products 
the fda generally requires the following steps for premarket approval or licensure of a new biological product or new drug product preclinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with the fda s good laboratory practice  or glp  requirements to assess a drug s biological activity and to identify potential safety problems  and to characterize and document the product s chemistry  manufacturing controls  formulation  and stability  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug or ind application  which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin  obtaining approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the biologic drug candidate into humans in clinical trials  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with the fda s good clinical practice  or gcp  requirements  compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp regulations and standards  submission to the fda of a biologics license application  or bla  or new drug application  or nda  for marketing that includes adequate results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  fda review of the marketing application in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe  effective and potent for its intended uses  and obtaining fda approval of the bla or nda  including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cgmp requirements  prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent 
typically  clinical testing involves a three phase process although the phases may overlap 
in phase i  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body 
in phase ii  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
in some cases  an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution  in which case it is referred to as a phase i ii trial 
phase iii clinical trials are generally large scale  multi center  comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy  as well as safety and potency 
in some circumstances  the fda may require phase iv or post marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market 
during all phases of clinical development  regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities  clinical data and clinical trial investigators 
an agency may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process 
all adverse events must be reported to the fda 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing on a non biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the fda in the nda or bla 
in the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies  the results of clinical trials are submitted as a bla 
in responding to the submission of a bla or nda  the fda may grant marketing authority  request additional clinical data or deny approval if the fda determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
fda review of a bla or nda typically takes one to three years  but may last longer  especially if the fda asks for more information or clarification of information already provided 
further clinical trials may be required to gain approval to promote the use of the product for any additional indications 
such additional indications are obtained through the approval of a supplemental bla or nda 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy  uncertain  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
each nda or bla must be accompanied by a user fee  pursuant to the requirements of the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  and its amendments 
the fda adjusts the pdufa user fees on an annual basis 
according to the fda s fee schedule  effective through september   the user fee for an application requiring clinical data  such as an nda or bla  is  pdufa also imposes an annual product fee for prescription drugs and biologics  and an annual establishment fee  on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics 
fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances  including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business 
additionally  no user fees are assessed on ndas or blas for products designated as orphan drugs  unless the drug also includes a non orphan indication  and if a contract manufacturer is used  the contract manufacturer is responsible for the establishment fee 
before approving an nda or bla  all facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of products must comply with applicable fda regulations governing cgmp 
a local field division of the fda is responsible for completing this inspection and providing recommendation for or against approval 
this effort is intended to assure appropriate facility and process design to avoid potentially lengthy delays in product approvals due to inspection deficiencies 
similarly  before approving a new drug or biologics application  the fda may also conduct pre licensing inspections of a company  its contract research organizations and or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical  safety  quality control and other regulated activities are compliant with gcp 
to assure such cgmp and gcp compliance  the applicants must incur significant time  money and effort in the area of training  record keeping  production  and quality control 
following approval  the manufacture  holding  and distribution of a product must continue to devote significant resources to maintain full compliance in these areas 
after fda approval has been obtained  the fda will require post marketing reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug 
further studies may be required to provide additional data on the product s risks  benefits  and optimal use  and will be required to gain approval for the use of the product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested 
results of post marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the product 
further  if there are any modifications to the drug  including changes in indication  labeling  or a change in the manufacturing process or manufacturing facility  an nda or bla supplement may be required to be submitted to the fda 
additionally  after the fda has authorized a drug product to enter commercial distribution  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include  among others  the cgmps  which require manufacturers to follow extensive design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process  labeling regulations  the fda s general prohibition against promoting drug products for unapproved or off label uses  and adverse event reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their drug may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury 
the fda has broad post market and regulatory and enforcement powers 
failure to comply with the applicable us drug regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees  civil penalties  refunds  recalls or seizures of products which would result in the cessation or reduction of production volume  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications  and criminal prosecution 
adverse events related to a drug product in any existing or future markets could cause regulatory authorities to withdraw market approval for such product 
fast track and orphan drug designations congress enacted the food and drug administration modernization act of in part to ensure the availability of safe and effective drugs  biologics  and medical devices by expediting the fda review process for new products 
the modernization act establishes a statutory program for the approval of fast track products  including biologics 
a fast track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition 
under the fast track program  the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the fda to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product 
this designation assures access to fda personnel for consultation throughout the development process and provides an opportunity to request priority review of a marketing application providing a six month review timeline for the designated product 
if a preliminary review of the clinical data suggests that a fast track product may be effective  the fda may initiate review of sections of a marketing application for a fast track product before the sponsor completes the application 
this rolling review is available if the applicant provides a schedule for submission of remaining information and pays applicable user fees 
however  the time periods specified under pdufa concerning timing goals to which the fda has committed in reviewing an application do not begin until the sponsor submits the complete application 
during the first quarter of the fda designated prochymal as a fast track product for the treatment of gvhd 
prochymal also received fast track designation from the fda in january for the treatment of refractory crohn s disease 
we cannot predict whether this designation will impact the timing or likelihood of fda approval of prochymal 
the orphan drug act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than  persons in the united states at the time of application for orphan drug designation 
the first developer to receive fda marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product as well as a waiver of the bla user fee 
however  a drug that the fda considers to be clinically superior to  or different from  another approved orphan drug  even though for the same indication  may also obtain approval in the united states during the seven year exclusive marketing period 
the fda granted orphan drug designation for prochymal during the last quarter of legislation similar to the orphan drug act has been enacted in countries other than the united states  including the european union 
the orphan legislation in the european union is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of  persons 
the marketing exclusivity period is for ten years  although that period can be reduced to six years if  at the end of the fifth year  available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity 
human cellular and tissue based product human cells or tissue intended for implantation  transplantation  infusion  or transfer into a human recipient is regulated by the fda as human cells  tissues  and cellular and tissue based product  or hct ps 
we believe that osteocel is appropriately characterized as an hct p and not as a biologic or drug 
hct ps are regulated differently from drug or biologic products due to the fact they are minimally manipulated tissues intended for homologous use in the patient s body  are not combined with a drug  device or biologic  and do not have systemic or metabolic effects on the body 
the fda does not require premarket approval for hct ps  however  it does require strict adherence to federally mandated current good tissue practice  or cgtp  regulations 
these regulations are analogous to the gmp regulations described above in terms of manufacturing standards 
in addition  the fda s regulations include other requirements to prevent the introduction  transmission and spread of communicable disease 
specifically  the fda s regulations require tissue establishments to register and list their hct ps with the fda and to evaluate donors through screening and testing 
we maintain state licensure as a human tissue bank in maryland  california  florida  illinois and new york 
these are the only states in which such licensure is required for us 
privacy law federal and state laws govern our ability to obtain and  in some cases  to use and disclose data we need to conduct research activities 
through the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress required the department of health and human services to issue a series of regulations establishing standards for the electronic transmission of certain health information 
among these regulations were standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
most health care providers were required to comply with the privacy rule as of april  hipaa does not preempt  or override  state privacy laws that provide even more protection for individuals health information 
these laws requirements could further complicate our ability to obtain necessary research data from our collaborators 
in addition  certain state privacy and genetic testing laws may directly regulate our research activities  affecting the manner in which we use and disclose individuals health information  potentially increasing our cost of doing business  and exposing us to liability claims 
in addition  patients and research collaborators may have contractual rights that further limit our ability to use and disclose individually identifiable health information 
claims that we have violated individuals privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations  even if we are not found liable  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
other regulations in addition to privacy law requirements and regulations enforced by the fda  we also are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including chemicals  micro organisms and various radioactive compounds used in connection with our research and development activities 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the occupational safety and health act  the toxic test substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot assure you that accidental contamination or injury to employees and third parties from these materials will not occur 
we may not have adequate insurance to cover claims arising from our use and disposal of these hazardous substances 
foreign regulation we will most likely have to obtain approval for the manufacturing and marketing of each of our products from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval procedure varies among countries  may involve additional preclinical testing and clinical trials  and the time required may differ from that required for fda approval or licensure 
although there is now a centralized european union approval mechanism in place  this applies only to certain specific medicinal product categories 
in respect of all other medicinal products  each european country may impose certain of its own procedures and requirements in addition to those requirements set out in the appropriate legislation  many of which could be time consuming and expensive 
although data requirements presently exist for gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products  additional european approval standards for cellular therapy are still under development  and consequently approval of cell therapy products in europe may require additional data that we may not be able to satisfy

risk factors 
risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and expect to experience losses over the next several years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to complete our phase iii clinical trials for prochymal for gvhd and crohn s disease  complete our phase i ii clinical trial for chondrogen  and  if supported by the phase i ii clinical trial  initiate additional clinical trials  complete our phase i clinical trial for prochymal for cardiac indications  and  if supported by the phase i clinical trial  initiate phase ii clinical trials  complete our phase ii clinical trial for prochymal for type diabetes  and  if supported by the phase ii clinical trial  initiate phase iii clinical trials  complete our preclinical studies for prochymal for acute radiation syndrome  and  if supported by the preclinical studies  initiate further studies  maintain and expand our network of sales professionals for the distribution of osteocel  and further expand and train our sales network in anticipation of the approval of our biologic drug candidates for commercial sale  expand our manufacturing capacity  which will require that we obtain additional administrative and manufacturing space and build out a portion of that space as a food and drug administration  or fda  compliant and validated product manufacturing facility  complete the relocation of all of our business operations to our columbia  maryland leased facility  maintain  expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio  hire additional clinical  quality control  scientific and management personnel  and add operational  financial  accounting  facilities engineering and information systems personnel  consistent with expanding our operations and our status as a public company 
in addition  osteocel is our only commercially available product 
while revenue from osteocel has increased since its commercial introduction in july  our ability to scale up our production capabilities for commercial quantities of this product are limited  and our costs in marketing and distributing this product will also increase as production increases 
the extent of our future operating losses or profits is highly uncertain  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability  the market value of our common stock will decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
if we are not able to recruit and retain qualified management and scientific personnel  we may fail in developing our technologies and biologic drug candidates 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of the principal members of our scientific  management and sales personnel 
these members include c 
randal mills  phd  harry e 
carmitchel  michelle l 
williams  phd  philip r 
jacoby  jr  earl r 
fender and lode debrabandere phd the loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
we have entered into employment agreements with dr 
mills  messrs 
carmitchel  fender and dr 
debrabandere 
the existence of an employment agreement does not  however  guarantee retention of these employees  and we may not be able to retain those individuals for the duration of or beyond the end of their respective terms 
except for dr 
mills  messrs 
carmitchel  fender and dr 
debrabandere  none of our employees is employed for a specified term 
competition for personnel is intense 
we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or integrate other qualified management and scientific personnel in the future 
we may not be able to raise additional capital necessary to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level of cash flows from osteocel sales  the scope and results of our research and preclinical development programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  particularly regarding the number of patients required for our phase iii trials for prochymal  the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our biologic drug candidates  which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug  given the fda s limited experience with late stage clinical trials and marketing approval for stem cell therapeutics  the costs of building and operating our manufacturing facilities  both in the near term to support osteocel sales and our clinical activities and also in anticipation of expanding our commercialization activities  the costs of maintaining  expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  including potential litigation costs and liabilities  our debt repayment obligations  and the costs of enlarging our work force consistent with expanding our business and operations and status as a public company  and as necessary to enhance and train our sales network in anticipation of the approval of our biologic drug candidates for commercial sale 
as a result of these factors  we may need or choose to seek additional funding prior to our becoming cash flow positive on an operational basis 
we would likely seek such funding through public or private financings or some combination of them 
we might also seek funding through collaborative arrangements if determined to be necessary or appropriate 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we obtain capital through collaborative arrangements  these arrangements could require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or biologic drug candidates 
if we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt  we would likely become subject to covenants restricting our business activities  and holders of debt instruments would have rights and privileges senior to those of our equity investors 
in addition  servicing the interest and repayment obligations under these borrowings would divert funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development  clinical or commercialization activities 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the potential of our stem cell therapies to treat diseases is not realized  the value of our technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced 
the potential of our stem cell therapies to treat diseases is currently being explored by us 
we have not proven in clinical trials that our stem cell therapy will be a safe and effective treatment for any disease 
our stem cell therapies are susceptible to various risks  including undesirable and unintended side effects  unintended immune system responses  inadequate therapeutic efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their marketing approval or commercial use 
we have not treated a sufficient number of patients to allow us to make a determination that serious unintended consequences will not occur 
if the potential of our stem cell therapies to treat disease is not realized  the value of our technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced 
because our biologic drug candidates are based on mscs  any negative developments regarding the therapeutic potential or side effects of mscs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky 
we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new technologies 
the novel nature of our therapeutics creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization  manufacturing  government regulation  third party reimbursement and market acceptance 
for example  the fda has relatively limited experience with stem cell therapies 
none has been approved by the fda for commercial sale  and the pathway to regulatory approval for our biologic drug candidates may accordingly be more complex and lengthy 
additionally  stem cells are subject to donor to donor variability  which can make standardization more difficult 
as a result  the development and commercialization pathway for our therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty  as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs 
there are no fda approved treatments for some of the disease indications we are pursuing 
this could complicate and delay fda approval of our biologic drug candidates 
there are no drugs or therapies currently approved with stated indications for the first line treatment of acute gvhd or the treatment of steroid refractory gvhd 
as a result  the clinical efficacy endpoints  or the criteria to measure the intended results of treatment  for our biologic drug candidate prochymal for the treatment of gvhd may be difficult to determine 
in addition  patients battling gvhd and who  therefore  are candidates for treatment with prochymal  are typically very ill as a result of an underlying genetic or oncologic condition 
due to the graveness of their underlying disease and the very serious complications and disorders that often accompany acute gvhd  many of these patients will die from causes other than gvhd prior to the completion of the study even if their gvhd responds favorably to treatment with prochymal 
the resulting reduction in the number of patients available for evaluation at the end of the study may make it more difficult for us to demonstrate efficacy  as necessary to obtain fda approval to market prochymal for commercial sale 
there are also no drugs or therapies currently approved with stated indications for the regeneration of meniscal tissue or the repair of heart muscle following heart attack 
as a result  the clinical endpoints for our biologic drug candidates prochymal and chondrogen may be difficult to determine 
in the case of prochymal for the treatment of crohn s disease  there are other products approved for the treatment of this disease  so it is expected that the clinical efficacy endpoints for prochymal for this indication will be established by comparison with these already approved treatments 
in order to obtain fda approval for this indication  we will have to demonstrate  among other things  that our biologic drug candidate is safe and effective 
the results of our clinical trials must be statistically significant  meaning that there must be sufficient data to indicate that it is unlikely the outcome occurred by chance 
these challenges may prevent us from developing and commercializing products on a timely or profitable basis  or at all 
our biologic drug candidates represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept 
even if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our biologic drug candidates  the market may not understand or accept them 
we are developing biologic drug candidates that represent novel treatments and will compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others  including major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed and potential products will depend on a number of factors  including the clinical safety and effectiveness of osteocel and our biologic drug candidates and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods  our ability to demonstrate that prochymal can have a clinically significant effect on steroid refractory gvhd  our ability to separate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with stem cell drug candidates derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue  ethical controversies that may arise regarding the use of stem cells or human tissue of any kind  including adult stem cells  adult bone marrow and other adult tissues derived from donors  in the manufacture and sale for profit of osteocel and our biologic drug candidates  adverse events involving our biologic drug candidates or the products or product candidates of others that are stem cell based  our ability to supply a sufficient amount of our product to meet regular and repeated demand in order to develop a core group of medical professionals familiar with and committed to the use of our products  and the cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
if the health care community does not accept osteocel or our potential products for any of the foregoing reasons  or for any other reason  it could affect our sales  having a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the successful commercialization of our biologic drug candidates  or any of our other potential stem cell therapeutics  will depend on obtaining reimbursement from third party payors 
if we successfully develop and obtain necessary regulatory approvals  we intend to sell our biologic drug candidates initially in the united states and europe 
in the united states  the market for any pharmaceutical product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies 
stem cell therapies like prochymal  and chondrogen may be expensive compared with standard pharmaceuticals  due to the higher cost and complexity associated with the research  development and production of stem cell therapies  the small size and large geographic diversity of the target patient population for some indications  and the complexity associated with distribution of stem cell therapies which require special handling and shipment procedures and protocols 
this  in turn  may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  particularly if we cannot demonstrate a favorable cost benefit relationship 
third party payors may also deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement for our potential products if they determine that the product has not received appropriate clearances from the fda or other government regulators or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
for example  patients battling gvhd and who  therefore  are candidates for treatment with prochymal  are typically very ill as a result of an underlying genetic or oncologic condition 
because these patients have a low probability of survival whether or not their gvhd is successfully treated  third party payors may resist reimbursing the cost of treatment 
in the countries of europe and in some other countries  the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement are subject to governmental control 
in these countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compares the cost effectiveness of our biologic drug candidates or products to other available therapies 
conducting one or more clinical trials would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our products 
managing and reducing health care costs has been a general concern of federal and state governments in the united states and of foreign governments 
although we do not believe that any recently enacted or presently proposed legislation should impact our business  we might be subject to future regulations or other cost control initiatives that materially restrict the price we receive for our products 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  and many limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products 
in particular  third party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop  which would result in lower product revenues to us 
our dependence upon a limited supply of adult marrow rich bone necessary to produce osteocel may impact our ability to produce osteocel on a large scale 
the production of osteocel does not involve an expansion of mscs and is therefore limited by the amount of adult human marrow rich bone donations that are available to us 
since the introduction of osteocel into the marketplace in july  we have been unable to obtain quantities of adult human marrow rich bone sufficient to meet the demand for osteocel 
osteocel consists of primary  or unexpanded  mscs in a matrix of viable cancellous bone 
cancellous bone is the porous and spongy inner structure of bones accounting for approximately of total bone mass 
the bone and cells are derived from human organ and tissue donors 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to provide us with sufficient amounts of viable cancellous bone to meet present or future demand for osteocel 
our inability to secure enough viable cancellous bone to meet our osteocel demands could limit our ability to successfully market and drive market acceptance of osteocel and may limit our potential revenues from osteocel 
our dependence upon a limited supply of bone marrow donors may impact our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our biologic drug candidates as necessary to complete our clinical trials  and if our trials are successful  to meet product demand 
the population of acceptable bone marrow donors is limited to volunteers between the ages of and in addition  potential donors are prescreened for a variety of health conditions and are only allowed to donate bone marrow a total of six times in their lifetime  further limiting the total number of potential donors 
the amount of bone marrow donated may be insufficient for us to mass produce our biologic drug candidates 
future government regulation or health concerns may also reduce the number of donors or otherwise limit the amount of bone marrow available to us 
if we cannot secure quantities of bone marrow sufficient to meet the manufacturing demands for our clinical trials  we might not be able to complete our clinical trials and obtain marketing approval for our biologic drug candidates 
moreover  even if our clinical trials are successful and we obtain marketing approval for our biologic drug candidates  our inability to secure enough bone marrow to meet product demand would limit our potential revenues 
osteocel and our biologic drug candidates are derived from human tissue and bone marrow sources and therefore have the potential for disease transmission 
the utilization of donated adult human cancellous bone and bone marrow creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease  including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  viral hepatitis  syphilis  creutzfeldt jakob disease  or the human form of mad cow disease  and other viral  fungal or bacterial pathogens 
although we are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission  and our suppliers of adult human bone and bone marrow are also required to comply with such regulations in connection with their collection  storage and supply to us we or our suppliers may fail to comply with such regulations  even with compliance  our products might nevertheless be viewed by the public as being associated with transmission of disease  and a patient that contracts an infectious disease might assert that the use of our products resulted in disease transmission  even if the patient became infected through another source 
any actual or alleged transmission of communicable disease could result in patient claims  litigation  distraction of management s attention and potentially increased expenses 
further  any failure in screening  whether by us or other manufacturers of similar products  could adversely affect our reputation  the support we receive from the medical community and overall demand for our products 
as a result  such actions or claims  whether or not directed at us  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with our customers and our ability to market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to manufacture osteocel in quantities sufficient to expand our market for the product and may not be able to manufacture our biologic drug candidates in quantities sufficient for later stage clinical studies or for commercial sale 
we may encounter difficulties in the production of osteocel and our biologic drug candidates due to our manufacturing capabilities 
this difficulty could reduce sales of our products  increase our costs or cause production delays  any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability 
even if we were to obtain access to quantities of adult marrow rich bone sufficient to allow us otherwise to expand our osteocel manufacturing capabilities  we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product at an acceptable cost  or at all 
if we successfully obtain marketing approval for one of our biologic drug candidates  we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product at an acceptable cost 
commercial scale production of therapies made from live human mesenchymal stem cells involves production in small batches and strict adherence to complex manufacturing and storage protocols and procedures 
our biologic drug candidates are inherently more difficult to manufacture at commercial scale than chemical pharmaceuticals  which are manufactured using precise chemical formulations and operational methods 
we use third party collaborators to help us develop and commercialize our products  and our ability to commercialize such products may be impaired or delayed if collaborations are unsuccessful 
we have arrangements in place with third party collaborators as a means to help us with research and development efforts or marketing and distribution 
for example we currently sell a large majority of our osteocel product through a distribution arrangement with blackstone medical  inc  which sells this product under the blackstone brand trinity  we have a collaboration with jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
granting to jcr an exclusive right to prochymal for the treatment of gvhd in japan  and we have a collaboration with genzyme corporation to develop effective countermeasures to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
the initial focus of the collaboration will be to develop prochymal to treat the potentially lethal complications of acute radiation syndrome 
we may enter into additional collaborations in the future 
we are dependent upon the success of our current and any future collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
the development and commercialization of our potential products will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us 
disputes with our collaborators could result in product development delays  decreased revenues and litigation expenses 
in addition  because our products may be marketed under a different brand name by our collaborators  as is the case in our relationship with blackstone  should the relationship be terminated for any reason  our product recognition could be adversely impacted  affecting our product and potentially causing brand confusion in the market 
we are dependent upon third party suppliers for services and raw materials needed for the manufacture  and we are dependent upon third parties for the distribution  of osteocel and our biologic drug candidates 
if any of these third parties fail or are unable to perform in a timely manner  our ability to manufacture and deliver will be compromised 
in order to produce our biologic drug candidates for use in clinical studies  and to produce osteocel and any other of our biologic drug candidates that may be approved for commercial sale  we require biological media  reagents and other highly specialized materials 
this is in addition to the adult marrow rich bone donations used in the manufacture of osteocel  and the bone marrow aspirate used in the manufacture of our biologic drug candidates 
these items must be manufactured and supplied to us in sufficient quantities and in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
to meet these requirements  we have entered into supply agreements with firms that manufacture these components to cgmp standards 
our requirements for these items are expected to increase if and when we transition to the manufacture of commercial quantities of our biologic drug candidates 
in addition  as we proceed with our clinical trial efforts  we must be able to demonstrate to the fda that we can manufacture our biologic drug candidates with consistent characteristics 
accordingly  we are materially dependent on these suppliers for supply of cgmp grade components of consistent quality 
our ability to complete ongoing clinical trials may be negatively affected in the event that we are forced to seek and validate a replacement source for any of these critical components 
if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of these items of consistent quality from our third party suppliers  it will also be more difficult to manufacture commercial quantities of osteocel or any of our current biologic drug candidates that may subsequently be approved for commercial sale 
in addition  we rely on third parties to distribute osteocel and  if approved  our biologic drug candidates 
proper shipping and distribution requires compliance with specific storage and shipment procedures 
for example  our products must be placed in a freezer within hours of shipment 
failure to comply with these procedures or the occurrence of inadvertent damage to the shipping container will necessitate return and replacement  potentially resulting in additional cost and causing us to fail to meet supply requirements 
use of third party manufacturers may increase the risk that we will not have adequate quantities of our biologic drug candidates 
we use third party manufacturers to supply our biologic drug candidates for clinical trials 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured such components ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party  and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
our contract manufacturers are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties that we have when we manufacture on our own 
similar to us  they are subject to ongoing  periodic  unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with cgmp regulations and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
however  we do not control compliance by our contract manufacturers with these regulations and standards 
our present or future manufacturers might not be able to comply with these regulatory requirements 
if our third party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations  the fda or other regulatory authorities could impose sanctions on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  denial of marketing approval of our biologic drug candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of biologic drug candidates or our other products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
any of these actions could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our biologic drug candidates or other products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have contracted with lonza to manufacture quantities of our stem cell drug candidates for our clinical trials 
if lonza is unable to ramp up production sufficiently  we may also not be able to meet anticipated market demand in the future 
if our processing and storage facility or our clinical manufacturing facilities are damaged or destroyed  our business and prospects would be negatively affected 
if our processing and storage facility or the equipment in the facility were to be significantly damaged or destroyed  we could suffer a loss of some or all of the stored units of our biologic drug candidates and it would force us to halt our clinical trial processes 
we have a manufacturing facility located in baltimore  maryland at which we produce and store osteocel prior to sale 
if this facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed  we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity 
this facility is located on the baltimore harbor  and in september it was flooded by hurricane isabel 
this event resulted in a temporary suspension of our manufacturing operations 
in the event of another temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment  we may be able to transfer manufacturing to a third party  but the shift would likely be expensive  and the timing would depend on availability of third party resources and the speed with which we could have a new facility comply with the necessary regulatory requirements 
such an event could halt our distribution of osteocel due to a lack of available product 
we lease approximately  square feet of space in columbia  maryland  and plan to begin manufacturing osteocel in columbia during the second quarter of we intend to move all our manufacturing and storage from baltimore to columbia during the third quarter of currently  we maintain insurance coverage totaling million against damage to our property and equipment  an additional million to cover business interruption and extra expenses  and million to cover r d restoration expenses 
if we have underestimated our insurance needs  we will not have sufficient insurance to cover losses above and beyond the limits on our policies 
ethical and other concerns surrounding the use of stem cell therapy or human tissue may negatively affect public perception of us or our products or biologic drug candidates  or may negatively affect regulatory approval of our products or biologic drug candidates  thereby reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting the market price for our common stock 
the commercial success of osteocel and our biologic drug candidates will depend in part on general public acceptance of the use of stem cell therapy and donated human tissue for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
the use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue for research and stem cell therapy has been the subject of substantial national and international debate regarding related ethical  legal and social issues 
in the us  for example  federal government funding of embryonic stem cell research has been limited to specifically identified cell lines and is not otherwise available 
we do not use embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue  but the public may not be able to  or may fail to  differentiate our use of adult stem cells from the use by others of embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue 
this could result in a negative perception of our company or our products or biologic drug candidates 
we obtain our stem cells from volunteer adult bone marrow donors and we obtain cancellous human bone for the production of osteocel from non profit organizations that collect and process human organ and tissue donations 
bone marrow donors receive payment  but payment is not received by either human organ and tissue donors or their surviving family members 
ethical concerns have been raised by some about the use of donated human tissue in a for profit setting  as we are doing 
future adverse events in the field of stem cell therapy or changes in public policy could also result in greater governmental regulation of our products and biologic drug candidates and potential regulatory delays relating to the testing or approval of our biologic drug candidates 
we compete with other companies for funding and product sales 
many of our competitors have greater resources or capabilities than we have  or may already have or succeed in developing better products or in developing products more quickly than we do  and we may not compete successfully with them 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive 
we compete for funding and  if our products become available for commercial sale  we will compete in the market place 
for funding  we compete primarily with other companies which  like us  are focused on developing novel products or therapies for the treatment of human disease based on stem cells or other novel scientific principles 
these include aastrom biosciences  advanced cell technology  athersys  cellerant therapeutics  cognate therapeutics  cytori therapeutics  gamida cell  geron  mesoblast  multicell technologies  neuronyx  theradigm  viacell  and stemcells 
in the marketplace  we compete or may eventually compete with other companies and organizations that are marketing or developing therapies for our targeted disease indications  based on traditional pharmaceutical  medical device or other  non cellular therapy and technologies 
these include johnson johnson  the manufacturer of cellect for the repair of bone  which competes with osteocel  medtronic and stryker  the manufacturers of infuse and op  respectively  which compete with osteocel  novartis  the manufacturer of neoral for the prevention of organ rejection in transplant patients  which would compete with prochymal for the treatment of gvhd  and johnson johnson  the manufacturer of remicade  and abbott  the manufacturer of humira  which would compete with prochymal for the treatment of crohn s disease 
in addition to those listed above  we have other potential competitors developing a variety of therapeutics 
we also face competition in the cell therapy field from academic institutions and governmental agencies 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and human resources than we have  including more experience in research and development and more established sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we anticipate that competition in our industry will increase 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by rapid technological change  resulting in new product introductions and other technological advancements 
our competitors may develop and market products that render our current product or any future product non competitive or otherwise obsolete 
the use of our stem cell therapies in human subjects may expose us to product liability claims  and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
we face an inherent risk of product liability claims 
neither osteocel nor any of our biologic drug candidates has been widely used over an extended period of time  and therefore our safety data are limited 
we derive the raw materials for manufacturing osteocel and our biologic drug candidates from human donor sources  the manufacturing process is complex  and the handling requirements are specific  all of which increase the likelihood of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims 
we will need to increase our insurance coverage if and when we begin commercializing our biologic drug candidates 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all 
if we are unable to obtain insurance  or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage  then our business could be adversely impacted 
whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation  such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and could result in significant awards against us  substantial litigation costs  recall of the product  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  and adverse regulatory action 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to intellectual property if our patent position does not adequately protect osteocel  our biologic drug candidates or any future products  others could compete against us more directly  which would harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our biologic drug candidates 
the patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation 
neither the us patent and trademark office nor the courts has a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology patents 
the claims of our existing us patents and those that may issue in the future  or those licensed to us  may not confer on us significant commercial protection against competing products 
third parties may challenge  narrow  invalidate or circumvent any patents we own or may obtain in the future 
our patents on msc technology  in particular  are quite broad in that they cover mesenchymal stem cells and the therapeutic use thereof 
patents with broad claims tend to be more vulnerable to challenge by other parties than patents with more narrowly written claims 
also  our pending patent applications may not issue  and we may not receive any additional patents 
further  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies 
consequently  our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
we have nine granted patents and have filed six patent applications that correspond or are related to our commercially available product  osteocel 
the six patent applications have not yet issued and there can be no assurances that they will ever issue 
osteocel is different from our other biologic drug candidates in that it contains primary  or unexpanded  mscs in a matrix of cancellous bone 
because fda approval is generally not required for tissue based products like osteocel  competitors might choose to enter this market and produce a substantially similar product whereby we may not be able to prevent the marketing and sale of any such similar products by others 
should others produce a substantially similar product  we will be subject to increased competition and our potential revenues from osteocel sales may be limited 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that  before any of our products can be commercialized  any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of the patent 
for instance  one of our base patents on msc technology will expire in to the extent our biologic drug candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date  or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such products  those products would not be protected by patents beyond the background technologies used in the development of our biologic drug candidates are known in the scientific community  and it is possible to duplicate the methods we use to create our biologic drug candidates 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know how  our competitive position would be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant amount of our technology  especially regarding manufacturing processes  is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets 
in an effort to protect these trade secrets  we require our employees  consultants  collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements  however  may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information  and these agreements may be breached 
for example  a portion of the manufacture of osteocel is protected by trade secrets 
a breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position 
in addition  in some situations  these agreements may conflict with  or be subject to  the rights of third parties with whom our employees  consultants  collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships 
also  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  it will adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our research  development and commercialization activities  including any biologic drug candidates or products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents owned by third parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
there may be applications that have been filed but not published that  when issued  could be asserted against us 
these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we are able to obtain a license  the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both  and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive  which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
all of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators  which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
for example  the patent that was granted to us in europe for human mesenchymal stem cells has been opposed in the european patent office by two different companies 
the outcome of the proceedings is uncertain at this time  but we are vigorously pursuing our rights 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace and  as a result  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors 
as a result  we may be required to file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use 
this can be expensive  particularly for a company of our size  and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we are aware of several companies that are employing mesenchymal stem cell technology in their research and product development efforts 
if such companies commercialize such products  there is no assurance that we would have a basis for initiating patent infringement proceedings or that if initiated we would prevail in such proceedings 
interference proceedings brought by the us patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management 
we may not be able  alone or with our collaborators and licensors  to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if investors perceive these results to be negative  the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed 
risks related to regulatory approval and other government regulations if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize our biologic drug candidates and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations 
in order to generate sales revenue from our biologic drug candidates  we must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate that our biologic drug candidates are safe and effective and obtain required regulatory approvals 
our early stage biologic drug candidates may fail to perform as we expect 
moreover  our biologic drug candidates in later stages of development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed successfully through preclinical or initial clinical testing 
we will need to devote significant additional research and development  financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
if our biologic drug candidates do not prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials  we will not obtain the required regulatory approvals 
if we fail to obtain such approvals  we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations 
even if we obtain regulatory approval of a product  that approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
even after granting regulatory approval  the fda and regulatory agencies in other countries continue to review and inspect marketed products  manufacturers and manufacturing facilities  which may create additional regulatory burdens 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including a withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  regulatory agencies may establish additional regulations that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
we cannot market and sell our biologic drug candidates in the united states or in other countries if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or licensure 
we cannot sell our biologic drug candidates until regulatory agencies grant marketing approval  or licensure 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
it is likely to take two to three years or more to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our lead stem cell biologic drug candidate  prochymal  or we may never gain the necessary approvals 
any difficulties that we encounter in obtaining regulatory approval may have a substantial adverse impact on our operations and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
moreover  because our biologic drug candidates are all based on a single platform technology  mscs  any adverse events in our clinical trials for one of our biologic drug candidates could negatively impact the clinical trials and approval process for our other biologic drug candidates 
to obtain marketing approvals in the united states for msc products  for instance  we must  among other requirements  complete carefully controlled and well designed clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the fda that the biologic drug candidate is safe and effective for each disease for which we seek approval 
several factors could prevent completion or cause significant delay of these trials  including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately that mscs are safe  effective and potent for use in humans 
negative or inconclusive results from or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause the clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful 
the fda can place a clinical trial on hold if  among other reasons  it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury 
if safety concerns develop  we or the fda could stop our trials before completion 
some participants in our msc clinical trial have experienced serious adverse events  four of which have been determined to be possibly related to mscs and one of which has been determined to be probably related 
a serious adverse event is an event that results in significant medical consequences  such as hospitalization  disability or death  and must be reported to the fda 
we cannot assure you that safety concerns regarding mscs will not develop 
the pathway to regulatory approval for mscs may be more complex and lengthy than for approval of a new conventional drug 
similarly  to obtain approval to market our stem cell products outside of the united states  we will need to submit clinical data concerning our products and receive regulatory approval from governmental agencies  which in certain countries includes approval of the price we intend to charge for our product 
we may encounter delays or rejections if changes occur in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a biologic drug candidate or during the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of our biologic drug candidates under development  we will not be able to commercialize such products  and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business 
if we are not able to conduct our clinical trials properly and on schedule  marketing approval by fda and other regulatory authorities may be delayed or denied 
the completion of our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated for many reasons  including  but not limited to  if the fda does not grant permission to proceed and places the trial on clinical hold  subjects do not enroll in our trials at the rate we expect  subjects experience an unacceptable rate or severity of adverse side effects  third party clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol  good clinical practice and regulatory requirements  or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  inspections of clinical trial sites by the fda or institutional review boards irbs of research institutions participating in our clinical trials  find regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action  suspend or terminate one or more sites  or prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications  or one or more irbs suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site  precludes enrollment of additional subjects  or withdraws its approval of the trial 
our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trials  or if we are required to modify  suspend  terminate or repeat a clinical trial 
if we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly and on schedule  marketing approval may be delayed or denied by the fda 
we may not be able to secure and maintain research institutions to conduct our clinical trials 
we rely on research institutions to conduct our clinical trials 
specifically  the limited number of bone marrow transplant centers further heightens our dependence on such research institutions for the phase iii prochymal trials 
our reliance upon research institutions  including hospitals and clinics  provides us with less control over the timing and cost of clinical trials and the ability to recruit subjects 
if we are unable to reach agreement with suitable research institutions on acceptable terms  or if any resulting agreement is terminated  we may be unable to quickly replace the research institution with another qualified institution on acceptable terms 
we may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research institutions to conduct our clinical trials 
final marketing approval of our biologic drug candidates by the fda or other regulatory authorities for commercial use may be delayed  limited  or denied  any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues 
any of the following factors may cause final marketing approval for our biologic drug candidates to be delayed  limited or denied our biologic drug candidates require significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before applications for marketing approval can be filed with the fda  data obtained from preclinical and nonclinical animal testing and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways  and the fda may not agree with our interpretations  it may take many years to complete the testing of our biologic drug candidates  and failure can occur at any stage of the process  negative or inconclusive results or adverse side effects during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate development efforts for a biologic drug candidate  and commercialization may be delayed if the fda requires us to expand the size and scope of the clinical trials 
if marketing approval for our biologic drug candidates is delayed  limited or denied  our ability to market products  and our ability to generate product sales  would be adversely affected 
should the fda decide that osteocel does not meet the appropriate regulatory requirements  we will be required to stop production  which will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda has developed a tiered  risk based regulatory framework  which includes criteria for facility management  quality assurance  donor selection  and processing of human cells  tissues  and cellular and tissue based products 
we believe that commercial sale of osteocel does not require pre market approval by the fda because we believe that it meets the regulatory definition of human cells  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products  or hct ps 
however  should the fda decide that osteocel does not meet the regulatory definition of hct ps  we will not be able to produce and sell osteocel until we obtain fda approval  which could take years to obtain and which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing and marketing an approved drug or other medical product is subject to significant and costly post approval regulation 
it is likely that prochymal  if approved based on our currently contemplated phase iii trial  will receive conditional approval by the fda  and we will be required to conduct phase iv clinical trials to obtain full approval 
even if we obtain full approval of a product  that approval is subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market it 
after granting marketing approval  the fda and regulatory agencies in other countries continue to review and inspect marketed products  manufacturers and manufacturing facilities  creating additional regulatory burdens 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including a withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  regulatory agencies may establish additional regulations that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our products 
our business involves the use of hazardous materials that could expose us to environmental and other liability 
we have facilities in maryland that are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including chemicals  micro organisms and various radioactive compounds used in connection with our research and development activities 
in the united states  these laws include the occupational safety and health act  the toxic test substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we cannot assure you that accidental contamination or injury to our employees and third parties from hazardous materials will not occur 
we do not have insurance to cover claims arising from our use and disposal of these hazardous substances other than limited clean up expense coverage for environmental contamination due to an otherwise insured peril  such as fire 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation for our biologic drug candidates 
some jurisdictions  including the european union and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
although the fda and its european counterpart  emea have designated prochymal for the treatment of steroid refractory gvhd as an orphan drug  none of our other biologic drug candidates have received such designation 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process  but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity  reduced filing fees and specific tax credits 
generally  if a company receives the first marketing approval for a product with an orphan drug designation in the clinical indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that the health authorities will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to seven years in the united states and ten years in europe 
this exclusivity  however  could block the approval of our biologic drug candidates if a competitor obtains marketing approval before us 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our biologic drug candidates  we may not be able to maintain it 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have will not block the approval of such competitive product 
the fast track designation for development of any of our products may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process  and it does not increase the likelihood the biologic drug candidate will receive marketing approval 
if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition  the drug sponsor may apply for fda fast track designation for a particular indication 
marketing applications filed by sponsors of products in fast track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification 
although we have obtained a fast track designation from the fda for prochymal for the treatment of gvhd and treatment refractory crohn s disease  receipt of fast track designation may not result in a faster development process  review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures 
in addition  the fda may withdraw our fast track designation at any time 
if we lose our fast track designation  the approval process may be delayed 
in addition  our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that prochymal will receive regulatory approval for the treatments of steroid refractory gvhd or crohn s disease 
risks related to government contracts federal government spending priority or our relationships with the federal government may change in a manner that harms our business or prospects 
our ability to successfully pursue development and purchase agreements with united states and allied governmental agencies for countermeasures to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies  including the contract awarded to us by the dod for the development and stockpiling of prochymal for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome ars  depends upon continued federal government expenditures on defense  emergency preparadness and other programs 
these expenditures will likely fluctuate over time 
while spending authorizations for defense and emergency preparadness related programs by the government have increased in recent years  and in particular after the terrorist attacks  future levels of expenditures and authorizations for these programs may decrease  remain constant or shift to program areas inapplicable to us 
our business  prospects  financial condition and or operating results could be materially harmed by budgetary constraints affecting federal government spending generally  or specific departments or agencies in particular  and by changes in fiscal policies or available funding  or by changes in federal government programs or requirements or delays in government appropriations process 
in addition  our business  prospects  financial condition and or operating results could be materially harmed if we are suspended or disbarred from contracting with the federal government or a significant governmental agency  or our reputation or relationship with governmental entities is impaired  or the government otherwise declines to do business with us  or significantly decreases the amount of business it is willing to do with us 
federal government contracts contain provisions that may be unfavorable to us 
federal government contracts contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these provisions may allow the government to terminate existing contracts for convenience  as well as for default  to reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  to cancel multi year contracts or related purchase orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  to decline to exercise an option to renew a multi year contract or to decline to purchase product pursuant to an option afforded under a contract 
if the government terminates a contract for convenience  we may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to the termination 
if the government terminates a contract for default  we may not recover even those amounts  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
unfavorable federal government audit results could subject us to penalties or sanctions and could impair our ability to win new contracts 
the defense contract audit agency dcaa and other government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contracts and systems 
these agencies review a contractor s performance on its contract  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s accounting  purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and managing information systems 
allegations of impropriety or deficient controls could harm our reputation and or adversely influence the award of new contracts 
any costs founds to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
therefore  a dcaa audit could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenue earned from federal government contracts 
the government may terminate our federal government contracts at any time 
federal government contracts may span one or more base years and one or more option years  and may provide the government with one or more options in respect of continued performance by us thereunder 
for example  our contract with the dod for the development and stockpiling of prochymal for the treatment of ars provides the dod with successive options for the purchase of prochymal  assuming receipt of fda approval for its use in the treatment of ars 
federal government agencies have no obligation to exercise these options unless determined to be in the best interest of the government 
additionally  federal government contracts typically contain provisions permitting the government to terminate the contract for its convenience 
a decision not to exercise an option or a decision to terminate a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
if we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations  we could incur various penalties or sanctions 
to the extent which we enter into contracts or other arrangements with the united states or other allied governments  we must comply with the laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of those contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government contracts 
in complying with these laws and regulations  we may incur additional costs  and non compliance may also allow for the assignment of additional fines and penalties  including contractual damages 
among these laws and regulations are the federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of united states federal government contracts  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all costs and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes  and restricting the export of certain products and technical data 
we are subject to periodic review of our performance under and compliance with the terms of any federal government contracts to which we are a party 
as a result of these reviews  we may learn that we are not in compliance with all of the terms of any such contracts and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions for failure of compliance 
risks related to our common stock the trading price of the shares of our common stock is highly volatile  and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
as a result of this volatility  investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it 
the market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including results of clinical trials of our biologic drug candidates or those of our competitors  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us  changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts reports or recommendations  sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders  sales of our stock by insiders and stockholders  general economic  industry and market conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  intellectual property  product liability or other litigation against us  expiration or termination of our relationships with our collaborators  and the other factors described in this risk factors section 
in addition  in the past  stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies stock 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our executive officers  directors and beneficial owners of or more of our common stock and their affiliates  in aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  these persons  acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders 
peter friedli  our chairman of the board of directors  and certain entities with which he is affiliated  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  accordingly  mr 
friedli currently has  and will continue to have  a significant influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
certain provisions of delaware law and of our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by stockholders 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and applicable provisions of delaware corporate law  may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  requirements that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the chairman of our board of directors  upon request of stockholders holding at least of our capital stock issued and outstanding  or upon a resolution adopted by  or an affirmative vote of  a majority of our board of directors  and requirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to place stockholders proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders 
we will also be afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless advance board or stockholder approval was obtained 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirors or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares
