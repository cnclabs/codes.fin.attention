item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected historical financial and operating data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fully integrated hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels primarily in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states and europe 
over our year history  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our owned hotels  our joint venture hotels  consisting of the london hotels sanderson and st martins lane  shore club and hard rock  or the joint venture hotels  our investments in hotels under development  such as mondrian las vegas  delano las vegas  mondrian chicago and mondrian soho  our investment in certain joint ventures food and beverage operations at our owned hotels and joint venture hotels  discussed further below  our management company subsidiary  mhg management company  and the rights and obligations contributed to morgans group in the formation and structuring transactions described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we consolidate the results of operations for all of our owned hotels 
certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures with restaurateur jeffrey chodorow 
the asia de cuba restaurant at mondrian scottsdale is operated under license and management agreements with china grill management  a company controlled by jeffrey chodorow 
we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of these entities because we are responsible for the majority of the entities expected losses or residual returns 
therefore  these entities are consolidated in our financial statements with our partner s share of the results of operations recorded as minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this minority interest is based upon of the income of the applicable entity after giving effect to rent and other administrative charges payable to the hotel 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at two of the joint venture hotels  sanderson and st martins lane 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 
on february   we began managing the hotel operations at the hard rock 
we also have signed agreements to manage the mondrian south beach  mondrian las vegas  delano las vegas  mondrian chicago and mondrian soho once development is complete 
as of december   we operated the following joint venture hotels under management agreements which expire as follows sanderson april with two year extensions at our option  st martins lane september with two year extensions at our option  shore club july  and hard rock february with two year extensions 
these agreements are subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
we generated net losses for the years ended december   and revenues increased by million in compared to and by million in compared to the loss for the years ended december  and is primarily due to non cash charges related to income taxes and stock compensation and the recognition of our share of losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in as compared to income in stock compensation was introduced in february when the company completed its ipo 
the stock compensation expense increased million in compared to and million in compared to further  the company purchased the hard rock through a joint venture in the company s proportionate share of hard rock s loss for the year ended was million 
we did not own any interest in hard rock in the loss for the year ended december  was primarily due to our interest expense exceeding our operating income  including prepayment fees related to a june refinancing of the debt on five hotels and increased interest due to additional mortgage debt on those five hotels 
with the refinancing of our debt on our five jointly financed united states hotel properties in june and then again in october  and after giving effect to the formation and structuring transactions related to our ipo see note to the consolidated financial statements  we experienced a reduction of million in our interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  and a further reduction in interest expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  adr  and revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the operation of our hotels 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is earned by our restaurant joint ventures and is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
other hotel revenue 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  is principally driven by hotel occupancy 
management fee related parties revenue 
we earn fees under our management agreements ranging from to of defined revenues 
these fees may include management fees as well as reimbursement for allocated chain services 
fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
we experience some seasonality in our business 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates and occupancy tend to fall when supply increases  unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
a recent trend among hotel owners is the conversion of hotel rooms to condominium apartments which further reduces the available supply of hotel rooms resulting in increased demand for the remaining hotels 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing  and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our restaurants and bars are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses  comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 
property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses consist of the cost of our corporate office  net of any cost recoveries  which consists primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expenses  office rent and legal and professional fees and costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization expense 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
other items interest expense  net 
interest expense  net includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is presented net of interest income and interest capitalized 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our united kingdom hotel joint venture  our united kingdom food and beverage joint venture both of which are owned by us  shore club in which we have a ownership interest  since august   mondrian south beach in which we have a ownership interest and which is currently under development  and since february   hard rock in which we had a ownership interest as of december  
minority interest 
minority interest expense constitutes the third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits of the restaurant ventures at certain of our hotels 
other non operating income expenses include gains and losses on sale of assets and asset restructurings  costs of abandoned development projects and financings  gain on early extinguishment of debt and other items that do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of our assets 
income tax expense 
the united states entities included in our predecessor s combined financial statements are either partnerships or limited liability companies  which are treated similarly to partnerships for tax reporting purposes 
accordingly  federal and state income taxes have not been provided for in the accompanying combined financial statements for the year ended december  as the partners or members are responsible for reporting their allocable share of our predecessor s income  gains  deductions  losses and credits on their individual income tax returns 
one of our foreign subsidiaries is subject to united kingdom corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
certain of our predecessor s subsidiaries were subject to the new york city unincorporated business tax 
income tax expense in our predecessor s financial statements comprises the income taxes paid in the united kingdom on the management fees earned by our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary 
subsequent to the ipo  the company is subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the period from february  to december  and year ended december  were computed using our calculated effective tax rate 
we also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities in the amount of million at the time of our conversion from a partnership to a c corporation 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies and certain labor such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant costs that are relatively fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 
recent trends and developments recent trends 
we believe that the economic drivers that impact underlying lodging fundamentals  such as growth in gdp  business investment and employment  are likely to weaken in the expected decline in these drivers will likely result in a significantly lower revenue growth rate for our hotels than was experienced in and while demand growth could moderate as a result of slowing economic drivers  projections for new supply in the markets in which we own hotels suggest that supply growth will also continue to fall short of long term historical averages 
although the pace of new lodging supply in various phases of development has increased over the past several quarters  the majority of new projects scheduled for completion in the near term are largely concentrated in the economy and mid scale segments and are located outside of major urban markets 
therefore  we do not expect most of the new hotel supply to directly compete with our core portfolio 
we also believe the timing of some of these projects may be affected by increased building costs and the reduced availability of financing 
these factors may further dampen the pace of new supply development beyond as we believe the trends in the lodging industry provide less opportunity for improvements in our business in  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns 
recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that a number of recent events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance 
for a discussion of these recent events  see business recent developments 
operating results comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the following table presents our operating results for the year ended december  and the year ended december   including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods

the strongest food and beverage revenue growth was achieved at royalton and clift  which achieved growth of and  respectively

other hotel revenue increased to million in as compared to million in the inclusion of mondrian scottsdale in the year ended december  resulted in a million increase 
an increase of million was attributed primarily to a change in the operations of the mondrian los angeles gift shop 
in september  mondrian los angeles began operating the gift shop rather than leasing the space out to a third party 
therefore  revenues and expenses are recorded in as compared to lease income for the majority of offsetting the increases attributed to the inclusion of mondrian scottsdale and the change in management of the mondrian los angeles gift shop  were decreases due to the continued decline of telephone revenues 
the decline in telephone revenues is an industry wide phenomenon primarily caused by the increased use of cell phones

the weighted average interest rates in and were and  respectively 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures was million of income for the year ended compared to million of loss in the income we recorded in related to our joint venture which owns the two hotels in london increased by million over the loss recorded in the increase in net income from the london joint venture is due to revpar at our london hotels which increased by in us dollars and in local currency  due primarily to the strength of the london hotel market  the refinancing of debt in november resulting in a lower interest rate  and recognition of a non cash gain of approximately million from the change in value of a derivative instrument associated with the refinanced debt 
the components of revpar from the joint venture hotels excluding hard rock for and are summarized as follows change change occupancy adr revpar other non operating expense income was million in expense for the year ended compared to million in income for year ended in  the other non operating expenses are primarily due to expense incurred in connection with the shore club litigation discussed in note of the consolidated combined financial statements and the write off of certain assets in connection with hotel renovations 
the other non operating income in relates primarily to a gain of million on the sale of tax credits 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in due primarily to the recording of a deferred tax liability as a result of difference in basis of assets and liabilities as part of the formation and structuring transaction 
we are subject to corporate federal and state income taxes effective february  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in available cash and cash equivalents 
the company has both short term and long term liquidity requirements as described in more detail below 
recent financings on july   we completed an offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares of common stock were sold by us and  shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders 
net proceeds to us as a result of the offering were approximately million 
additionally  on october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes in a private offering 
the net proceeds from the offering of the notes was million  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the company 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay in full the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and million of the net proceeds to fund the note call options and warrant transactions  as defined in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and have invested such remaining net proceeds in short term interest bearing investment grade securities 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our short term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred within the next months and believe those requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including the funding of our reserve accounts 
our reserve accounts consist of restricted cash that is swept by our lenders beginning on the ninth day of each month to fund monthly debt service payments  property  sales and occupancy taxes and insurance premiums of our hotels 
after funding these reserve accounts  we fund operating expenses and our furniture  fixtures and equipment reserve generally  approximately of total revenues at each hotel 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through existing cash balances and cash provided by our operations and  if necessary  from borrowings under our line of credit 
long term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our long term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred beyond the next months and believe these requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions and development of properties under contract and new acquisitions and development projects that we may pursue 
our long term liquidity requirements are also affected by a potential liability to a designer for which we have accrued million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  borrowings under our line of credit  and long term mortgages on our properties 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders and general market conditions 
in addition  our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive or at all 
we expect we will require additional borrowings  including borrowings under our line of credit  to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
other sources may be sales of common or preferred stock and or cash generated through property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
anticipated capital expenditures and liquidity requirements stock repurchase 
we repurchased our stock through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time

derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors

fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for share based payment transactions under sfas no 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements or remeasurements of previously computed fair values  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no

this statement permits companies and not for profit organizations to make a one time election to carry eligible types of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  even if fair value measurement is not required under gaap 
sfas no 
must be applied prospectively  and the effect of the first re measurement to fair value  if any  should be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the fasb issued a proposed fasb staff position the proposed fsp that affects the accounting for the company s convertible notes payable

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically review each property for possible impairment 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our properties taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the properties  the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities require us to make judgments on the nature of our derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported as a component of interest expense in the consolidated combined statements of operations or as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we believe our judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s fair value or effectiveness as a hedge could affect expenses  net income and equity 
consolidation policy 
we evaluate our variable interests in accordance with financial interpretation r to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures 
we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the entities because we absorb the majority of the restaurant ventures expected losses and residual returns 
therefore  the restaurant ventures are consolidated in our financial statements with our partner s share of the results of operations recorded as minority interest in the accompanying financial statements 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at two of the joint venture hotels 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted the fair value method of accounting prescribed in sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas no 
and sfas r for equity based compensation awards 
sfas r requires an estimate of the fair value of the equity award at the time of grant rather than the intrinsic value method 
all fixed equity based awards to employees and directors  which have no vesting conditions other than time of service  the fair value of the equity award at the grant date will be amortized to compensation expense over the award s vesting period on a straight line basis 
for performance based compensation plans  we recognize compensation expense at such time when the performance hurdle is anticipated to be achieved over the performance period based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of all options granted 
management s assumptions are derived based upon the risk profile of our stock and our peer group 
we review our assumptions quarterly and revise them as management deems necessary 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such valuation allowance will be estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have incurred nominal losses on the corporate tax return since inception and anticipate that we will not continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
however  these assumptions may be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december  and  there is no valuation allowance set up to against any deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding debt  including capitalized lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
we entered into hedging arrangements on million of debt which became effective on july  and cap libor at approximately

interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity

however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
currency exchange risk as we have international operations with our two london hotels  currency exchange risk between the us dollar and the british pound arises as a normal part of our business 
we reduce this risk by transacting this business in british pounds 
we have not repatriated earnings from our london hotels because of our historical net losses in our united kingdom operations and our joint venture agreement 
as a result  any funds repatriated from the united kingdom are considered a return of capital and require court approval 
we may consider repatriating certain funds in a change in prevailing rates would have  however  an impact on the value of our equity in morgans europe 
the us dollar british pound currency exchange is currently the only currency exchange rate to which we are directly exposed 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future
