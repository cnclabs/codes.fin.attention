the following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  or using different assumptions  are described below 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in 
table of contents delinquencies and charge offs  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  overall portfolio quality and specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impairment of loans we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that must be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
we regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity 
goodwill goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of the corporation s goodwill  all of which was recognized in connection with the bank s acquisition of c f finance in september  we must make assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
major assumptions used in determining impairment were increases in future income  sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
as part of the impairment test  we performed sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate  lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income 
we completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment to be recognized in if the underlying estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
defined benefit pension plan the bank maintains a non contributory  defined benefit pension plan for eligible full time employees as specified by the plan 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
the bank s actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
changes in these assumptions in the future  if any  may impact pension assets  liabilities or expense 
accounting for income taxes determining the corporation s effective tax rate requires judgment 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain 
in addition  the corporation s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual
