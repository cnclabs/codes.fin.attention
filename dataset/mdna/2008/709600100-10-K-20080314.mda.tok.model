item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for more information 
as an integral part of our securities clearing relationships  we maintain a significant margin lending business with our correspondents and their customers 
under these margin lending arrangements  we extend credit to our correspondents and their customers so that they may purchase securities on margin 
as is typical in margin lending arrangements  we extend credit for a portion of the purchase price of the securities  which is collateralized by existing securities and cash in the accounts of our correspondents and their customers 
we also earn interest income from both our securities and futures operations by investing customers cash and we engage in securities lending activities as a means of financing our business and generating additional interest income 
over the past year  our net interest revenues increased from million in to million in  representing approximately and of our net revenues  respectively 
clients currently  our principal clients are online  direct access and traditional retail brokers 
increasingly  we are adding as clients large banks  institutional brokers  financial technology companies and securities exchanges such as arca 
online broker dealers enable investors through browser based technology and perform trades through the broker via the internet 
direct access broker dealers provide investors with dedicated software which executes orders through direct exchange interfaces and provides real time high speed level ii market information 
traditional retail brokers usually engage in agency trades for their customers  which may or may not be online 
institutional brokers and hedge funds typically engage in algorithmic trading or other proprietary trading strategies for their own account or  at times  agency trades for others 
our bank clients typically are non us entities making purchases for their brokerage operations 
the type of financial technology client that would most likely use our products and services is a financial data content or trading software firm that purchases our data or combines its offerings with our trading software 
through our acquisition of goldenberg hehmeyer and co 
ghco and fcg  we have added a number of futures related clients  including introducing brokers  non clearing futures commission merchants fcms  commercial customers  customers who engage in hedging and risk management activities and other customers who trade futures and other instruments 
we have made significant investments in our us and international data and execution infrastructure  as well as various types of multi currency and multi lingual trading software 
we believe we provide a flexible offering of infrastructure products and services to our clients  available both on an unbundled basis and as a fully integrated solution 
our technology offerings are typically private labeled to emphasize the client s branding 
we seek to put our clients interests first and we believe our position as the leading independent provider of us securities clearing services is a significant differentiating factor 
we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of our significant investments in technology infrastructure to expand sales of our products and services to these and many other clients worldwide 
market opportunity we believe that the market for securities and futures processing infrastructure products and services is influenced by several significant industry trends creating continuing opportunities for us to expand our business  including increase in trading volumes and executions 
the increase in trading volumes and executions in equities  options and futures markets over the past several years has led to an increase in the number of transactions requiring execution  processing and settlement 
shift to outsourced solutions 
broker dealers outside the us are increasingly following the continuing and common practice in the us of outsourcing their clearing functions 
in addition  firms in the global securities and investment industry are expanding their use of third party technology to manage their securities trading infrastructure 

table of contents increase in trading in multiple markets 
investors increasingly seek to trade in multiple instruments  multiple markets and in multiple currencies at once 
the technological challenges associated with clearing  settlement  and custody in multiple geographies  currencies  and asset classes will push correspondents to seek the most comprehensive and sophisticated service providers 
industry consolidation 
although the significant effort and potential business disruption associated with conversion to a new clearing firm may discourage correspondents from switching service providers  consolidation among clearing service providers has led to forced conversions 
these conversions result in opportunities for correspondents to seek competing offers and  therefore  for service providers to solicit new correspondents business without having to overcome the difficulties of moving from an incumbent 
demand for increased reporting capabilities and integrated technology solutions 
clients are increasingly demanding products that seamlessly integrate front  middle and back office systems and allow for near real time updating of account status and margin balances 
opportunities in canadian  european and asian markets 
the canadian and european securities and investments industries have followed many of the same trends as the us market 
in addition  clearing firms in these markets are less likely to own trading applications  creating opportunities for the sale of nexa s products 
we opened our first asian office in hong kong in the first quarter of we generated net revenues in from our asian operations of approximately  and expect to expand our asian operations in our asian operations will initially be limited to marketing our technology products 
our differentiated product offerings we provide integrated execution  clearing  settlement and technology solutions to the global securities  futures and investment industry 
our solutions support trading in multiple markets  multiple investment products and multiple currencies 
our correspondents outsource these activities to us in order to avoid holding the capital required by regulatory authorities to support these activities as well as to reduce the need for specialized margin lending and clearing technology and support personnel 
we believe that our products and services provide the following benefits to our correspondents variable clearing costs and economies of scale 
we offer clearing services to our correspondents on a variable cost structure based on transaction volume 
we believe that our pricing structure allows our correspondents to take advantage of economies of scale by leveraging our investment in technology  software and systems at a significantly lower cost than these correspondents would generally incur to self clear 
the ability to obtain securities and futures clearing services on a cost effective basis is a key factor in enabling direct access and online broker dealers to charge their customers lower commissions than those charged by traditional broker dealers 
trading support in multiple markets and currencies 
we offer multi lingual  multi currency international products 
we believe that our global service offering provides our correspondents with the ability to operate efficiently across multiple markets  asset classes and currencies 
our global service offerings allow us to provide a single statement showing customer trades in multiple international markets 
enhanced account portfolio information services 
we have created customized software solutions to enable our correspondents to manage and analyze their accounts  which assists them in improving service levels to their customers while lowering fixed costs 
we offer private label and custom development capability to meet the branding needs of our correspondent and other institutional clients 
technology and clearing integration 
our solutions provide an integration of front  middle and back office systems and allow near real time updating of account status and margin balances  providing better service to investors and better risk management to the correspondent 
facilitation of compliance with governmental regulation 
by outsourcing regulated activities  such as margin lending  our correspondents are able to minimize reporting requirements and reduce the burden on management of dealing with related compliance issues 
in addition  we can facilitate broker dealer 
table of contents compliance with other regulatory requirements by providing automated reporting  record keeping and other tasks 
margin lending availability 
we make margin loans directly to the customers of our correspondent broker dealers 
as a result  our correspondents can compete more effectively in attracting their customers by earning interest income relating to margin loans without having to satisfy related capital requirements in april of  we were one of only two brokers approved by the nasd to offer portfolio margining at that time the nasd is now subsumed within the financial industry regulatory authority finra 
portfolio margining allows us to extend margin lending to qualified customers in excess of what is permitted under regulation t 
regulation t is the federal reserve board regulation that governs the amount of credit that brokerage firms and dealers may extend to their customers for the purchase of securities 
regulation t allows a trader to borrow of the purchase price of securities that can be purchased on margin 
portfolio margining allows us to extend margin lending to cover a greater percentage of the purchase price of securities based upon a risk calculation model approved by finra 
as of december  we have approved six correspondents for portfolio margining and have opened approximately portfolio margining accounts with balances of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange trading availability 
in  we began to act as a dealer for currency foreign exchange trades with certain institutional clients and other parties  offer quotes in certain modeled currencies and clear foreign currency trades through certain exchanges and ecns 
we also offer a third party bank s foreign exchange trading program to certain of our retail clients 
our competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to grow our business and increase our profitability over time fully integrated securities and futures processing and technology solutions 
we are a leading provider of infrastructure services to financial intermediaries offering a fully integrated solution across major securities and futures processing needs 
we believe our ability to integrate our technology offerings into all of our products and services is a significant factor in the successful expansion of our client base and the increase of our revenue from existing clients 
our products and services support trading in multiple markets  multiple investment products and multiple currencies  with integrated execution  clearing and settlement solutions 
it is our belief that  while some clients are willing to obtain these products from multiple vendors  most will determine that it is easier to obtain solutions with lower integration costs and risks from one provider that can also address the regulated securities and futures aspects of their business 
in addition  nexa provides real time and historical trading and brokerage management tools which complement our clearing services 
flexible services and infrastructure 
we provide a broad offering of infrastructure and technology products and services to our clients  available both on an unbundled basis and as a fully integrated solution 
our clients may choose to host these products on their own computer infrastructure or select that we host them 
in addition  clients may either incorporate nexa s brand name or provide these products and services to their customers on a private label basis 
we work closely with each of our clients to provide the set of products and services appropriate for their individual needs 
established market position as an independent provider of correspondent clearing services 
since our establishment in  we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become a leading provider of securities clearing services to approximately active correspondents in the us  canadian and us markets and futures clearing services to correspondents 
unlike most other major clearing providers  we are not affiliated with a larger financial institution 
as an independent clearing and technology solutions provider  we generally do not compete with our clients in other lines of business 
our independence is a key selling point when soliciting new business 
highly attractive and diversified client base 
our client base is comprised of online  direct access and traditional retail broker dealers  banks  hedge funds  fcms and other futures traders  algorithmic traders and securities exchanges and is internationally diversified through our operations in canada  the uk and asia 

table of contents for the year ended december   net revenues from clearing and commissions  including related net interest revenues  accounted for approximately of net revenues 
the following percentages are approximates 
direct market access broker dealers accounted for of these revenues and represented of our total correspondents  traditional retail broker dealers accounted for of these revenues and represented of our total correspondents  online broker dealers accounted for of these revenues and represented of our total correspondents and institutional clients accounted for of these revenues and of our total correspondents 
we have more recently expanded our market to include large banks  hedge funds  fcms and other futures traders  algorithmic traders and securities exchanges which comprised the balance of our revenues and correspondents 
scalable  recurring revenue business model 
our business benefits from a scalable operating platform 
our existing infrastructure is capable of processing significant additional volumes with limited incremental increases in our fixed costs 
we receive a recurring stream of revenues based on volumes from each of our correspondents with a low marginal cost of sales 
in addition  a significant portion of our technology revenues are based on asp arrangements with clients  linked to transactions and users 
proven and highly motivated management team 
with an average of over years of industry experience and holding a substantial equity interest in penson  our three member executive committee has the proven ability to manage our business through all stages of the business cycle 
roger j 
engemoen  jr  daniel p 
son  and philip a 
pendergraft  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  respectively  founded our business in and have built it to its current position 
this senior management group continues to own a significant portion of our company 
our growth strategies our goal is to be the leading independent provider of securities and futures processing infrastructure to the securities  futures and investment industry in the major global markets 
to accomplish this goal  we are pursuing the following key strategies capitalize on industry trends 
we believe we are positioned to benefit from several broad industry trends internationalization 
cross border functionality is becoming increasingly important to attracting correspondents 
with operations in four countries and the ability to provide access to markets as well as clearing and settlement services covering multiple depositories around the world in multiple currencies  we can provide this high value service to our clients 
consolidation 
typically  high conversion costs are a significant obstacle which must be overcome by a clearing firm which seeks to attract business from correspondents who are currently clients of another clearing firm 
however  consolidation among clearing service providers has led to many forced conversions 
as an independent provider and technology leader  we are well positioned to attract new clients faced with conversion decisions due to industry consolidation 
trading in multiple products 
clients increasingly seek to trade in multiple products on the same computer terminal  including equities  options and futures 
our products and services provide this capability and we believe this trend provides us with a significant opportunity to grow our business 
outsourcing 
the high cost of self clearing and increased regulatory scrutiny on securities and futures firms have driven many broker dealers to outsource their clearing responsibilities and technology needs 
even some larger firms are finding it more efficient to outsource such services 
we believe this trend will continue 
enhance revenue potential of each client relationship 
we offer a variety of products and solutions to broker dealers and securities firms  which together form an end to end solution 
as a result  we intend to grow in part by selling additional products to our existing clients 
some of nexa s clients are not currently clearing clients of penson 
we believe we have a significant opportunity to offer the full spectrum of clearing and execution services to many of nexa s clients  as well as offering technology services to our clearing and execution clients 

table of contents expand offering of portfolio margining 
during  we approved six of our correspondents for portfolio margining and opened approximately portfolio margining accounts with balances of approximately million 
we have experienced an increase in trading volume as a result of our introduction of portfolio margin accounts and expect to continue that trend in leverage existing platform to expand our product set and client base 
due to our significant investments in technology  we believe our infrastructure provides a leading fully integrated securities clearing and technology package to our core market 
this infrastructure facilitates clearing across several security types  including options and futures  and additional products can be offered and new clients added with minimal marginal cost 
using this infrastructure  we intend to expand our client base by focusing on the high volume direct access  online broker dealers and the futures trading industry 
we will continue to target our clearing services to the growing futures trading  direct access and online broker dealer markets and on margin lending as a core complementary service 
by promoting our integrated suite of solutions  we believe our clearing and margin lending activities will increase as our market share grows while the size of the direct access and online brokerage industry increases 
further expanding our client base in the institutional and retail brokerage markets 
as the brokerage industry has added a broader array of products and services and the operating margins in the industry have diminished  the profitability of the infrastructure services offered by many traditional institutional and retail brokers is under pressure 
we believe this trend will favor our business model of cost effectively providing dedicated infrastructure solutions to the broader brokerage community 
accordingly  we are expanding our focus on the traditional institutional and retail brokerage industry 
many institutional and retail brokers in the us have outsourced their clearing functions  and we believe this trend is now increasing internationally  which creates opportunities for us on a global basis 
we are also targeting these firms for our technology products and services 
expanding our client base in the algorithmic trading and hedge fund sectors 
our technology products enable us to increasingly market our services to algorithmic traders and hedge funds 
these sectors are among the most significant drivers of growth in the overall securities markets and we intend to increase our focus on these clients 
expanding our operations internationally 
we previously acquired a london based clearing company with experience in agency clearing operations in european securities markets and a canadian clearing company that provides clearing services to the direct access  on line discount and traditional retail markets in canada 
in the first quarter of we opened our first asian office in hong kong 
we have used these platforms to increase significantly our international capabilities to clear securities transactions and market our technology products 
we believe our ability to service clients throughout the north american and european securities markets will become more important as investors increasingly trade on a global basis  and we intend to expand our offering of technology products in the asian markets in fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  we intend to expand our margin lending business internationally 
expanding our futures business 
we believe that our purchase of ghco in february  was a significant step in expanding our futures clearing operations and our purchase of fcg in november  now gives us the ability to expand our futures offering to clients that need risk management and other services 
pursue accretive acquisitions 
through our past acquisitions  we have grown internationally  expanded our product base and added additional correspondents 
we intend to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions that will expand our technology product offerings  our clearing service capabilities and our client base

further  our solution allows a customer to download brokerage account information into quicken  a personal financial management software program  and other financial and spreadsheet applications so that all financial data can be integrated 
holding and safeguarding securities and cash deposits we hold and safeguard securities and cash deposits of our correspondents customers  which requires us to take legal responsibility for those assets 
many of our correspondents do not have the ability to hold securities and cash deposits due to regulatory requirements that require that the holder must comply with the net capital rules of the securities and exchange commission and other regulators with respect to these activities 
securities lending and borrowing we lend securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other broker dealers as a means of financing our business and facilitating transactions 
we also engage in conduit activities where we borrow securities from one broker dealer and lend the same securities to another broker dealer 
this lending is permitted under and governed by sec rules 
see business government regulation regulation of securities lending and borrowing 
all of our securities borrowing and lending activities are performed under a standard form of securities lending agreement  which governs each party s rights to mark securities to market 
proprietary trading certain of our subsidiaries engage in limited forms of proprietary trading 
this trading includes computerized trading and non automated trading strategies involving taking short term proprietary positions in equities  fixed income and other securities  derivatives and foreign currencies 
in general  these strategies involve relatively short term exposure to the markets and are usually undertaken in conjunction with hedging strategies and the use of derivatives contracts designed to mitigate the risk associated with these proprietary positions 
these activities are insignificant to revenues and pretax income 
futures products in addition to the futures clearing services provided by penson ghco  our newly acquired fcg subsidiary provides retail  risk management and consultation services for certain of our futures clients 

table of contents technology and data products an important component of our business strategy is to identify and to deploy technologies relevant to our target markets 
the technology embedded in our securities and futures processing infrastructure has enhanced our capacity to handle an increasing volume of transactions without a corresponding increase in personnel 
we use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties to provide customized  detailed account information to our clients 
during  we worked with our third party software vendors to improve processes  which enabled us to handle the dramatic increase in trade volume generated by our correspondents 
additionally  our technology is critical to our vision of providing a flexible and comprehensive offering of products and services to our clients 
our technology and data product offerings include customizable front end trading platforms  a comprehensive database of historic us and international equities  options and futures trade data  and order management services 
our approach to the development and acquisition of technology has allowed us to create an evolving suite of products that provides specific solutions to meet our clients individual requirements 
through our recently acquired fcg subsidiary  we also provide risk management and consultation services to our futures customers 
nexa provides our clients with innovative trading management technology with a global perspective 
nexa specializes in direct access trading technology and provides complete online brokerage solutions  including direct access trading applications  browser based trading interface  back office order management systems  market data feeds  historical data  and execution technology services  generally on a license fee basis 
nexa s fastpath product provides a full suite of financial information exchange fix gateway solutions for clients who require global connectivity  high throughput and reliability 
fix execution solutions allow clients to automatically transmit  receive or cancel advanced order types  execution reports  order status  positions  liquidity flags and account balances 
clients can connect using their own front end or back office applications or utilize applications available from nexa 
we generally provide our solutions to our clients on a private labeled basis to emphasize the client s branding 
nexa s products  such as omni pro  axis pro  and meridian  are designed to accommodate various market segments by providing different trading platforms and functionality to users 
all of our front end products benefit from several important features such as the ability to trade equities  options and futures and to have unified risk management for trading across multiple asset classes 
although there is a significant market for front end trading platforms that is independent of the market for clearing services  we have found that our ability to integrate our technology related products with our clearing services provides clients with a compelling reason to use penson for their clearing needs 
we believe this broader  integrated offering is a significant factor in our conversion of client prospects into actual clients 
our technology revenues generally include revenues from software development and customization of products and features  but our technology products are designed to generate substantial subscription based revenue over time 
our technology revenues have increased over the last year from million of revenue in to million of revenue in institutional and active retail front end trading software nexa has developed and is continuing to expand various front end trading software products 
we offer several products that are oriented towards different market segments 
omni pro is a level ii trading platform oriented to professional traders and provides broker dealer administrative modules 
level ii software enables the trader  among other things  to view prices for the same security across various markets and to select the desired market for order execution 
axis pro is a multi currency level ii trading platform focused on active retail traders 
meridian is a level i trading platform for less intensive applications for the active retail trader 
both axis pro and meridian are offered with broker dealer administrative modules  which allow broker dealers to monitor customer buying power and other regulatory compliance tasks  and to provide a repository for customer information 
all of our front end products benefit from a number of compelling features such as the ability to trade equities  options and futures and have unified risk management for trading across equities  options and futures 
many of our clearing competitors do not have similar systems that effect trades in all such instruments with similar risk 
table of contents mitigation capabilities 
there is a dynamic market for front end trading platforms that is independent of the market for our clearing services 
however  we are finding that our ability to offer these products provides our clients with a compelling reason to use our clearing and other products and services and is increasingly important in our conversion of client prospects into actual clients 
global execution hub nexa has built significant proprietary software and licensed certain software and telecommunications services to enable our clients to use our technology infrastructure to send orders for securities to all major north american exchanges  ecns and market destinations 
we have extended this network to include numerous international destinations such as the london stock exchange  uk market makers and others 
our clients can choose to use our execution infrastructure  independent of our other services  or to opt for a bundled solution combining technology products together with clearing and settlement 
this allows us to access a differentiated market segment for clients that clear with another firm or are self clearing  but which do not have a similar infrastructure capability 
in particular  because our network has been designed to maximize speed of execution  our offerings are very attractive to algorithmic traders for whom speed is essential to successful implementation of their trading strategies 
our infrastructure required significant time and investment to build and very few of our clearing competitors offer anything that is directly comparable 
global data products we believe it is critical to provide our clients with global trade data solutions 
nexa provides research quality  historical intraday time series data plus real time data feeds for the commodity and equity markets 
our suite of data products was significantly enhanced by our acquisition of the tick data assets in january its database of historical intraday equities  options and futures data consists of numerous futures symbols from exchanges in north america  europe  and asia 
the data is presented tick by tick and is delivered in a compressed  proprietary format 
the database of historical cash index data contains the most widely followed equity indices 
nexa also offers tickstream  a fully customized  low latency  real time market data feed 
data is delivered through a simple to use application program interface api and powered by advanced ticker plants that have multiple direct connections to global exchanges 
while these products do not currently generate material revenues  we provide data to over  clients  which we believe provides significant opportunities for cross selling our other products and services 
nexa has also built its own data ticker plant to access data from most us and many foreign exchanges and market centers 
we have also licensed certain foreign data from other sources 
the result is a very comprehensive offering of real time  delayed and historical data that we can market to our clients 
as with the international execution hub  our clients can use our data solutions together with or independent of our other products and services 
this enables us to compete with major securities data providers to offer comprehensive data solutions 
furthermore  our historical data offerings are not offered by most data services providers or clearing firm competitors and enable us to serve new client segments such as algorithmic traders and hedge funds to which we have had relatively less historical exposure through our clearing operations 
key licensed technology and proprietary customization we license a software program called phase from sungard 
phase is an online  real time data processing system for securities transactions 
phase performs the core settlement functions with industry clearing and depositary organizations 
during  we worked with our third party software vendors to improve processes  which enabled us to handle the dramatic increase in trade volume generated by our correspondents 
we have built a significant amount of proprietary software around phase which allows us to customize phase to meet each of our client s unique needs 
this customization increases the reliability and efficiency of our data processing model and permits us to process trades more quickly than if we relied on phase alone 
this customization also offers our clients more flexible access to information regarding their accounts  including the ability to see critical information in real time on a continuously updated basis  
table of contents manage their buying power across different accounts containing diverse instruments such as equities  options and futures  and  receive highly customized reports relating to their activity 
the above noted products are principally used by our us securities clearing subsidiary but  in many cases  enable our non us customers  both through our non us affiliates and directly  to access leading edge products and services when trading in the us markets 
we offer software that we have licensed from rolfe nolan  which we believe offers an increased variety of settlement and clearing applications  to certain of our canadian correspondents who trade futures products 
sales and marketing we focus our sales and marketing efforts in the us primarily on the direct access and online sectors 
increasingly  we have begun focusing our efforts on the algorithmic trading and hedge fund sectors of the global securities and investment industry 
we have also begun to more aggressively market execution only services to the global financial services market 
in addition  we believe that a significant opportunity exists in foreign markets as the adoption of online trading expands in other countries 
we have capitalized on this opportunity by implementing cross border and multi currency trade processing capabilities 
following the completion of our ipo in may  we increased our sales and marketing staff to take advantage of the additional financial resources which allowed us to expand our correspondent base 
we are also beginning to focus our marketing efforts in asia 
we participate in industry conferences and trade shows and seek to differentiate our company from our competitors based on our reputation as an independent provider of a technology focused integrated execution  clearing and settlement solution and based on our ability to support trading in multiple markets  multiple investment products and multiple currencies 
we generally enter into standard clearing agreements with our securities correspondents for an initial term of two or three years  during which we provide clearing services based on a schedule of fees determined by the nature of the financial instrument traded and the volume of the securities cleared 
in some cases our standard contract will also include minimum monthly clearing charge requirements 
subsequent to the initial term these contracts typically allow the correspondent to cancel our services upon providing us with days written notice 
futures clearing contracts between us and our correspondents are generally terminable on days notice 
futures clearing contracts directly between us and our customers are generally terminable at will 
as of december   we had approximately active securities clearing correspondents 
of these correspondents  are located in the us  while our us and canadian clearing operations provide services for correspondents and correspondents  respectively 
we also had active futures clearing correspondents 
before conducting business with a correspondent  we review a variety of factors relating to the prospective correspondent  including the correspondent s experience in the securities industry  its financial condition and the personal backgrounds of the key principals of the firm 
we seek to establish relationships with correspondents whose management teams and operations we believe will be successful in the long term  so that we may benefit from increased clearing volume and margin lending activity as the businesses of our correspondents grow 
strategic acquisitions we have engaged in a number of acquisition transactions which have facilitated our ability to expand our client base and provide leading edge technology infrastructure as well as to open international markets  positioning us to pursue a strategy of combining our increasingly global securities offerings with enhanced technology offerings on a multi instrument  multi currency  international platform 
to date  none of our acquisitions have exceeded the defined significant subsidiary thresholds pursuant to section w of sec regulation s x 
in november   our subsidiary penson ghco acquired all of the assets of first capitol group  llc  an fcm and a leading provider of technology products and services to futures traders  and assigned the purchased membership interest to ghp effective immediately thereafter 
we closed the transaction in november  and paid approximately million in cash  subject to a reconciliation to reported actual net income  as defined in the purchase agreement and issued approximately  shares of stock to the previous owners of fcg 
in addition  
table of contents we have agreed to pay an annual earnout of stock and cash for the two year period following the actual net income reconciliation  based on average net income  subject to certain adjustments including cost of capital  for the acquired business 
in november  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the partnership interests of chicago based goldenberg hehmeyer and co 
ghco  a leading international futures clearing and execution firm 
we closed the transaction in february and paid million in cash and approximately  shares of stock to the previous owners of ghco 
the million payout excluded of the initial purchase price  which we held back as a short term indemnity against certain claims we may face related to the acquisition 
we paid the holdback amount in the third quarter of in addition  we agreed to pay additional consideration in the form of an earnout over the next two years  in an amount equal to of penson ghco s pre tax earnings  as defined pursuant to the purchase agreement executed with the previous owners of ghco 
we do not expect to make an earnout payment relating to the first year of the integrated penson ghco acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  we acquired the clearing business of schonfeld securities llc  a new york based securities firm 
we closed the transaction in november and in january  we issued approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  to the previous owners of schonfeld as partial consideration for the assets acquired 
in addition  we have agreed to pay an annual earnout of stock and cash over a four year period that commenced on june   based on net income  as defined pursuant to the purchase agreement  of the acquired business 
we successfully completed the conversion of the seven schonfeld correspondents in the second quarter of we are currently in active discussions with various parties regarding acquisitions and investments  but at this time no material potential transaction is probable 
competition the market for securities clearing and margin lending services is highly competitive 
we expect competition to continue and intensify in the future 
we encounter direct competition from firms that offer services to direct access and online brokers 
some of these competitors include goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  pershing llc  a member of bny securities group  national financial services llc  a fidelity investments company  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  bear  stearns co 
inc  mf global ltd 
formerly man financial and rj obrien associates llc 
we also encounter competition from other clearing firms that provide clearing and execution services to the securities industry 
most of our competitors are affiliated with large financial institutions 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our clearing and margin lending services are price  technology  financial strength  client service and breadth of services 
based on management s experience  we believe that we presently compete effectively with respect to most of these factors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors offer a wider range of services and products than we offer and have greater name recognition and more extensive client bases 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities  technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more attractive terms to clients 
recent advancements in computing and communications technology are substantially changing the means by which securities transactions are effected and processed  including more access online to a wide variety of services and information  and have created a demand for more sophisticated levels of client service 
the provision of these services may entail considerable cost without an offsetting increase in revenues 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or may consolidate to enhance their services and products 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and they may acquire significant market share 
additionally  large firms that currently perform their own clearing functions may decide to start marketing their clearing services to other firms 

table of contents in addition to companies that provide clearing services to our target markets  we are subject to the risk that one or more of our correspondents may elect to perform their clearing functions themselves 
the option to convert to self clearing operations may be attractive due to the fact that as the transaction volume of the correspondent increases  the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for self clearing may be eventually offset by the elimination of per transaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm 
additionally  performing their own clearing services allows self clearing firms to retain customer free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities 
in order to make a clearing arrangement with us more attractive to these high volume broker dealers  we may offer such firms transaction volume discounts or other incentives 
some of the securities clearing contracts between us and our correspondents permit a correspondent to terminate its contract following the giving of written notice  typically between days and six months 
futures clearing contracts between us and our correspondents are generally terminable on days notice 
futures clearing contracts directly between us and our customers are generally terminable at will 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe upon our proprietary rights 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
we have not incurred significant liabilities related to the use of our intellectual property in the past  however  we cannot assure you that claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or invalidity or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
government regulation the securities and financial services industries generally are subject to extensive regulation in the us and elsewhere 
as a matter of public policy  regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with  among other things  safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets  not with protecting the interests of creditors or the shareholders of regulated entities such as penson 
in the us  the securities and futures industry is subject to regulation under both federal and state laws 
at the federal level  the sec regulates the securities industry  while the cftc regulates the futures industry 
these federal agencies along with finra  nfa  the various stock and futures exchanges  and other self regulatory organizations sros  require strict compliance with their rules and regulations 
companies that operate in these industries are subject to regulation concerning many aspects of their business  including trade practices  capital structure  record retention  money laundering prevention  and the supervision of the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
failure to comply with any of these laws  rules or regulations could result in censure  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  the suspension or termination the operations of the company or the suspension or disqualification of our directors  officers or employees 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we and some of our officers and other employees have been subject to claims arising from the violation of such laws  rules and regulations 
as a registered broker dealer  pfsi is required by law to belong to the securities investor protection corporation sipc 
in the event of a member s insolvency  the sipc fund provides protection for customer accounts up to  per customer  with a limitation of  on claims for cash balances 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in the uk and canada that are involved in the securities and financial services industries and may expand our business into other countries in the future 
to expand our services internationally  we will have to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business 

table of contents the securities and financial services industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated 
the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to expand internationally 
due to its focus on technology products  penson asia is not subject to many of the same restrictions that apply to our uk and canada subsidiaries 
the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
additional regulation  changes in existing laws and rules  or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of securities firms 
regulation of clearing activities we provide clearing services in the us  canada and europe through our subsidiaries 
brokers that clear their own trades are subject to substantially more regulatory requirements than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical  technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of customers and broker dealers  could lead to censures  fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our clients  the customers of our clients and others 
due to our acquisition of ghco  we are now also subject to additional cftc  nfa and futures exchange regulations that we were not subject to before 
as a result  we now must comply with an increasing amount of regulatory requirements and face additional liabilities if we are not able to adjust to the new regulatory environment 
regulation of securities lending and borrowing we engage in securities lending and borrowing services with other broker dealers by lending the securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other broker dealers  by borrowing securities from other broker dealers to facilitate our customer transaction activity  or by borrowing securities from one broker dealer and lending the same securities to another broker dealer 
within the united states  these types of securities lending and borrowing arrangements are governed by the sec 
the following is what we believe to be a descriptive summary of some important sec rules that govern these types of activities  but it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the regulations that govern these types of activities 
our securities lending and borrowing activities are primarily transacted through our us broker dealer subsidiary  which is subject to the sec s net capital rule 
the net capital rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to ensure that broker dealers will have adequate resources  including a percentage of liquid assets  to fund expenses of a self or court supervised liquidation 
see business government regulation regulatory capital requirements 
while the net capital rule is designed to ensure that the broker dealer has adequate resources to pay liquidation expenses  the objective of the sec s customer protection rule is to ensure that investment property of the firm s customers will be available to be distributed in liquidation 
the customer protection rule operates to protect both customer funds and customer securities 
to protect customer securities  the customer protection rule requires that the broker dealers promptly obtain possession or control of customers fully paid securities free of any lien 
however  broker dealers may lend or borrow customers securities purchased on margin or customers fully paid securities  if the broker dealer provides collateral exceeding the market value of the securities it borrowed and makes certain other disclosures to the customer 
with respect to customer funds  the customer protection rule requires broker dealers to make deposits into an account held only for the benefit of customers reserve account based on its computation of the reserve formula 
the reserve formula requires that broker dealers compare the amount of funds it has received from customers or through the use of their securities credits to the amount of funds the firm has used to finance customer activities debits 
in this manner  the customer protection rule ensures that the broker dealer s securities lending and borrowing activities do not impact the amount of funds available to customers in the event of liquidation 
sec rules c and c under the exchange act the hypothecation rules set forth requirements relating to the borrowing or lending of customers securities 
the hypothecation rules prohibit us from borrowing or lending customers securities in situations where the securities of one customer will be held together with securities of another customer  without first obtaining the written consent of each customer  the securities of a customer will 
table of contents be held together with securities owned by a person or entity that is not a customer  or the securities of a customer will be subject to a lien for an amount in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all customers securities 
regulation t was issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve federal reserve pursuant to the exchange act in part to regulate the borrowing and lending of securities by brokers dealers 
although regulation t allows broker dealers to deposit cash in order to secure the borrowing of securities for the purpose of making deliveries of such securities in the case of short sales  failure to receive securities they are required to deliver  or other similar cases and lend securities for such purpose against such a deposit  it also includes provisions regarding the provision of collateral 
for example  under the provisions of regulation t  broker dealers are generally required to collect of the value of equity securities purchased in a margin account 
however  we may require the deposit of a higher percentage of the value of equity securities purchased on margin 
securities borrowed transactions are extensions of credit in that the securities lender generally receives cash collateral that exceeds the market value of the securities that were lent 
in the national securities markets improvements act of  the us congress amended section c of the exchange act to exempt certain broker dealers from the federal reserve s credit regulations 
recently  the sec and other sros have approved new rules permitting portfolio margining that have the effect of permitting increased margin on securities and other assets held in portfolio margin accounts relative to non portfolio accounts 
we began offering portfolio margining to our clients in the second quarter of and anticipate increasing our portfolio margining accounts in with respect to such securities borrowing and lending  regulation sho issued under the exchange act generally prohibits  among other things  a broker dealer from accepting a short sale order unless either the broker dealer has already borrowed the security  has entered into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the security or has reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with this requirement 
failure to maintain the required net capital  accurately compute the reserve formula or comply with regulation t  portfolio margining rules or regulation sho may subject us to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and  if not cured  could ultimately require our us broker dealer subsidiary s liquidation 
a change in the net capital rule  the customer protection rule  regulation t or the portfolio margining rules or the imposition of new rules could adversely impact our ability to engage in securities lending and borrowing 
regulation of internet activities our business  both directly and indirectly  relies on the internet and other electronic communications gateways 
we intend to expand our use of these gateways 
to date  the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints 
however  the governmental agencies within the us and elsewhere are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet 
accordingly  new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our correspondents abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 
regulatory capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member of finra  pfsi is subject to the sec s net capital rule 
the net capital rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker dealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
among deductions from net capital are adjustments  which are commonly called haircuts  which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of firm inventory prior to disposition 
failure to maintain the required net capital may subject us to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and  if not cured  could ultimately require our liquidation 
the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends  redemption of stock  the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder  employee or affiliate  if such payment would reduce our net capital below required levels 

table of contents the net capital rule also provides that the sec may restrict any capital withdrawal  including the withdrawal of equity capital  or unsecured loans or advances to stockholders  employees or affiliates  if such capital withdrawal  together with all other net capital withdrawals during a day period  exceeds of excess net capital and the sec concludes that the capital withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
in addition  the net capital rule provides that the total outstanding principal amount of a broker dealer s indebtedness under specified subordination agreements  the proceeds of which are included in its net capital  may not exceed of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all subordinated indebtedness included in net capital  par or stated value of capital stock  paid in capital in excess of par  retained earnings and other capital accounts for a period in excess of days 
a change in the net capital rule  the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit some of our operations that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from pfsi  which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock 
a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business 
our uk subsidiary is subject to a monthly capital adequacy requirement test that requires it to maintain stockholders equity and qualifying subordinated loans in excess of a varying amount 
the amount varies month to month depending on certain balances and risks assumed by the subsidiary which is usually approximately million 
if the subsidiary fails to maintain the required capital  it may be subject to a regulatory sanction which would likely be a fine 
however  in more extreme cases  it could involve suspension or revocation of its license with the fsa 
if any regulatory sanction was imposed  the subsidiary s reputation would be severely damaged 
further  if the license is suspended or revoked  we may be required to discontinue our uk operations  which could result in diminished revenues 
pfsc is a member of the ida  an approved participant with the montreal exchange  a participating organization of the toronto stock exchange and the tsx venture exchange and a member of various canadian alternative trading systems 
pfsc is subject to rules  including those of the ida  relating to the maintenance of capital 
the ida regulates the maintenance of capital by member broker dealers by requiring that broker dealers periodically calculate their risk adjusted capital  referred to as rac  in accordance with a prescribed formula which is intended to ensure that members will be in a position to meet their liabilities as they become due 
a member s rac is calculated by starting with its net allowable assets  which are assets that are conservatively valued with emphasis on liquidity  and excluding assets that cannot be disposed of in a short time frame or whose current realizable value is not readily known  net of all liabilities  and deducting the applicable minimum capital and margin requirements  adding tax recoveries  if any  and subtracting the member s securities concentration charge 
furthermore  the ida rules provide for an early warning system which is designed to provide advance warning of a member firm encountering financial difficulties 
various parameters based on prescribed calculations involving the firm s rac are designed to identify firms with capital adequacy problems 
if any of the parameters are violated  several sanctions or restrictions are imposed on the member firm 
these sanctions  which may include the early filing of a monthly financial report  a written explanation to the ida from the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  a description of the resolution  or an on site visit by an examiner  are designed to reduce further financial deterioration and prevent a subsequent capital deficiency 
failure of a member to maintain the required risk adjusted capital as calculated in accordance with applicable ida and montreal exchange requirements can result in further sanctions such as monetary penalties  suspension or other sanctions  including expulsion of the member 
our futures clearing business is subject to the capital and segregation rules of the cftc  nfa  and futures exchanges in the united states and the fsa and futures exchanges in the uk 
our acquisition of ghco and fcg substantially increased our exposure to these rules as well as the capital requirements of applicable exchanges and clearing houses of which we are a clearing member 
if we fail to maintain the required capital or violate the customer segregation rules  we may be subject to monetary fines and the suspension or revocation of our license to clear futures contracts and carry customer accounts 
any interruption in our ability to continue this business would impact our revenues and profitability 

table of contents margin risk management our margin lending activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility or changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
we attempt to minimize the risks inherent in our margin lending activities by retaining in our margin lending agreements the ability to adjust margin requirements as needed and by exercising a high degree of selectivity when accepting new correspondents 
when determining whether to accept a new correspondent  we evaluate  among other factors  the correspondent s experience in the industry  its financial condition and the background of the principals of the firm 
in addition  we have multiple layers of protection  including the balances in customers accounts  correspondents commissions on deposit  clearing deposits and equity in correspondent firms  in the event that a correspondent or one of its customers does not deliver payment for our services 
we also maintain a bad debt reserve 
our customer agreements and fully disclosed clearing agreements require industry arbitration in the event of a dispute 
arbitration is generally less expensive and more timely than dispute resolution through the court system 
although we attempt to minimize the risk associated with our margin lending activities  there is no assurance that the assumptions on which we base our decisions will be correct or that we are in a position to predict factors or events which will have an adverse impact on any individual customer or issuer  or the securities markets in general 
state and provincial regulation our subsidiary  pfsi  is a broker dealer authorized to conduct business in all states under applicable state securities regulations 
pfsc is authorized to conduct business in all major provinces and territories in canada 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were employed in clearing operations  in technology support and development  in sales and marketing and in finance and administration 
of our employees  are employed in the us  in the uk  in canada and in asia 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
our continued success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and should we be unable to recruit and retain the necessary personnel  the development  sale and performance of new or enhanced services would likely be delayed or prevented 
in addition  difficulties we encounter in attracting and retaining qualified personnel may result in higher than anticipated salaries  benefits and recruiting costs  which could adversely affect our business 
in connection with our acquisition of ghco  we added approximately new employees 
in connection with our acquisition of fcg  we added approximately new employees

risk factors many factors could have an effect on pwi s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic  environmental  political  industry  business and financial conditions 
the principal factors are described below 

table of contents risks related to our business and our industry we face substantial competition from other securities and commodities processing and infrastructure firms  which could harm our financial performance and reduce our market share 
the market for securities and futures processing infrastructure products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services to our market 
our competitors include goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  pershing llc  a member of bny securities group  national financial services llc  a fidelity investments company  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  bear  stearns co 
inc  mf global ltd 
formerly man financial and rj obrien associates llc 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we possess 
some of our competitors also offer a wider range of services and financial products than we do and have greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than ours 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than ours 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
if we fail to compete effectively  our market share could decrease and our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
increased competition has contributed to the decline in net clearing revenue per transaction that we have experienced in recent years and may continue to create downward pressure on our net clearing revenue per transaction 
in the past  we have responded to the decline in net clearing revenue by reducing our expenses  but if the decline continues  we may be unable to reduce our expenses at a comparable rate 
our failure to reduce expenses comparably would reduce our profit margins 
we depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our clearing revenues 
our ten largest current clients accounted for of our total net revenues at december   while no client accounted for more than of net revenues 
the loss of even a small number of these clients at any one time could cause our revenues to decline substantially 
our clearing contracts are generally fixed term contracts of two to three years  which allow the correspondent to cancel our services upon providing us with days of notice  in most cases after the expiration of the fixed term 
our clearing contracts with these correspondents can also terminate automatically if we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 
in past periods  we have experienced temporary declines in our revenues when large clients have switched to other service providers 
for example  a large us clearing correspondent terminated its relationship with us in december  while we expect that this loss will be offset by revenue from new and current correspondents  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
there can be no assurance that our largest clients will continue to use our products and services 
our clearing operations could expose us to legal liability for errors in performing clearing functions and improper activities of our correspondents 
any intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our clearing functions or any mishandling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our correspondents and their customers could lead to censures  fines or other sanctions by applicable authorities as well as actions in tort brought by parties who are financially harmed by those failures or mishandlings 
any litigation that arises as a result of our clearing operations could harm our reputation and cause us to incur substantial expenses associated with litigation and damage awards that could exceed our liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts 
in the normal course of business  we purchase and sell securities as both principal and agent 
if another party to the transaction fails to fulfill its contractual obligations  we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transaction 
in the past  clearing firms in the us have been held liable for failing to take action upon the receipt of customer complaints  failing to know about the suspicious activities of correspondents or their customers under circumstances where they should have known  and even aiding and abetting  or causing  the improper activities of their correspondents 
we cannot assure you that our procedures will be sufficient to properly monitor our correspondents or protect us from liability for the acts of our correspondents under current laws and regulations 
table of contents or that securities industry regulators will not enact more restrictive laws or regulations or change their interpretations of current laws and regulations 
if we fail to implement proper procedures or fail to adapt our existing procedures to new or more restrictive regulations  we may be subject to liability that could result in substantial costs to us and distract our management from our business 
sharp decreases in short term interest rates would negatively impact the profitability of our margin lending business 
the profitability of our margin lending activities depends to a great extent on the difference between interest income earned on margin loans and investments of customer cash and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances and borrowings 
while they are not linearly connected  if short term interest rates fall  we generally expect to receive a smaller gross interest spread  causing the profitability of our margin lending and other interest sensitive revenue sources to decline 
recent decreases in short term interest rates may contribute to a decrease in our profitability during the time when such lower rates continue to be in effect 
short term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  decreases in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the us  which generally lead to a decrease in the gross spread we earn 
this is most significant when the federal funds rate is on the lower end of its historical range  as it is today 
interest rates in canada and europe are also subject to fluctuations based on governmental policies and economic factors and these fluctuations could also affect the profitability of our margin lending operations in these markets 
our margin lending business subjects us to credit risks and if we are unable to liquidate an investor s securities when the margin collateral becomes insufficient  the profitability of our business may suffer 
we provide margin loans to investors  therefore  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit 
as of december  and  our receivables from customers and correspondents were billion and billion  respectively  which predominantly reflected margin loans 
our credit risks include the risk that the value of the collateral we hold could fall below the amount of an investor s indebtedness 
this risk is especially great when the market is rapidly declining 
agreements with margin account investors permit us to liquidate their securities with or without prior notice in the event that the amount of margin collateral becomes insufficient 
despite those agreements and our house policies with respect to margin  which may be more restrictive than is required under applicable laws and regulations  we may be unable to liquidate the customers securities for various reasons including the fact that the pledged securities may not be actively traded  there may be an undue concentration of securities pledged  or a stop order may be issued with regard to pledged securities 
in the us  our margin lending is subject to the margin rules of the board of governors of the federal reserve and finra  whose rules generally permit margin loans of up to of the value of the securities collateralizing the margin account loan at the time the loan is made  subject to requirements that the customer deposit additional securities or cash in its accounts so that the customers equity in the account is at least of the value of the securities in the account 
we are also subject to regulations in canada and the uk with regard to our margin lending activities in those markets 
in certain circumstances  we may provide a higher degree of margin leverage to our correspondents with respect to their proprietary trading businesses than otherwise permitted by the margin rules described above based on an exemption for correspondents that purchase a class of preferred stock of pfsi 
in addition  for our portfolio margining accounts  we are able to extend substantially more credit to approved customers pursuant to a risk formula adopted by the sec 
as a result  we may increase the risks otherwise associated with margin lending with respect to these correspondents and customer accounts 
some of our directors and officers and their affiliates have from time to time maintained brokerage accounts with us directly or indirectly through our correspondents  and we may extend margin credit to these individuals or entities through these accounts 

table of contents we rely  in part  on third parties to provide and support the software and systems we use to provide our services 
any interruption or cessation of service by these third parties could harm our business 
we have contracted with sungard data systems and ibm canada limited ibm canada to provide a major portion of the software and systems necessary for our execution and clearing services 
our current agreement with sungard has an expiration date of july  and can be terminated by sungard upon written notice in the event that we breach the agreement 
our current agreement with ibm canada has an expiration date of december  and can be terminated by ibm canada upon written notice in the event that we breach the agreement 
in the past  we have experienced processing delays  occasional hardware and software outages with sungard and ibm canada 
any major interruption in our ability to process our transactions through sungard or ibm canada would harm our relationships with our clients and impact our growth 
we also license many additional generally available software packages 
failures in any of these applications could also harm our business operations 
we rely on sungard  ibm canada and other third parties to enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis  and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
during  we worked with our third party software vendors to improve processes  which enabled us to handle the dramatic increase in trade volume generated by our correspondents 
if  in the future  enhancements or upgrades of third party software and systems cannot be integrated with our technologies or if the technologies on which we rely fail to respond to industry standards or technological changes  we may be required to redesign our proprietary systems 
software products may contain defects or errors  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
the inability of third parties to supply us with software or systems on a reliable  timely basis or to allocate sufficient capacity to meet our trading volume requirements could harm relationships with our clients and our ability to achieve our projected level of growth 
our products and services  and the products and services provided to us by third parties  may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties  and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs  distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 
although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties and typically incorporate indemnification provisions in any agreements where we license third party software  we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights 
if we infringe upon the rights of third parties through use of our proprietary software or software licensed to us by third parties  we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those or similar rights on commercially reasonable terms 
in either of these events  we would need to undertake substantial reengineering to continue offering our services and may not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 
see also business intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
if our clients account information is misappropriated  we may be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 
we employ what we believe to be a high degree of care in protecting our clients confidential information 
to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet  we rely on encryption and authentication technology 
if third parties penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our clients personal or account information  or we were to otherwise release any such confidential information without our clients permission  unintentionally or otherwise  we could be subject to liability arising from claims related to impersonation or similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  as well as suffer harm to our reputation 
while we periodically test the integrity and security of our systems  we cannot assure you that our efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our clients account information will be successful 
internet security concerns have been a barrier to the acceptance of online trading  and any well publicized compromise of security could hinder the growth of the online brokerage industry 
we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect clients transactions and account data 
we 
table of contents may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of network or internet security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 
our services depend on our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage significant databases  and to receive and process securities and futures orders through a variety of electronic media 
our principal computer equipment and software systems are maintained at various locations such as texas  chicago  new york  toronto  montreal and london 
our systems or any other systems in the trading process could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons  including computer viruses or undetected errors in our internal software programs or computer systems  our inability to rapidly monitor all intraday trading activity  our inability to effectively resolve any errors in our internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected  heavy stress placed on our systems during peak trading times  or power or telecommunications failure  fire  tornado or any other natural disaster 
the average daily trade volume generated by our correspondents increased dramatically from to we believe that the additional software we licensed and changes we made to our operating procedures allowed us to accommodate the increased volume 
while we continue to monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility  we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict future volume increases or volatility or that our systems will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation 
any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems  communications systems or any other systems in the clearing or trading processes could cause the customers of our clients to suffer delays in the execution of their trades 
these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and could subject us to claims and losses  including litigation claiming fraud or negligence  damage our reputation  increase our service costs  cause us to lose revenues or divert our technical resources 
if our operational systems and infrastructure fail to keep pace with our anticipated growth  we may experience operating inefficiencies  client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 
we have experienced significant growth in our client base  business activities and the number of our employees 
the growth of our business and expansion of our client base has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems  the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies 
while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict the timing or rate of this growth or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 
in addition  the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has increased 
we have implemented and continue to implement formal compliance procedures to respond to these changes and the impact of our growth 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to improve our systems for operations  financial controls  and communication and information management  to refine our compliance procedures and enhance our compliance oversight  and to recruit  train  manage and retain our employees 
our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems  financial systems and controls and office facilities 
in the absence of continued revenue growth  the costs associated with 
table of contents these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully 
if we fail to manage our growth  we may experience operating inefficiencies  dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 
if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients  our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 
the global securities and futures industry is characterized by increasingly complex infrastructures and products  new and changing business models and rapid technological changes 
our clients needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes 
for example  an increasing number of our clients are from market segments including hedge funds  algorithmic trades and direct access customers who demand increasingly sophisticated products 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to respond to our clients demands for new services  products and technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients 
our existing correspondents may choose to perform their own clearing services as their operations grow 
we market our clearing services to our existing correspondents on the strength of our ability to process transactions and perform related back office functions at a lower cost than the correspondents could perform these functions themselves 
as our correspondents operations grow  they often consider the option of performing clearing functions themselves  in a process referred to in the securities industry as self clearing 
as the transaction volume of a correspondent grows  the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for self clearing may be eventually offset by the elimination of per transaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm 
additionally  performing their own clearing services allows self clearing firms to retain their customers margin balances  free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities 
our ability to sell our services and grow our business could be significantly impaired if we lose the services of key personnel 
our business is highly dependent on a small number of key executive officers 
we have entered into compensation agreements with various personnel  but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of the key personnel or the inability to identify  hire  train and retain other qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 
competition for key personnel and other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the securities and futures processing infrastructure industry is intense  and there is no assurance that we would be able to recruit management personnel to replace these individuals in a timely manner  or at all  on acceptable terms 
we may face risks associated with potential future acquisitions that could reduce our profitability or hinder our ability to successfully expand our operations 
over the past few years  our business strategy has included engaging in significant acquisitions which have facilitated our ability to provide technology infrastructure and establish a presence in international markets 
we have completed four acquisitions since  including the acquisitions of ghco and fcg in  which significantly expanded our futures business 
in the future  we plan to acquire additional businesses or technologies as part of our growth strategy 
we are currently in active discussions with various parties  but at this time no potential transaction is probable 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions  which potentially involve the following risks diversion of management s time and attention to the negotiation of the acquisitions  difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses  technologies  operations and personnel including  but not limited to  the increased trade volume of acquired businesses  the need to modify financial and other systems and to add management resources  assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses  
table of contents unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations and disruption of our ongoing business  dilution to our existing stockholders due to the issuance of equity securities  possible adverse short term effects on our cash flows or operating results  and possible accounting charges due to impairment of goodwill or other purchased intangible assets 
failure to manage our acquisitions to avoid these risks could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions 
our credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
these covenants limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase our capital stock or make other restricted payments  make investments  and sell certain assets 
in  we deemed it to be in the best interests of our stockholders to commence a stock repurchase program  and obtained bank approval to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we have not determined that an additional stock repurchase program would be advisable at this time  but if we were to do so  we cannot assure you that we will be able to gain all necessary approvals for any such program 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to meet those tests at all 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders under the credit facility accelerated the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay the credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 
our revenues may decrease due to declines in trading volume  market prices  liquidity of securities markets or proprietary trading activity 
we generate revenues primarily from transaction processing fees we earn from our clearing operations and interest income from our margin lending activities and interest earned by investing customers cash 
these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes  market prices and liquidity of securities markets 
over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility 
sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market values of securities can result in reduced trading activity  illiquid markets  declines in the market values of securities carried by our customers and correspondents  the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations  reduced margin loan balances of investors  and increases in claims and litigation 
the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our clearing operations and margin lending activities 
certain of our subsidiaries engage in proprietary trading activities 
please see our discussion in business securities processing proprietary trading 
historically these activities have accounted for a very small portion of our total revenues and net income 
with respect to most of such trading  we endeavor to limit our exposure to markets through  among other means  employing hedging strategies and by limiting the period of time for which we have exposure to markets 
however  we are not completely protected against market risk from such trading at any 
table of contents particular point in time and proprietary trading risks could adversely impact operating results in a specific financial period 
our significant non us operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our profitability 
we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations 
our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates 
as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us  fluctuations in currencies of other countries  especially the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar  may materially affect our operating results 
as we continue to expand our business operations globally  our exposure to fluctuations in currencies of other countries will continue to increase 
we do not typically use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in our consolidated financial statements  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  at a constant level of business  our reported international sales  earnings  assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and or translation risks effectively  or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk 
general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets  which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 
trading volume  market prices and liquidity are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
these factors include the availability of short term and long term funding and capital  the level and volatility of interest rates  legislative and regulatory changes  currency values and inflation  and national  state and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions 
these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets 
our largest source of revenues has historically been our revenues from clearing operations  which are largely driven by the volume of trading activities of the customers of our correspondents and proprietary trading by our correspondents 
our margin lending revenues and our technology revenues are also impacted by changes in the trading activities of our correspondents and clients 
accordingly  any significant reduction in activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the proportion of clearing operations revenues and interest income  our lengthy sales and integration cycle with new correspondents  the gain or loss of business from a correspondent  reductions in per transaction clearing fees  
table of contents changes in bad debt expense from margin lending as compared to historical levels  changes in the rates we charge for margin loans  changes in the rates we pay for cash deposits we hold on behalf of our correspondents and their customers and changes in the rates at which we can invest such cash deposits  changes in the market price of securities and our ability to manage related risks  fluctuations in overall market trading volume  the relative success and or failure of third party clearing competitors  many of which have increasingly larger resources than we have as a result of recent consolidation in our industry  the relative success and or failure of third party technology competitors including  without limitation  competitors to our nexa business  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and other expenses  and the amount and timing of capital expenditures 
our expense structure is based on historical expense levels and the expected levels of demand for our clearing  margin lending and other services 
if demand for our services declines  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in order to sustain our profitability 
due to the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our historical revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon such comparisons as indicators of future performance 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain the rates of revenue growth we have experienced in the past  improve our operating results or sustain our profitability on a quarterly basis 
our involvement in futures and options markets subjects us to risks inherent in conducting business in those markets 
we principally clear futures and options contracts on behalf of our correspondents  fcms and their respective customers 
trading in futures and options contracts is generally more highly leveraged than trading in other types of securities 
this additional leverage increases the risk associated with trading in futures and options contracts  which in turn raises the risk that a correspondent  introducing broker  or customer may not be able to fully repay its creditors  including us  if it experiences losses in its futures and options contract trading business 
we have recently acquired the partnership interests of ghco  and the limited liability company interests of fcg which will substantially increase our operations in the futures markets 
because of this increased activity  we will face more exposure to the risks associated with the clearing of futures contracts 
we may not be able to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
as a dealer for foreign exchange trades  we enter into currency transactions with certain of our institutional clients or other institutions using modeled prices that we determine and seek to hedge our risk by making similar transactions on the various exchanges or electronic communication networks of which we are a participant 
while we expect to be able to limit our risk in our transactions with our clients through hedging transactions on exchanges or ecns or through other counterparty relationships  there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into these transactions at prices similar to those which we entered into with our clients 
in addition  while we intend to enter into the hedging transactions after we enter into a transaction with our client or the relevant institution  it is possible that currency prices could fluctuate before we are able to enter into such hedging transactions 
the securities and futures businesses are highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 
our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades 
terrorist activities in september caused the us securities markets to close for four days 
this impacted our revenue and profitability for that period of time 
if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity  our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

table of contents risks related to government regulation all aspects of our business are subject to extensive government regulation 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may be subject to disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations  and our business may be harmed 
the securities industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
in addition to these laws  we must comply with rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission sec  the financial industry regulatory authority finra  the us commodity futures trading commission cftc  national futures association nfa  various stock and futures exchanges  state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets 
broker dealers and fcms are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities and futures businesses  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers and fcms  use and safekeeping of investors funds and securities  capital structure  margin lending  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of investor accounts 
our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of an effective compliance system as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed non compliance with these regulations in the future and even for the claimed non compliance of our correspondents with such regulations 
if a claim of non compliance is made by a regulatory authority  the efforts of our management could be diverted to responding to such a claim and we could be subject to a range of possible consequences  including the payment of fines and the suspension of one or more portions of our business 
additionally  our clearing contracts generally include automatic termination provisions which are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 
we and certain of our officers and employees have been subject to claims of non compliance in the past  and may be subject to claims and legal proceedings in the future 
we also operate clearing and related businesses in the uk and canada and execute transactions in global markets 
these non us businesses are also heavily regulated 
to the extent that different regulatory regimes impose inconsistent or iterative requirements on the conduct of our business  we will face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts 
in addition  as we expand into new non us markets with which we may have relatively less experience  there is a risk that our lack of familiarity with the regulations impacting such markets may affect our performance and results 
the regulatory environment in which we operate has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or reduce our profitability 
the legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo further change in the future 
the cftc  the sec  finra  nfa  various securities or futures exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations 
these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable 
changes in the 
table of contents interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business 
in addition  because our industry is heavily regulated  regulatory approval may be required prior to expansion of our business activities 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion 
even if approvals are obtained  they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 
if we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulations  we may be subject to fines  suspension  revocation of registration or expulsion by regulatory authorities 
we are subject to stringent rules imposed by the sec  finra  and various other regulatory agencies which require broker dealers to maintain specific levels of net capital 
net capital is the net worth of a broker dealer  less deductions  for other types of assets including assets not readily convertible into cash and specified percentages of a broker dealer s proprietary securities positions 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra  which  if not cured  could ultimately lead to our liquidation 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against our net capital  we might be required to limit or discontinue our clearing and margin lending operations that require the intensive use of capital 
in addition  our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries could be restricted  which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay debt at the parent company level and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if necessary 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could impede our ability to expand or even maintain our present volume of business 
our futures clearing business is subject to the capital and segregation rules of the nfa and cftc 
our recent acquisitions of ghco and fcg substantially increased our exposure to these rules 
if we fail to maintain the required capital  or if we violate the customer segregation rules  we may be subject to monetary fines  and the suspension or revocation of our license to clear futures contracts 
any interruption in our ability to continue this business would impact our revenues and profitability 
outside of the us  we are subject to other regulatory capital requirements 
our uk subsidiary is subject to capital adequacy rules that require our subsidiary to maintain stockholders equity and qualifying subordinated loans at specified minimum levels 
if we fail to maintain the required regulatory capital  we may be subject to fine  suspension or revocation of our license with the financial services authority 
if our license is suspended or revoked or if the capital adequacy requirements are changed or expanded  we may be required to discontinue our uk operations  which could result in diminished revenues 
as a member of the ida  an approved participant with the montreal exchange  a participating organization with the toronto stock exchange and a member of various canadian alternative trading systems  pfsc is subject to the rules and policies of the ida and other rules relating to the maintenance of regulatory capital 
specifically  to ensure that ida members will be able to meet liabilities as they become due  the ida requires its member broker dealers to periodically calculate their risk adjusted capital in accordance with a prescribed formula 
if pfsc fails to maintain the required risk adjusted capital  it may be subject to monetary sanctions  suspensions or other sanctions  including expulsion as a member 
if pfsc is sanctioned or expelled or if the risk adjusted capital requirements are changed or expanded  pfsc may be required to discontinue operations in canada  which could result in diminished revenues 
in addition  some of the investments we make in our business may impact our regulatory capital 
we have made large investments into nexa and expect to continue to do so in the future 
investments in non regulated subsidiaries and increases in illiquid assets  including unsecured customer accounts  have a negative impact on the capital available for our regulated subsidiaries 
if we experience increased levels of unsecured and partially secured accounts in the future  our financial results may be harmed 
procedures and requirements of the usa patriot act may expose us to significant costs or penalties 
as participants in the financial services industry  our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations  including the usa patriot act of  which require that they know certain information about their customers and 
table of contents monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities 
the cost of complying with the patriot act and related laws and regulations is significant 
we may face particular difficulties in identifying our international customers  gathering the required information about them and monitoring their activities 
we face risks that our policies  procedures  technology and personnel directed toward complying with the patriot act are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties due to noncompliance 
such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks related to our corporate structure our discontinued operations expose us to legal and other risks 
although the split off transaction described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations split off transaction  has occurred  we may incur future liabilities related to the operations of the samco entities 
due to the company s indirect ownership of the samco entities prior to our ipo we may be exposed to additional liabilities beyond what we may ordinarily encounter in our typical customer relationships

these provisions include a classified board of directors  limitations on the removal of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  and the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings 
in addition  our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to institute a rights plan  or a poison pill  that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors

table of contents financial overview net revenues revenues we generate revenues from most clients in several different categories 
clients generating revenues for us from clearing transactions almost always also generate significant interest income from related balances 
revenues from clearing transactions are driven largely by the volume of trading activities of the customers of our correspondents and proprietary trading by our correspondents 
our average clearing revenue per trade is a function of numerous pricing elements that vary based on individual correspondent volumes  customer mix  and the level of margin debit balances and credit balances 
our clearing revenue fluctuates as a result of these factors as well as changes in trading volume 
we focus on maintaining the profitability of our overall correspondent relationships  including the clearing revenue from trades and net interest from related customer margin balances  and by reducing associated variable costs 
we collect the fees for our services directly from customer accounts when trades are processed 
we only remit commissions charged by our correspondents to them after deducting our charges 
for this reason  we have no significant receivables to collect 
our largest source of revenue is interest income 
we often refer to our interest income as interest  gross to distinguish this category of revenue from interest  net that is generally used in our industry 
interest  gross is generated by charges to customers or correspondents on margin balances and interest earned by investing customers cash  and therefore these revenues fluctuate based on the volume of our total margin loans outstanding  the volume of the cash balances we hold for our correspondents customers  the rates of interest we can competitively charge on margin loans and the rates at which we can invest such balances 
we also earn interest from our stock borrowing and lending activities 
technology revenues are a growing part of our business and consist of both development and transactional revenues generated by nexa 
a significant portion of these revenues are collected directly from clearing customers along with other charges for clearing services as described above 
most development revenues and some transaction revenues are collected directly from clients and are reflected as receivables until they are collected 
other revenues include charges assessed directly to customers for certain transactions or types of accounts and profits from proprietary trading activities  including foreign exchange transactions and fees charged to our correspondents customers 
our clearing brokers in the us  canada and the us each generate these types of transactions 
interest expense from securities operations our largest source of expense is interest expense incurred in our daily operations in connection with interest we pay on credit balances we hold and on short term borrowings we make to fund activities of our correspondents and their customers 
we have two primary sources of borrowing commercial banks and stock lending institutions 
regulations differ by country as to how operational needs can be funded  but we often find that stock loans which are secured with customer or correspondent securities as collateral can be obtained at a lower rate of interest than loans from commercial banks 
operationally  we review cash requirements each day and borrow the requirements from the most cost effective source 
interest expense on long term debt is shown below operating income and relates to our long term capital debt 
revenues from clearing and commission fees represented  and of our total net revenues in  and respectively 
net interest income represented  and of our total net revenues in those same years 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses results of operations 

table of contents expenses employee compensation and benefits our second largest category of expense is the compensation and benefits that we pay to our employees  which includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs 
these costs vary by country according to the local prevailing wage standards 
we utilize technology whenever practical to limit the number of employees and thus keep costs competitive 
in the us  most of our employees are located in cities where employee costs are lower than where our largest competitors primarily operate 
a portion of total employee compensation is paid in the form of bonuses and performance based compensation 
as a result  depending on the performance of particular business units and the overall company performance  total employee compensation and benefits could vary materially from period to period 
other operating expenses expenses incurred to process trades include floor brokerage and exchange and clearance fees  and those expenses tend to vary significantly with the level of trading activity 
the related communications and data processing costs do not vary directly with the level of trading activity 
occupancy and equipment expenses include lease expenses for office space  computers and other equipment that we require to operate our businesses 
other expenses include legal  regulatory and accounting expenses along with travel and miscellaneous expenses 
as a public company  we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  which may require us to incur significant expenditures in the near term to document  review and test our existing systems of internal controls in accordance with this act 
this could require us to hire and train additional personnel to comply with these requirements 
in addition  as a public company  we expect to incur additional costs for external advisers such as legal  accounting  auditing and investor relations services

employee compensation and benefits total employee costs increased million  or  to million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the primary reasons for this increase were a increase in headcount from as of december  to as of december  the increase occurred primarily in our us and canadian clearing operations due to the continued expansion of the variety of our services and the number of correspondents served in those markets

table of contents net income as a result of the foregoing  net income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources operating liquidity our clearing broker dealer subsidiaries typically finance their operating liquidity needs through secured bank lines of credit and through secured borrowings from stock lending counterparties in the securities business  which we refer to as stock loans 
most of our borrowings are driven by the activities of our clients or correspondents  primarily the purchase of securities on margin by those parties 
as of december   we had nine uncommitted lines of credit with eight financial institutions for the purpose of facilitating our clearing business as well as the activities of our customers and correspondents 
seven of these lines of credit permitted us to borrow up to an aggregate of approximately million while two lines had no stated limits 
as of december   we had approximately million in short term bank loans outstanding which left approximately million available under such lines of credit 
as noted above  our businesses that are clearing brokers also have the ability to borrow through stock loan arrangements 
there are no specific limitations on our borrowing capacities pursuant to our stock loan arrangements 
borrowings under these arrangements bear interest at variable rates  are secured primarily by our firm inventory or customers margin account securities  and are repayable on demand 
at december   we currently have approximately million in borrowings under stock loan arrangements 
as a result of our customers and correspondents aforementioned activities  our operating cash flows may vary from year to year 
capital resources pwi provides capital to all of our subsidiaries 
pwi has the ability to obtain capital through equipment leases and through a million line of credit 
while equipment purchased under capital leases is typically secured by the equipment itself  pwi s line of credit is not secured 
as of december   the company had million outstanding on this line of credit 
the company also has the ability to obtain liquidity via follow on offerings in the public equity markets 
net proceeds from our may ipo were approximately million 
after providing for the capital contribution of million made to samco in accordance with the split off agreement  we used the balance of the net proceeds from this offering to repay debt  including approximately million of long term indebtedness under a bank term loan  and a million short term promissory note 
the remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under several short term loans from our existing uncommitted bank lines of credit or under stock loans  which we use for the daily working capital needs of our subsidiaries 
prior to our successful ipo  we had historically financed our capital needs through the use of cash generated by operations  and small private placements of equity with our shareholders 
in  we borrowed million from a number of private parties on a convertible note  which was converted to equity effective june  in  we raised million  less related expenses of million from tcv v  lp and tcv member fund  lp  funds managed by technology crossover ventures  a venture capital firm  in exchange for our preferred stock

we raised approximately million after expenses in our initial public offering of our common stock  which closed in the second quarter we plan to finance our future operating liquidity needs with loans from banks and stock lending counterparties 
we plan to finance our future capital needs with operating earnings and bank debt 
as a holding company  we access the earnings of our operating subsidiaries through the receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of securities regulators in their respective countries relating to liquidity and capital standards  which may serve to limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
our principal us broker dealer subsidiary  pfsi  is subject to the sec uniform net capital rule rule c  which requires the maintenance of a minimum net capital 
pfsi elected to use the alternative 
table of contents method  permitted by rule c  which requires pfsi to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equal to the greater of  or of aggregate debit balances  as defined in the sec s reserve requirement rule rule c 
at december   pfsi had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its required net capital of million 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments under long term debt and long term non cancelable lease agreements and have contingent commitments under a variety of commercial arrangements 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our commitments and contingencies 
there were no amounts outstanding under repurchase agreements at december  the table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   including our payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations and accrued interest capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the entire long term debt balance is a revolving credit facility which the company may pay down at any time  accordingly  only interest accrued at december has been included here 
during  our corporate building lease was extended until june under the terms of that lease  effective july   we leased approximately an additional  square feet  which increased our rent expense by an additional million a year 
in may  we repaid all long term debt obligations and accrued interest with the proceeds from our ipo and terminated our credit agreement 
we subsequently entered into a new three year credit facility for million 
as of december  the company has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to revenue recognition  software development and the valuation of stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from clearing transactions are recorded in the company s books and records on a trade date basis 
there are three major types of technology revenues completed products that are processing transactions every month generate revenues per transaction which are recognized on a trade date basis  these same completed products may also generate monthly terminal charges for the delivery of data or processing capability which are recognized in the month to which the charges apply  technology development services are recognized when the service is performed or under the terms of the technology development contract as described below 
interest and other revenues are recorded in the month that they are earned to date  our technology development contracts have not required significant production  modification or customization such that the service element of our overall relationship with the client does not meet the criteria for separate accounting under statement of position  software revenue recognition 
all of our products are fully functional when initially delivered to our clients  and any additional technology development work that is contracted for is as outlined below 
technology development contracts generally cover only additional work that is performed to modify existing products to meet the specific needs of individual customers 
this work can range from cosmetic modifications to the customer interface private labeling to custom development of additional features requested by the client 
technology revenues arising from development contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis based on outputs unless there are significant uncertainties preventing the use of this approach in which case a completed contract basis is used 
the company s revenue recognition policy is consistent with applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations  including sop and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
software development revenues and costs associated with software developed under contract for a customer face some of the same judgmental issues described above  but also involve an assessment of the profitability expected for a project that can extend over a considerable time period 
to date  our projects have included provisions for on going billings  which include charges relating to maintenance and infrastructure support  but there can be no guarantee that all future contracts will have such provisions 
in the absence of such provisions  judgments need to be made relating to how much revenue is required to be deferred to cover on going maintenance and other customer specific software development costs 
costs associated with software developed for internal use are capitalized based on sop and other related guidance 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of software that do not meet the capitalization criteria  such as costs of activities performed during the preliminary and post implementation stages  are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in development and enhancements that do not meet the criteria to capitalize are activities performed during the application development stage such as designing  coding  installing and testing 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we review any impairment of the capitalized costs on a periodic basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the past  we did not have material exposure to reductions in the targeted federal funds rate 
however  during there were significant decreases in these rates 
we encountered a basis point decrease in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter  resulting in an effective rate for the quarter of 
actual rates have fallen by another basis points as of march   to a current targeted federal funds rate of 
based upon the december quarter average balances  assuming no increase  and adjusting for the timing of these rate reductions  we believe that the decline to will reduce pretax income by approximately million 
we estimate that each of the next four basis points of reduction  if they occur  would reduce pre tax income by an additional million per quarter  assuming no changes in our december quarter average balances 
despite such interest rate changes  we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes or similar market risks 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risk 
in addition  we do not maintain material inventories of securities for sale  and therefore are not subject to equity price risk 
we extend margin credit and leverage to our correspondents and their customers  which is subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a proportional amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our correspondents customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  which can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we are indemnified and held harmless by our correspondents from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit  leverage and short sales of their customers 
however  if our correspondents do not have sufficient regulatory capital to cover such problems  we may be exposed to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers and their correspondents fail to satisfy their obligations 
our account level margin credit and leverage requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve  or similar regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions 
recently  the sec and other sros have approved new rules permitting portfolio margining that have the effect of permitting increased leverage on securities held in portfolio margin accounts relative to non portfolio accounts 
we began offering portfolio margining to our clients in we intend to continue to meet or exceed any account level margin credit and leverage requirements mandated by the sec  other sros  or similar regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions as we expand the offering of portfolio margining to our clients 
the profitability of our margin lending activities depends to a great extent on the difference between interest income earned on margin loans and investments of customer cash and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances and borrowings 
if short term interest rates fall  we generally expect to receive a smaller gross interest spread  causing the profitability of our margin lending and other interest sensitive revenue sources to decline 
short term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  decreases in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the us  which generally lead to a decrease in the gross spread we earn 
this is most significant when the federal funds rate is on the low end of its historical range 
interest rates in canada and europe are also subject to fluctuations based on governmental policies and economic factors and these fluctuations could also affect the profitability of our margin lending operations in these markets
