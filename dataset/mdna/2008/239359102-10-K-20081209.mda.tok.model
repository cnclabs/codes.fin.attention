overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depends  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past and continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
in the past few years  substantially all of our clients have been focused on the exploration for and production of natural gas 
our return to profitability in fiscal after several years of losses was directly related to an increase in the level of exploration for domestic oil and natural gas reserves by the petroleum industry since the increased level of exploration was a function of higher prices for oil and natural gas 
as a result of the increase in domestic exploration spending  we experienced an increased demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services during this period  particularly from entities seeking natural gas reserves 
since august the price of oil and natural gas has declined significantly and there has been a significant disruption in global credit markets 
as a result of these factors  during the third quarter of several of our clients reduced the size of or delayed seismic projects 
while the markets for oil and natural gas have been very volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we have continued to experience high demand for our services despite recent fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
however  a significant sustained drop in oil and natural gas prices or the inability of our clients to secure funding for new exploration projects would have a negative impact on demand for 
table of contents our services 
because substantially all of our current clients are focused on the exploration for and production of natural gas  a sustained significant decline in the price of natural gas in particular would have a negative effect on the demand for our services 
we continue to focus on increasing the revenues and profitability of our existing crews by upgrading our recording capacity  expanding the channel count on existing crews  adding to our energy source fleet and utilizing related technologies 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  or equipment failure 
consequently  our successful efforts to negotiate more favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
although our clients may cancel their supplemental service agreements with us on short notice  we believe we currently have a sufficient order book to sustain operations at full capacity into calendar on all sixteen crews 
fiscal highlights our financial performance for fiscal significantly improved when compared to our financial performance for fiscal as a result of the continuing strong demand for our seismic services due to high levels of exploration and development activities  particularly by entities seeking natural gas reserves 
as a result of continuing high demand  we repaid all  outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit in the fourth quarter  replaced an i o system ii mrx recording system on an existing crew with a  channel aram aries recording system  replaced an i o system ii mrx recording system on an existing crew with an  channel aram aries recording system  took delivery of thirty ion vibrator energy source units  added four ivi enviro mini vibrator energy source units used to operate in urban and sensitive environments 
the company now operates eight such units  increased channel count from  to in excess of  redeployed an existing i o system ii mrx recording system on an additional crew bringing the total of the company s operating data acquisition crews to sixteen  and operated in west texas  south texas  fort worth basin of texas  new mexico  oklahoma  arkansas  colorado  utah  montana  west virginia  pennsylvania  california  louisiana  nevada and new york 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services 
revenue growth in fiscal was primarily the result of the addition of new seismic data acquisition crews in september and may and the upgrading of recording systems on existing crews  along with increased channel counts and productivity on existing crews 
recorded in fiscal revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies  and dynamite energy sources  all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained level of these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  the rocky mountains  the fayetteville shale  and the arkoma basin 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the full year of service for the three acquisition crews deployed in fiscal and the additional crew placed into service in fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal while the ratio of general and administrative expenses to revenue declined in fiscal due to the increase in revenues  the actual dollar amount increased 
the increase of  from fiscal to fiscal reflects ongoing expenses necessary to support expanded field operations

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of changes in state tax rates as a result of the varying states in which we operate from year to year 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services 
revenue growth in fiscal was primarily due to the addition of three seismic data acquisition crews along with pricing and productivity improvements realized from the expanded capabilities of existing crews 
recorded in the fourth quarter revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies  and dynamite energy sources all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained increase in these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued geographic expansion in response to increased exploration activities in the appalachian basin  the rocky mountains  the fayetteville shale  and the arkoma basin 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the full year of service for the twelfth crew fielded in fiscal and the start up and ongoing expenses of the three acquisition crews deployed in fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs

liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal source of cash is amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  our capital expenditures 

table of contents cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect an increase in total revenues resulting from our expanded business and an increase in accounts receivable without a correlating increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable derives principally from an increase in our trade receivables 
this increase in trade receivables is consistent with the growth in our revenues during fiscal  and the number of days that sales remain on account is consistent with fiscal in addition  accounts receivable contains anticipated insurance proceeds for the equipment lost on march  see discussion of fire in item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the financial statements included in
