our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the factors listed in item a risk factors 

table of contents item a 
risk factors reliance on single product line 
our accelerated reader software and supplemental accelerated reader quizzes accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader and supplemental quizzes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in several states  including california  texas  florida  north carolina and georgia  which accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of our net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district or districts controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing our products and services  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators  and their other suppliers 
there can be no assurance that educational institutions and or individual educators will continue to invest in technology based products and professional development for reading and other curricula or continue to respond favorably to our marketing 
our inability to increase the number of products sold or number of schools served would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of our dependence on educational institutions  the funding of which is largely dependent on government support  a substantial decrease in government budgets or funding for educational software or technology would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic slow downs that negatively affect school funding can adversely impact the sale of our products and services to schools 
in addition  certain aspects of government sponsored education initiatives may not endorse  or be complementary to  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products and services  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on continued product development 
the educational technology and services markets in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions and sudden technological change 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including our ability to enhance our existing products  develop and successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion  and respond quickly and cost effectively to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  hardware platforms  programming languages  alternative delivery systems  the internet and other uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that new products will be as well received as our established products  particularly since they may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
we attempt to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of our products 
our adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete or that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain our competitive position 
acquisitions 
in order to strengthen our business  we continually evaluate strategic opportunities  including acquisitions 
acquisitions involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others the failure to integrate personnel  technology  research and development  marketing and sales operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  the potential loss of the acquired company s customers  as well as our own  and unanticipated costs and liabilities 
any integration process will require significant time and resources  and we may not be able to manage the process successfully 
if customers of the acquired company  or our customers  are uncertain about our ability to operate on a combined basis with the acquired company  they could delay or cancel orders for products and services 
moreover  we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction 
if we fail to integrate an acquired company or business successfully  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected  including the potential need to record a non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
reliance on statistical studies to demonstrate effectiveness of our products and services 
we rely on statistical studies to demonstrate that our products and related services improve student achievement 
we believe that these studies accurately reflect the performance of our products 
these studies  however  involve the following risks i the sample sizes used in our studies may yield results that are not representative of the general population of 
table of contents students who use our products  ii the methods used to gather the information upon which these studies are based depend on cooperation from students and other participants  and inaccurate or incomplete responses could distort results  iii schools studying the effectiveness of our products may apply different methodologies and data collection techniques  making results difficult to aggregate and compare  iv we facilitate the collection and analysis of data for some of these studies  and v we hire researchers to aggregate and present the results of some of these studies and  in some cases  to conduct the studies 
there is growing demand from the no child left behind act and other sources for research and studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of educational programs and products 
our selling and marketing efforts  as well as our reputation  could be adversely impacted if the public  including our existing and potential customers  is not convinced that the product effectiveness is proven by the studies 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard certain of our technologies as proprietary and rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we also employ serialization techniques to prevent unauthorized installation of our software products and related content 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation 
in addition  while we do not believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such assertions can be material  regardless of whether an assertion is validated 
the software publishing industry has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that our software products will not experience unauthorized reproduction  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling and marketing strategy and product acceptance 
our selling and marketing strategy includes the introduction of new products and services directed at new markets as well as the development of new sales and distribution channels 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offering new products and services  entering new markets and developing new sales and distribution channels or that any such products or services  if introduced  will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
risks of international expansion 
a component of our growth strategy is the expansion of our operations in international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of our approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
educational philosophies 
our products support all teaching methods and curricula by focusing on continuous feedback  increased student practice of essential skills  and demonstrated product effectiveness through measurable results 
certain educators  academics  politicians  and theorists  however  advocate philosophies of instruction that can lead them to oppose certain educational products or services 
these philosophies can include  but are not limited to  opposition to standardized testing or over reliance on the same  opposition to computers or motivational techniques  exclusive focus on particular types of direct instruction  and highly technical definitions of acceptable research 
some of these philosophical stances have the capacity to negatively influence the market for our products and services  and such influence could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services and thus on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
highly competitive industry 
the educational technology and professional development markets in which we operate are very competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other companies offering educational software products  computing devices  interactive response systems  professional development  and technology consulting services to schools 
education continues to emerge as a major global industry and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers  educational publishers  and consulting firms  may enter or 
table of contents increase their focus on the schools market  resulting in greater competition for us 
in addition  we compete against more traditional methods of education  training and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
as we enter into new markets  existing competitors could increase the barriers to entering this market by driving prices lower or making modifications to enhance their products 
success in selling our established products and services may cause competitors to focus on us in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to market our products successfully or compete effectively in the educational marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management 
we do not have employment agreements with these individuals and have no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of our products and to attract and retain qualified additional employees trained in computer technology  sales  marketing  finance  and other disciplines to enhance our product offerings and broaden our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
we generally deliver products as orders are received 
the quantity of product orders in any quarter can be affected by a variety of factors  including delays in the development and or shipment of new products  the closing of large contract sales  such as those to school districts  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for a period of time  and seasonal variations due to  among other things  the budget and school year cycles of our school customers and annual ordering patterns related to subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader enterprise and accelerated math enterprise 
in addition  our quarterly results can also be affected by charges related to acquisitions and divestitures  including related expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of intangible assets  asset impairments and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired tangible assets  intangible assets  goodwill  capitalized software development costs and similar items  supply chain issues such as manufacturing problems  delivery delays  component shortages  strikes or quality issues  expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives  seasonal variability of product support costs  and seasonal variations due to delays in quiz order patterns as customers consider upgrading to accelerated reader enterprise  our turn key solution  which includes all quiz content 
our overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of software  hardware and service sales 
we realize higher margins on our software product sales than our hardware and service sales 
some of our revenues tend to be seasonal due to annual school budget cycles  customer preferences as to when products and services are delivered and the timing of our larger professional development events  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations 
table of contents and or new products by us and our competitors  earnings releases and earnings warnings by us and our competitors  expectations regarding government funding levels for education  market conditions in the industry  announcements by us of significant acquisitions and or divestitures  and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if we fail to meet our forecasts or the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of our results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of our common stock 
war  acts of war and terrorism 
delays and reductions in purchases of our products and services may occur as a result of war  acts of war and terrorism  and the related impacts  including a reduction of funds available to our customers to purchase our products and services and disruptions in our ability to develop  produce and distribute products and services to our customers 
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of february   our principal shareholders  judith paul and terrance paul  our chairman and chief executive officer  respectively  and co founders of the company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these principal shareholders have the ability to control and direct our business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of february   approximately million shares of our common stock were held by affiliates and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  we have filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan espp  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
we did not offer the espp to our employees in  or and have no intention of offering it in cash dividends 
we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in the first and second quarter of and in the third and fourth quarter of we also declared a special dividend of per share during our dividend policy may be affected by  among other things  our views on potential future capital requirements  including those related to research and development  creation and expansion of sales distribution channels  acquisitions  legal risks and stock repurchases 
our dividend policy may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts 
a change in our dividend policy could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by laws provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt 
divestitures 
from time to time  we may  for any number of reasons  determine it is in our best interests and in the interests of our shareholders to dispose of a business or product line 
divestitures involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  and unanticipated costs and liabilities 
if we are unable to manage the divestiture process successfully or if we are incorrect in our assumptions regarding the costs associated with a disposition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  computerized hardware products and related services 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of educational software and hardware 
revenue from sales of hardware is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue recognition from sales of our software depends on whether the software is i off the shelf or customized and ii whether it is licensed on a perpetual basis or as a subscription 
we recognize revenue from off the shelf perpetually licensed software sales upon delivery to customers 
subscription based software sales are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
sales of software that require substantial modification or customization are recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and deferred revenues from software that require substantial modification or customization are not significant in any of the years presented 
service revenue is primarily derived from i product support services  ii professional development and product training seminars and conferences  iii application hosting  iv technical services  v consulting and vi other remote services 
product support services included with sales of perpetual software licenses has a duration of months or less and the associated revenue is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from professional development and product training seminars and conferences is recognized when the seminar or conference is held 
revenue from other product support services and application hosting is initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  typically months 
revenue from technical services  consulting and other remote services is recognized as the services are performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
deferred revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and services not yet performed  ii advance invoicing on contracts and iii that portion of product support agreements and subscription based product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
it is our practice to announce new products prior to when the products are ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in fluctuations in backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for seminars and conferences are generally received from customers in advance of the events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive solution consisting of products and services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have higher revenue and higher revenue growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of our software and hardware products and the delivery of services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as our alphasmart laptops  optical mark card scanners  interactive response systems  educational products  training materials  manuals and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs and v other overhead costs 
we realize higher gross margins on our software sales than on our hardware and service sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales  beginning when the product is 
table of contents available for general release  using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally estimated to be months 
acquisition and divestiture on june   we acquired alphasmart  inc  a provider of affordable  laptop computing solutions for k schools 
the results of alphasmart s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
in february  we consummated the sale of our generation subsidiary  a non core part of our business 
the results of generation  for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  are reflected as discontinued operations 
amounts referred to in this item relate to continuing operations  except as otherwise indicated 
results of operations our results of operations can be affected by many factors including the general economic environment  state and federal budgetary decisions and the length and complexity of the sales cycle for school districts 
national trends  federal and state legislation  department of education administrative policies and the way the foregoing align with our products and services can impact our business 
an important component of our software product strategy is a transition to a subscription based software sales model 
we believe that a business model based on subscription based software offers long term advantages over traditional perpetual licensing  including i improved product utilization leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction  ii product adoption by more schools  iii more lifetime revenue per customer and iv a more predictable and reliable revenue stream 
this transition can significantly impact reported financial results and customer ordering patterns 
an increasing proportion of customer orders attributable to our subscription based product and service offerings relative to customer orders of non subscription based offerings can result in a significant portion of a period s sales being initially deferred and recognized as revenue in future periods over the subscription term  generally months 
this can result in reported revenue that significantly lags customer orders in a given period 
transitioning to subscription based software can also adversely impact revenue as our customers that already own our products under perpetual license agreements may delay purchases of expansions  reading quizzes and math libraries while they are contemplating a transition to subscription based versions of our products 
also  after customers transition to our subscription based enterprise products  they no longer order reading quizzes and math libraries since this content is included in their subscription 
we believe that these factors influenced our results of operations in both and to a lesser extent in our renaissance place products are often sold at the school district level 
district level sales are more complex  have a longer sales cycle  and are typically for a larger dollar amount than sales made to individual schools 
thus  revenues from district sales can be more uneven and are more difficult to accurately predict 
consequently  our revenues and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the timing of large district orders 
since our renaissance place product and service offerings are typically sold on a subscription basis with a term of months  a greater portion of our revenue is initially deferred and recognized into income over the subscription period 
this can cause our revenue to show a greater decline than it would have if these products had been sold as perpetual licenses  for which the revenue is recognized immediately upon shipment 
deferred revenue increased million and million  over the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in deferred revenue during was driven primarily by sales of subscription based enterprise software packages 
we took a one time charge of million in the first quarter of that related to a reorganization of our product development resources and resulted in a reduction in staff and assets related to the laptop line 
our net income and results of operations was impacted in by a million charge that was comprised of separation expenses  primarily for former executives 
items that impacted were i the acquisition of alphasmart  ii the 
table of contents divestiture of generation  iii the sale of our madison  wisconsin office building and iv recognition of the tax benefit related to the settlement of certain state and federal tax positions in the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales  except that individual components of cost of sales and gross profit are shown as a percentage of their corresponding component of net sales for the years ended december  net sales products services total net sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit products services total gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative operating income other  net income continuing operations before income taxes income taxes continuing operations income continuing operations income discontinued operations net income years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales decreased by million or  to million in from million in a significant portion of this decline was related to our customers purchasing more subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader 
revenues from subscription based products are initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the subscription period  generally one year  while the majority of revenues from non subscription based sales are recognized immediately upon delivery 
during  deferred revenue increased by million as compared to an increase of million in customer orders for our products and services increased by approximately million or in as compared to product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in from million in product revenues decreased primarily due to the significant increase in deferred revenue and to a lesser extent due to lower laptop sales 

table of contents service revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in service revenues increased primarily due to order improvements for technical services such as application hosting and installations  and in professional development services  both remote and onsite  partially offset by the impact of not holding a national conference in cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products was in  relatively unchanged from in the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in primarily due to personnel and infrastructure additions that were required for some of our remote and technical services  and to price reductions in some of our on site professional development service offerings 
our overall gross profit margin percentage decreased to in from in this resulted from the lower service margins and the higher proportion of total revenue attributable to services in product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses increased to in from in we capitalized product development expenses of million in compared to million in product development expenses were higher in primarily due to i a million restructuring cost related to a partial reorganization of product development resources for the laptop line in  ii the higher level of software development cost capitalized in than in and iii a million increase in research and development costs related to our united kingdom products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in selling and marketing expenses increased in  partly due to increased commissions as a result of higher customer order levels and partly due to salaries as a result of our sales force expansion  partially offset by lower spending on advertising and direct marketing 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to the impact of a one time executive severance charge taken in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs decreased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from in due to the combined effect of the factors discussed above 
other income 
other income was unchanged at million in and income tax expense continuing operations 
income tax expense of million  from continuing operations  was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income  compared to million  or of pre tax income for the higher tax rate in was primarily the result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for uncertain tax positions  financial interpretation no 
fin 
the method for estimating  accruing and recognizing expenses and benefits of uncertain income tax positions under fin is substantially different than under the previous accounting standard 
years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales decreased by million or  to million in from million in revenues  excluding alphasmart laptops in both periods  declined by million or for the full year 
a significant portion of this decline was related to our customers purchasing more subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader 
revenues from subscription based products are initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the subscription period  generally one year  while the majority of revenues from non subscription based sales are recognized immediately upon delivery 
during  deferred revenue increased by 
table of contents million as compared to an increase of million in we believe that revenue excluding the impact of laptops is a useful metric for investors because it provides a basis upon which to compare the performance of our business  as it existed prior to the june  alphasmart acquisition  to earlier periods 
product revenue  including alphasmart in both periods  decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was driven by the transition to more subscription based sales discussed above and generally lower order rates which impacted most product lines 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of alphasmart s results for the full year in as compared to a partial year in service revenue decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in service revenues were down due to decreased revenue from professional development services  primarily onsite events  which was partially offset by increases in remote services such as consulting and application hosting

the cost of sales of products increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products increased to in from in the product cost of sales percentage increased primarily due to a higher proportion of sales attributable to hardware in as compared to as we realize lower gross profit margins on hardware sales than on software sales 
the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in the higher cost of sales percentage is the result of personnel and infrastructure investments made in  and to reduced pricing of our onsite events 
our overall gross profit margin percentage decreased to in from in this resulted from the higher cost of sales percentages in  from both products and services  as discussed above 
product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses increased to in from in we capitalized product development expenses of million in compared to million in product development spending was higher in due to the inclusion of alphasmart for the full year as compared to only a partial year in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to our sales force expansion  partially offset by reduced marketing expenses as we focus on a more targeted direct marketing approach 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to i a million charge related to separation expenses  primarily for former executives  ii a million increase in share based compensation and iii the inclusion of alphasmart for a full year in as compared to a partial year in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs increased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from in due to the combined effect of the factors discussed above 
other income 
other income decreased million to million in from million in  primarily due to the sale of an office building which generated a million pre tax gain in income tax expense continuing operations 
income tax expense of million  from continuing operations  was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income  compared to million  or of pre tax income for in  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million related to 
table of contents the favorable resolution of certain state and federal tax positions  which was the primary reason for the lower effective tax rate in discontinued operations 
in we realized a gain of approximately million on the sale of generation  which includes a one time tax benefit of million 
when combined with the operating losses incurred in january and february for that subsidiary  the net income from discontinued operations totaled approximately million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were million  down million from the december  total of million 
during  we generated operating cash flow of million 
at december   we had a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank which is available until may  the line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate based on the prime rate less  or a fixed rate for a period of up to days based on libor plus 
the rate is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank available until april  the line of credit bears interest based on the prime rate less 
as of december   the lines of credit had not been used 
on april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares under the stock repurchase program 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
repurchased shares will become treasury shares and will be used for stock based employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes 
during the period of january  through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of million 
since the original authorization of the repurchase program in  we have repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
depending on our stock valuation  cash availability and other factors  we may repurchase additional shares as a beneficial use of our cash to enhance shareholder value 
we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in each of the four quarters of we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in the first and second quarter of and in the third and fourth quarter of we also declared a special dividend of per share during we intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends  subject to capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
we believe our strong cash position coupled with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations including contingent obligations  that would have a material effect on our financial results 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases  primarily for facilities that we occupy in order to carry out our business operations 
we utilize operating leases for some of our facilities to gain flexibility as compared to purchasing facilities outright and limit our exposure to many of the risks of owning commercial property  particularly with regard to international operations 
these agreements are generally for terms of one to five years and cannot be terminated by either the lessor or us for reasons other than breach of the lease agreement 
we do not anticipate early termination of any of these agreements 
for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to these operating leases 

table of contents purchase obligations 
we enter into commitments with certain suppliers to purchase components for our hardware products  such as alphasmart computing devices  accelscan scanners and the know response system 
the majority of these obligations will be satisfied within one year 
tax audit settlements and deposits 
we anticipate making cash payments related to the settlement of tax audits or deposits for unsettled audit issues in the range of to million during the mid point of this range is included in the table below 
estimation of the amounts and timing of payments in periods after are highly uncertain and therefore are not included in the table 
as of december   our approximate contractual obligations for operating leases  tax audit payments and purchase obligations by period due were as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations tax audit related payments purchase obligations total supplemental executive retirement plan 
we have established a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for the provision of retirement benefits to members of our senior management 
under the terms of the plan  participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and invest their deferrals in certain mutual funds which are nearly identical to the investment selections offered to participants in our k retirement plan 
upon a serp participant s retirement or certain other events  we have an obligation to repay the current market value of the participant s account balance 
as of december   we have fully funded the million aggregate contractual obligation for future payments to serp participants 
payouts of our obligations related to the serp are dependant on when participants leave service and how they elect to receive their accrued benefit payments  which can range from a single lump sum payment to a year series of payments 
due to the inherent uncertainties in predicting when the serp obligations will be repaid  they are not included in the above table 
the serp is more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
other obligations 
as of december   we did not hold any long term debt obligations  long term purchase obligations or material capital lease obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a list of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from our software products in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
under this accounting standard  revenue is recognized when the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for perpetually licensed off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii on the 
table of contents percentage of completion basis for software products which require significant customization or modification  iii as seminars are performed for training and professional development services  iv straight line over the term of the support agreement for other software support agreements  v as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for technical and consulting services and vi straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products and services 
accordingly  management is required to make judgments as to whether pricing is fixed and determinable  whether collectibility is reasonably assured and what the percentage of completion is as of the financial reporting date 
expenses are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements 
we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns or doubtful accounts to differ from historical experience 
changes in such allowances may be required if future returns or bad debt activity differs from our estimates 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we assess the value of our goodwill on at least an annual basis by comparing its fair value with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation analysis performed by management using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made regarding future cash flows 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behavior  product acceptance  specific industry factors and changes in interest rates 
in and  our laptop revenues decreased primarily as a result of difficulties in integrating the selling operations of alphasmart into our overall organization 
we believe that our long term strategies will be successful in returning the laptop line to growth and higher levels of profitability 
we have goodwill of million  a trademark of million and other intangibles of million related to the laptop business 
we reviewed the value of these assets for impairment at the end of and our review indicated that there was no impairment at december  the valuation of any long lived asset is inherently subjective and dependent on projections of future operating results 
if we do not achieve the estimated future operating results  or if other key variables and assumptions change  these assets may be impaired in the future 
software support and product warranty obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of software support and hardware warranties at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based upon our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in the cost of providing telephone support and product return rates 
if the actual costs of fulfilling these obligations differ from our estimates  it could result in additional charges to cost of sales in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate anticipated to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  the estimated amount of certain tax credits  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations  if the actual amount of tax credits varies from our estimates  or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
we record a liability for uncertain tax positions based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  there is significant inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and ii the decrease or increase in value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuer  upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness and the insurer of the securities and from changes in general market conditions 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with our corporate investment policy as established by our board of directors 
the goals of the policy are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
our investment policy permits investments in obligations of the us treasury department and its agencies  money market funds  and high quality investment grade corporate and municipal interest bearing obligations 
the policy requires diversification to prevent excess concentration of issuer risk and requires the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels 
the policy precludes investment in equity securities except for the specific purpose of funding the obligations related to our supplemental executive retirement plan see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our investment securities had a market value of approximately million and a carrying value of million 
due to the type and duration of our investments  we do not expect to realize any material gains or losses related to market risk 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the british pound  canadian dollar  euro and indian rupee 
at this time  foreign exchange rate risk is not significant due to the relative size of our foreign operations and revenues derived from sales in foreign currency
