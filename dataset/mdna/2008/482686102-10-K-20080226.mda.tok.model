overview the company designs  develops and markets athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the royal elastics brand 
royal elastics is our wholly owned subsidiary 
the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in part i  item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through our sales executives and independent sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell our products through our website and internationally through company sales managers  independent sales representatives and a number of foreign distributors 
in  approximately of our footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we will have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues decreased in from  due to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold offset by an increase in the average underlying wholesale price  and our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses also increased to of revenues in from of revenues in our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in from due to the sap implementation and on going development related expenses incurred and increases in advertising expenses  compensation expenses  travel related expenses and sample development expenses  offset by a decrease in legal expenses 
in  our largest single marketing expenditure was television 
our marketing campaign was run mainly on network and cable television  and was supported by sports  music and general interest fashion magazines 
our domestic independent sales representatives sold to approximately  separate accounts as of december  down from  as of december  
internationally  by the end of  we were working through international subsidiaries and distributors to market our products in potentially countries 
also  during  the foot locker group of stores and its affiliates accounted for approximately of total revenues  down from during other income for consisted of a reversal of an estimate of our underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  of  at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  a decrease of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  an increase of 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we recognize that the athletic footwear industry is highly competitive 
several makers of footwear with whom we compete have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources as well as greater brand awareness than us 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for decreased and  respectively  to  or per diluted share  compared with  or per diluted share  in in  we had a net cash inflow of approximately  from operating activities and a net cash outflow of  from investing activities due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future growth  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
there was no debt outstanding at december  and and our working capital increased  to approximately  at december  from  at december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see results of operations compared to other income  interest and taxes  for discussion regarding the estimate and settlement of underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivables and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall retail conditions 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions and recognize the benefit exposure of those positions if it meets the more likely than not threshold 
any tax position recognized is an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense on earnings of selected subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to estimated pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of certain items in the consolidated statements of earnings relative to revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income interest income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings compared to revenue and gross margin total revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold  offset by an increase in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold decreased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of 
domestic revenues decreased to  in from  in international product revenues increased in to  from  in fees earned by the company on sales by foreign licensees and distributors were  for and  for  an increase of 
international revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in customer acceptance of our domestic product has been weak and is likely to continue for the near term 
during late early  we hired several individuals in product design and management  however  it will take additional time for the full impact of the contribution of these individuals to affect our business 
k swiss brand revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of footwear sold  offset by higher average wholesale prices per pair 
the volume of footwear sold decreased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of  which resulted from product mix changes and international sales becoming a larger portion of revenues 
the decrease in volume of footwear sold for the year ended december  was due to decreased sales of training  children s  classic and tennis categories of   and  respectively 
royal elastics brand revenues increased to  in domestic from  in domestic as a result of increased sales of lamb product and increased international sales 
we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday season 
we present full line offerings for the easter and back to school seasons  for delivery during the first and third quarters  respectively  but not for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were in and in gross profit margin for was affected by product mix changes and increases in inventory reserves and reserves for prepaid royalties  offset by international sales  which generally yield a higher gross profit margin  becoming a larger portion of revenues 
our gross margins may not be comparable to some of our competitors as we recognize warehousing costs within selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was the result of the sap implementation and on going development related expenses incurred and increases in advertising expenses  compensation expenses  travel related expenses and sample development expenses  offset by a decrease in legal expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  includes  in data conversion  training  training material and development expenses incurred as a result of our domestic and a portion of our international sap computer software implementation 
advertising expenses increased for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in international advertising expenses as part of a strategic effort to drive higher international revenues and was slightly offset by a decrease in domestic advertising expenses to cut costs as result of declining domestic revenues 
compensation expenses  which includes commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  increased for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in headcount and was offset by a decrease in bonus incentive related expenses that were calculated in accordance with the bonus formula under our economic value added eva incentive program 
travel related expenses increased for the year ended december  as a result of increased travel due to our growing international operations and product development efforts 
sample development expenses increased for the year ended december  as a result of our increasing international operations and our efforts to develop our apparel business 
legal expenses decreased for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the court mandated postponements of certain cases  which occurred in the first quarter of corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses for the year ended december  was due to the sap implementation and on going development related expenses incurred  offset by a decrease in legal expenses for the reasons described above 
other income  interest and taxes other income for the year ended december  consists of a reversal of an estimate for our underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  of  as discussed in our form k for  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that there was an underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  in  with the assistance of our tax advisors  we estimated an underpayment of withholdings and related interest totaling  of which  was recorded as a prior period adjustment  under staff accounting bulletin no 
penalties were discretionary  ranging from zero to of the taxes owed  and at that time we could not determine the likelihood of such assessment and did not recognize penalties related to this issue 
the september settlement reached with this foreign jurisdiction resulted in us paying of the payroll withholding liability plus a penalty for periods starting from may  though interest was not assessed 
thus  the amount settled was lower than the amounts previously estimated 
overall net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  an increase of  or 
this increase in net interest income was the result of higher average cash balances and higher average interest rates 
our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the  and  income tax benefit of options exercised during and  respectively  were credited to additional paid in capital and therefore did not impact the effective tax rate 
starting january   provision has not been made for united states income taxes on earnings of selected international subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in was mainly due to our geographic mix of sales  as international sales have become a larger portion of revenues  with these subsidiaries being profitable and to an increase in our tax exempt interest income 
net earnings decreased to  or per share diluted earnings per share in from  or per share diluted earnings per share in adoption of fin no 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
creates a single model to address the accounting for the uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin no 
is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
fin no 
allows the company to prospectively change its accounting policy as to where interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities are classified 
effective january   we changed our accounting policy and began to classify interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings 
prior to january   interest expense and penalties were recognized as a reduction to net interest income and an increase to selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  on our consolidated statement of earnings 
we recognize our uncertain tax positions in either accrued income taxes  if determined to be short term  or other liabilities if determined to be long term  on our consolidated balance sheet 
for federal tax purposes  our through tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three year statute of limitations 
generally  for state tax purposes  our through tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations  however  certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten years 
upon the adoption of fin no 
 we recognized a cumulative effect to beginning retained earnings of  and at december  we recognized uncertain tax positions  net of federal benefit  of  which includes interest  net of federal benefit  of  which was recognized in other liabilities

selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was the result of increases in legal  compensation and warehousing expenses offset by a decrease in advertising expenses 
legal expenses increased in connection with pursuing a lawsuit to protect our trademarks 
compensation expenses  which includes commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  increased primarily due to recognizing compensation expenses related to stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  and an increase in headcount 
these increases in compensation expenses were offset by a decrease in bonus incentive related expenses that were calculated in accordance with our bonus formula under our eva incentive program 
warehousing expenses  other than compensation and compensation related expenses  increased primarily as a result of higher freight and supply costs 
advertising expenses decreased  primarily due to a decrease in domestic advertising expenses from an effort to reduce costs as a result of declining domestic revenues offset by an increase in our international advertising expenses as part of a strategic effort to drive higher international revenues 
corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses during the year ended december  was due to an increase in legal expenses  as explained above 
adoption of sfas no 
revised on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised using the modified prospective method 
in accordance with sfas no 
revised  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
we determine the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of these options 
for the year ended december   we recognized  in compensation costs 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
revised 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
for the year ended december   we recognized  in compensation costs 
however  pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share disclosures were provided as if the fair value of all stock options as of the grant date were recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with sfas no

sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
we adopted sab no 
in the fourth quarter of the transition provisions of sab no 
permit us to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of immaterial errors relating to prior years 
sab no 
also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented 
such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the sec to be amended 
in  we determined that there was an underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  with the assistance of our tax advisors  we estimated underpayment of withholdings of approximately  and related interest of approximately  totaling  we finalized the amount owed with the government agency in september amounts relating to january through december  were  net of taxes  and were recognized by us in the fourth quarter of amounts relating to january  through december  were  for the same period  it was determined that eva bonuses be reduced by approximately  which also resulted in a decrease of the related deferred tax asset of approximately  the federal income tax benefit related to these adjustments for prior years was approximately  in accordance with sab no 
 we adjusted beginning retained earnings for the year ended december  by  penalties were discretionary  ranging from zero to of the taxes owed  and at that time we could not determine the likelihood of such assessment and did not recognize penalties related to this issue 
however  at the time there was no guarantee that penalties would not be imposed 
we believe that the net effect of these adjustments were not material  either quantitatively or qualitatively  in any of the years affected 
in reaching that determination  the following measures were considered dollar amounts in thousands year net after tax effect of adjustment reported net income percent of reported net income total liquidity and capital resources we experienced a net cash inflow of approximately   and  from our operating activities during  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in decreased from due primarily to the decrease in net earnings and to the difference in the amounts in changes in inventories  offset by changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities and by the excess income tax benefit of stock based compensation 
cash provided by operations in decreased from due primarily to differences in the amounts in changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  inventories and by the difference in the changes in the income tax benefit of stock options exercised and by the excess income tax benefit of stock based compensation  offset by stock based compensation 
we had a net outflow of cash of   and  from our investing activities during  and  respectively  due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the increase in investment in and is primarily due to the implementation of sap information management software 
in and over the next few years we will continue our implementation of sap information management software in our domestic and international operations 
in  and  the net outflow of cash of   and  respectively  from our financing activities was used for the purchase of our outstanding stock under our current stock repurchase program and to pay cash dividends  partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised 
for and  cash outflows from our financing activities were also offset by the excess income tax benefit of stock based compensation 
for  cash outflows from financing activities were also due to net repayments on borrowings on our bank lines of credit 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit facilities 
in addition  depending on our future growth rate  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
no other material capital commitments exist at december  with continued use of our revolving credit facility as discussed below  we believe our present and currently anticipated sources of capital are sufficient to sustain our anticipated capital needs for the remainder of on october   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to supplement prior stock repurchase programs  which allows us to repurchase through december  up to  shares of our class a common stock from time to time on the open market  as market conditions warrant 
as of december   a maximum of  shares may be repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
we adopted this program because we believe that depending upon the then array of alternatives  repurchasing our shares can be a good use of excess cash 
currently  we have made purchases under all stock repurchase programs from august through february  the day prior to the filing of this form k of million shares at an aggregate cost totaling approximately  at an average price of per share

in february  our bank waived this covenant violation 
our working capital increased  to  at december  from  at december  working capital increased during mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets balances  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balance and an increase in accrued liabilities balance at december  compared to december  we have historically maintained higher levels of inventories relative to sales compared to our competitors because we do not ship directly to our major domestic customers from our foreign contract manufacturers to the same extent as our larger competitors  which would reduce inventory levels and increase inventory turns  and unlike many of our competitors  we designate certain shoes as core products whereby we commit to our retail customers that we will carry core products from season to season and  therefore  we attempt to maintain open stock positions on our core products in our distribution facilities to meet at once orders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and pound sterling 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our primary risk exposures are from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and pound sterling 
in and  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars and pounds sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to settle in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require us to exchange euros for us dollars or pounds sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
our counterparty to derivative transactions is a major financial institution with an investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with this institution 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should this counterparty fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies with maturities ranging from january to august  to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy  at contracted rates 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts of  and  have been recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet 
realized losses of   and  from cash flow hedges were recorded in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  respectively 
realized losses of  and realized gains of  and  from cash flow hedges were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses due to hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term borrowings on our working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses in order to partially or completely offset rising prices  without experiencing a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings
