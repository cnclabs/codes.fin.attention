item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those described in such statements is contained below and in item a risk factors of this report 
overview we are a commercial finance company that provides customized debt financing solutions to middle market businesses and commercial real estate borrowers 
we principally focus on the direct origination of loans that meet our risk and return parameters 
our direct origination efforts target private equity sponsors  corporate executives  regional banks  real estate investors and a variety of other financial intermediaries to source transaction opportunities 
direct origination provides direct access to customers management  enhances due diligence  and allows significant input into customers capital structure and direct negotiation of transaction pricing and terms 
we operate as a single segment 
at december   we derived revenues from three specialized lending groups middle market corporate  which originates  structures and underwrites senior debt and  to a lesser extent  second lien  mezzanine and subordinated debt  and equity and equity linked products for companies with annual ebitda typically between million and million  commercial real estate  which originates  structures and underwrites first mortgage debt and  to a lesser extent  subordinated debt  primarily to finance acquisitions of real estate properties typically valued between million and million  and structured products  which originates  structures and underwrites senior and subordinated debt for small and mid sized specialty finance companies with assets typically between million and million 
subsequent to december   we discontinued the origination of structured products and continue to manage the remaining portfolio 
as part of our strategy of discontinuing this lending activity  earlier in this year  on june   we completed the sale of securities and loans totaling million  including million of rmbs holdings to a non recourse  off balance sheet financing vehicle and recognized a million loss on the sale 
we retained a residual interest in the assets sold  which had a fair value of million at december  as of march   the remaining structured products portfolio had an outstanding balance of million comprised of nine loans and six debt securities 
recent developments on november   we entered into a definitive agreement with institutional investors to issue million shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price per share of 
the gross proceeds from the offering  which closed in two tranches  were million 
the first tranche of million shares closed on november  the second tranche of million shares closed on january  as of december   we had three loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million classified as impaired 
two of these impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million were also placed on non accrual status during the three months ended december  during  we recorded million of specific provisions for impaired loans 
on october   we received a million partial payoff from a borrower of an impaired loan and recognized a loss of million  which was applied to a previously established specific reserve as a charge off 

table of contents market conditions during the second half of  conditions in the credit markets deteriorated significantly 
what began as a severe and rapid dislocation in the sub prime mortgage and related securities markets  which was primarily prompted by falling home values and rising mortgage delinquencies and defaults  has broadened into the general credit market and has affected an array of financial institutions 
the resulting disruption in credit markets has led to a significant reduction in market liquidity  downward pressure on financial asset valuations  a re pricing of risk to reflect higher costs  and a reduction of leverage across the financial system 
since the end of our fiscal year at december   the dislocation in the credit markets has continued 
compounding liquidity issues in these markets  the outlook for the economy is increasingly uncertain as credit is constrained and activity slows 
bank loan markets are also experiencing significant volatility with heightened selling pressure led largely by concerns about de leveraging of certain types of investment vehicles 
this negative environment is further impacted by the overhang of a large inventory of unsold leveraged loan positions that are aging on banks balance sheets 
as a result  we expect to experience greater difficulty and higher cost in securing term debt financing for our loan portfolio 
the financings we completed in the second half of were more expensive and provided lower advance rates than similar transactions we completed in prior periods 
while we expect to be negatively impacted by the trend toward higher cost of borrowing and lower leverage in  we believe that we will also benefit from these market conditions by re pricing our existing loans higher when possible  and originating new loans with more favorable terms and significantly higher yields 
results of operations for the years ended december   and newstar s basic and diluted loss per share for was on a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million for and a net loss of million for during the year our managed loan portfolio grew to billion from billion at december  and million at december  during  loans owned by the ncof increased million to million at year end

the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily driven by the growth in loans of billion from december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of million to fund growth in interest earning assets  as well as an increase in our cost of borrowings

we have and continue to monitor the recent developments in the consumer residential mortgage market 
we periodically evaluate both our exposure to and events within this market 
the million impairment charge during is a result of these evaluations 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  to million for from million for employee compensation and benefits increased million primarily as a result of the compensation charge of million non cash charge related to restricted stock grants made since our inception  including equity awards made in connection with the initial public offering  higher headcount and an increase in incentive and equity compensation

as of december   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million  which was fully utilized in 
table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations  credit facilities  term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity offerings 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our operations  projected lending activities and other short term liquidity needs 
our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily based on the growth rate in our loan portfolio 
to fund our loan portfolio growth  we anticipate that we will need to incur additional indebtedness  enter into additional term debt securitizations or raise equity capital 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital based on various factors  including if our loan portfolio grows faster than anticipated  we are unable to fund certain loans with credit facilities or term debt securitizations  or if our cash flow from operations is lower than expected 
we may not be able to raise such debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all 
the incurrence of additional debt will increase our leverage and interest expense  and the issuance of any debt or equity securities may be dilutive for existing shareholders 
the debt financings we completed in the second half of were more expensive and provided lower advance rates than similar transactions we completed in prior periods 
we expect the trend toward higher cost of borrowing and lower leverage to continue in given current market conditions  we believe executing a traditional term debt securitization could be difficult and will be executed as private placements and one off transactions 
moreover we may not be able to renew our credit facilities with maturities in at similar advance rates  interest rate spreads or at their current commitment levels 
on november   we entered into a definitive agreement with institutional investors to issue million shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price per share of 
the gross proceeds from the offering  which closed in two tranches  were million 
the first tranche of million shares closed on november  the second tranche of million shares closed on january  cash and cash equivalents as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents

from time to time  we may use a portion of our non restricted cash to pay down our credit facilities 
restricted cash we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and december   respectively 
the restricted cash represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre funding amounts in our credit facilities  our term debt securitizations and customer holdbacks and escrows 
the use of the principal collection accounts cash is limited to funding the growth of our loan portfolio within the facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations 
the interest collection account cash is limited to the payment of interest  servicing fees and other expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and  if either a ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the ramp up period or if coverage ratios are not met  paying down principal with respect thereto 
cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash balance at december  asset quality and allowance for loan losses if a loan is days or more past due or if management believes that there is reasonable doubt as to collectibility in the normal course of business  it is our policy to place the loan on non accrual status 
when a loan is on non accrual status  accrued interest previously recognized as interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed  and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until 
table of contents factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and is in the process of collection

at december   the loan has a carrying value of million 
as our loan portfolio continues to season  we expect to experience additional credit issues  delinquencies  losses  specific reserves and charge offs as part of our normal course of business 
if a loan is days or more past due we will categorize the loan as delinquent 
as of december   we did not have any delinquent loans 
despite our limited historical loss experience  we have provided an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loans in our loan portfolio

at december   the maturities of these agreements ranged from one to three months with a weighted average interest rate of

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
we seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
as such  we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities 
under the interest rate swap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of operations 
under the interest rate cap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between a specified fixed the cap and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount  but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate 
the interest rate caps currently are not matched to specific assets or liabilities and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we also offer a fixed rate loan program to certain of our customers which utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and interest rate collars 
we provide floating interest rate debt to our customers  and to reduce default risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into interest rate swap  cap and collar contracts with these customers 
subsequently  we may enter into similar offsetting contracts with third parties  or customer derivatives 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges  including any cash payments made or received  are reported as gain loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in our interest payments on libor based debt 
the interest rate swap agreements have a combined notional value of million and are effective from june  through october  during  we recorded hedge ineffectiveness of approximately  which is included in gain loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers 
these financial instruments include unfunded commitments  standby letters of credit and interest rate mitigation products 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower  provided that all conditions have been met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral required is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
at december   we had million of unfunded commitments 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers 
at december  we had million of standby letters of credit 
interest rate risk mitigation products are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and risk management objectives 
derivative financial instruments consist predominantly of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors 
the interest rate risks to the company of these customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties 
at december   the notional value of the interest rate mitigation products was million 
on june   we completed the sale of securities and loans totaling million  including million of rmbs holdings to a non recourse  off balance sheet financing vehicle and recognized a million loss on the sale 
we retained a residual interest in the assets sold  which had a fair value of million at june   million at september  and million at december  our valuation of the residual involves two basic assumptions i a forecast of cash flows from the underlying collateral  and ii a discount rate applied to those cash flows 
the valuation of the residual performed as of june  used a discount rate of 
this rate was established by modeling the pool to create cdo tranches of aaa through bbb  which reflected a mix of debt in place against those assets and reflected an estimated market rate at that time 
the loss for was driven by the following factors  i further deterioration in the performance of the underlying rmbs collateral assets impacting the anticipated cash flows  ii the decision by the lender to end the reinvestment period  transitioning the facility to amortize with of the cash flow used to pay down the debt  and iii increasing the discount rate applied to the valuation model 
at september  and december   we increased the discount rate to to reflect the general widening of spreads in the marketplace  and have made no changes to our general approach in projecting future liquidations losses 
the change in the fair value of the residual interest is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on our financial statements  are considered critical accounting policies 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
table of contents revenue recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loan and debt product 
the accrual of interest on loans and other debt products is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due by days or more or when  in the opinion of management  there is a reasonable doubt as to the collectibility in the normal course of business 
if loans are placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
interest income on non accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible 
nonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans and other debt products are deferred and netted against balances outstanding 
the net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using a method which approximates the effective interest method 
in connection with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product  a partial amount of the remaining unamortized net deferred fees  costs  premiums or discounts are accelerated and recognized as interest income 
the amortization of fees is discontinued on non accrual loans 
depending on the terms of a loan or other debt product  we may charge a prepayment fee and recognize it in the period of the prepayment 
we accrete any discount and amortize any premium from purchased debt products into interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life 
syndication  arrangement and structuring fees are recognized in the period the service is completed as a component of non interest income 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is based on a loan by loan build up of inherent losses on loans  gross 
we also maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments  namely loan commitments and letters of credit that are reported in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the methodology for determining the allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments is consistent with the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and incorporates a uniform probability of drawdown 
the combined balance of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   we had an allowance for credit losses of million  with specific allowances totaling million 
we review the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and its two components on a quarterly basis 
the estimate of each component is based on observable information and on market and third party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
these estimates are not based on actual losses related to our loans and may not reflect future performance 
over time  as our loans season  we expect to supplement market and third party data with the actual credit performance of our loans 
in addition  we anticipate that the number of delinquent and non accrual loans and loan impairments and charge offs will increase as our portfolio expands and seasons over time 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we provide a base allowance for loans that are not impaired 
we employ a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk probability of default  loss given default  exposure at default  seasoning and credit migration  which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  any required impairment allowances are included in the allowance for loan losses and  as such  may require an additional provision for the relevant period 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  
table of contents depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
during the three months ended september   we determined we had our first two impaired loans and as of december   we had three impaired loans 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
the provision for credit losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
valuation of investments in debt securities we review the fair value of our other debt products quarterly 
the fair value of our investments in debt securities  non investment grade securities and residual securities  are based on independent third party quoted market prices  when available  at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
when no market is available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis and internally generated financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments  as well as qualitative factors 
even if the general accuracy of our valuation models are validated  there are no assurances that our valuations are accurate because of the high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures  which differ on each securitization 
valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of these assets 
a debt product is considered impaired when the fair value of the debt product declines below its amortized cost 
the cost basis of the investment is then written down to fair value 
if management determines the impairment to be temporary  it is recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if management determines the impairment to be permanent  it is recorded as an offset to other income on our statements of operations 
from time to time we may become aware of cash flow or credit issues with respect to our other debt products and these other debt products are then monitored by management to determine if a write down is appropriate 
although we view write downs of our other debt products as a normal and anticipated aspect of our business  material write downs of the fair value of our other debt products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   we had three debt products with a combined fair value of million that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
as a result  during we recorded an impairment charge  or write down  in other income of million related to these debt products 
our allowance for credit losses does not cover these write downs as we classify these assets as available for sale and are accounted for under the guidelines of fas no 
and eitf in the past  we invested in the rmbs market and are exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying these investment securities 
as of december   we had million of rmbs debt products 
the performance of our investment securities may be negatively impacted by among other things the timing of losses  higher than expected levels of credit losses or prepayment speeds on the underlying mortgages or home equity loans  depending on the specific structure of each securitization 
most of our investments are in classes of securities which are not actively traded in secondary markets or have lower levels of liquidity 
the fair value of securities and other investments that have such liquidity characteristics may not be readily ascertained 
this situation may be further exacerbated by current market conditions 
the description of certain instruments as debt securities is intended to describe the accounting treatment of those instruments and is not a characterization of those instruments as securities for any other purpose 

table of contents valuation of residual interest in securitization we review the fair value of our residual interest quarterly 
the fair value of our residual interest is based on forecasted cash flows  discount rates  expected credit losses and prepayment speeds for the individual loans and securities 
we recognize changes in the fair value of the residual interest as gains or losses on our statement of operations 
in addition  the fair value determined at any time may not be accurate due to a high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures 
our determination of fair value will be highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our internal cash flow model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that currently may not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the residual interest  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of the residual interest which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows on the individual assets may be higher or lower than those that might be employed by a third party 
to value the assets  we use historical performance data at the time of determination and assumptions about delinquencies  losses  severities and prepayment speeds in the future  including assumptions about the timing of these variables  in arriving at estimates of future cash flows on the individual assets 
these assumptions are influenced by historical experience in the respective asset classes and with particular originations and servicers 
within the various rmbs asset classes  assumptions and methodologies used by us are generally consistent among the various assets within each class and generally consistent with past forecasting techniques used by us 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  which required the recognition of compensation cost for the excess  if any  of the value of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january   we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected term and expected price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock based compensation and the related expense to be recognized 
further  for awards that contain performance measures and conditions  we make an assessment  based on management s judgment  of the probability of these conditions being satisfied  which affects the timing and the amount of expense to be recognized 
if our judgment as to whether these conditions are probable of occurrence are not appropriate  the financial statements could be materially affected 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and 
table of contents whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
in performing these reviews we make estimates about future profits and tax planning strategies that would affect future taxable income and the realization of these deferred tax assets 
a change in these assumptions could result in a difference in valuation and impact our results of operations 
on january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
a company can only recognize the tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be upheld on audit  based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also addresses how interest and penalties should be accrued for uncertain tax positions  requiring that interest expense should be recognized in the first period interest would be accrued under the tax law 
the company classifies all interest and penalties on recognized tax benefits as a part of income tax expense 
at january   the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties 
at january  and december   the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits  and there have been no material changes since adoption 
the company does not expect any significant changes within the next months 
the company files us federal and us state tax returns 
as of december   the company s tax returns for the years ended  and year of the company s inception remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service and state tax authorities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in market values of our loans held for sale  which are carried at lower of cost or market  and our investment in debt securities  available for sale and derivatives  which are carried at fair value 
fair value is defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives  fair value is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
where a market quotation is not readily available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis  as well as qualitative factors 
as of december  and december   investments in debt securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively  and our net unrealized loss on those debt securities totaled million and million  respectively 
any unrealized gain or loss on these investments is included in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet  until realized 
the decrease in carrying value is a result of sales in debt securities of million 
interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us 
our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect our net interest income 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
during the normal course of business our lending to clients and our investments in debt securities create some interest rate risk as does the impact of ever changing market conditions 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through our asset liability committee alco process taking into consideration balance sheet dynamics such as loan and investment growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and maturity characteristics 
the alco group reviews the overall rate risk position and strategy on an ongoing basis 
the alco group also reviews the impact on net interest income caused by changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as parallel shifts in the yield curve 
we invested the proceeds from our december initial public offering in short term instruments to permit us ready access to cash in order to fund our directly originated loan growth 
as a result  our sensitivity to interest rate movement has increased 
as the cash is redeployed and we continue to grow our loan portfolio  this interest rate sensitivity as a percentage of earnings will decrease over time 
the following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of december  our modeling is based on contractual terms and does not consider prepayment rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months in thousands decrease of increase of as shown above  we estimate that a decrease in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease of million in our annualized net interest income 
we estimate that an increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase in our net interest income of million
