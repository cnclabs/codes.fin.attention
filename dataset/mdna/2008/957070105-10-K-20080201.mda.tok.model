critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  workers compensation costs  collectibility of accounts receivable  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  contingencies  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes to these policies during fiscal revenue recognition 
we record revenue from the sale of temporary staffing  permanent placement fees  and temp to hire fees by our company owned and franchised operations 
temporary staffing revenue and the related labor costs and payroll taxes are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
temp to hire fees are generally recorded when the temporary employee is hired directly by the customer 
we reserve for billing adjustments  principally related to overbillings and client disputes  made after year end that relate to services performed during the fiscal year 
the reserve is estimated based on historical adjustment data as percent of sales 
permanent placement fees are recorded when the candidate commences full time employment and  if necessary  sales allowances are established to estimate losses due to placed candidates not remaining employed for the permanent placement guarantee period  which is typically days 
we account for our revenue and the related direct costs of our franchise arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  recording revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we first assess whether we act as a principal in our transactions or as an agent acting on the behalf of others 
when we are the principal in a transaction and have the risks and rewards of ownership  we record the transaction gross in our statements of operations 
where we act merely as an agent  only the net fees earned are recorded our statements of operations 
under our traditional franchise agreement  we have the direct contractual arrangements with our customers and the contracts are binding on us 
we are also the employer of all temporary employees in the franchise agents operations and  as such  are obligated for the temporary employee payroll  related payroll taxes and the risk of loss for accounts receivable collection 
as we retain the risks and rewards of ownership  the revenue and costs of services of our franchise agents are included in our results of operations 
each accounting period  we remit to each franchisee either a portion of the gross profit or a portion of the sales generated by its office s  based on what the relevant franchise agreement dictates 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to the franchise agents for their services in marketing to customers  recruiting temporary employees and servicing customer accounts 
we also had a licensing program with a single licensee who converted their business to a franchise operation in fiscal under the licensing program  the licensee had the direct contractual relationships with the customers  held title to the related customer receivables and was the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  revenue and costs of services generated by licensee operations are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we advanced funds for payroll  payroll taxes  insurance and other related items 
fees are paid to us based either on a percentage of revenue or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by us as license fees and included in revenue 
we have not entered into any new licensee arrangements for the periods reported and have no current plans to enter into such arrangements in the future 
workers compensation reserves 
we self insure the deductible amount related to domestic workers compensation claims  which was  per claim for policy years  and we maintain reserves for workers compensation costs based upon actuarial methods utilized to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of all claims  including those incurred but not reported 
this process includes establishing loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and that of the staffing industry and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claims liability 
the calculated ultimate liability is computed for each policy year and is then reduced by the cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserves 
we evaluate the reserve and the underlying assumptions regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
the key assumptions include but are not limited to classification of the work performed and estimates of total loss based on the severity of the injury 
this data is based on past history and includes an estimate of future claims 
at least annually  we obtain an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
these reserves amounted to million and million at november  and october   respectively 
while we believe that the recorded reserves are adequate  there can be no assurances that future  unfavorable changes to estimates relied upon in the determination of these reserves will not occur 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on an estimation of losses which could occur if customers are unable to make required payments 
we evaluate this allowance on a regular basis throughout the year and make adjustments as the evaluation warrants 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these allowances were million at november   and million at october  our estimates are influenced by numerous factors including our large  diverse customer base  which is disbursed across a wide geographical area 
no single customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable for fiscal year goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be subject to an impairment test performed on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the valuation methodologies considered include analyses of estimated future discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  publicly traded companies multiples within the temporary staffing industry and historical control premiums paid by acquirers purchasing companies similar to ours 
as part of the assessment management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon market interest rates and the cost of capital at the valuation date 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment may occur in the future 
we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes by utilizing an asset and liability approach that requires recording deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future year consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon provisions of tax law as currently enacted 
the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
we also provide a reserve for tax contingencies when we believe a probable and estimatable exposure exists 
at october   substantially all of our net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of our positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed our full domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
the company has deferred tax assets on its books from tax benefits from future deductions of workers compensation claims  tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses nol 
the company has generated net income in each of the three years preceding the current year in which a net loss was incurred 
the company believes it will have sufficient future taxable income to support the carrying value of the deferred tax assets 
management made assumptions about revenue growth and gross margin increases based on anticipated bill rate per hour increases  its restructure activities resulting in the closure of branch offices that had underperformed relative to expectations  a new management team with significant industry experience  and new sales initiatives that hope to spur profitable revenue and margin growth to support its view 
if future operating results are not sufficient  then the company will need to set up valuation allowance reserves against these assets which will increase the tax expense recorded on our consolidated statements of operations 
reserves for legal and regulatory liabilities 
there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against us incident to our operations for which we have recorded liabilities that we believe are appropriate 
we evaluate this reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires registrants to use a combination of two approaches to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors the rollover approach  which quantifies an error based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement  and the iron curtain approach  which quantifies an error based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year 
sab permits companies to adjust for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company adopted sab during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no

r  business combinations 
sfas r requires all business combinations completed after the effective date to be accounted for by applying the acquisition method previously referred to as the purchase method 
companies applying this method will have to identify the acquirer  determine the acquisition date and purchase price and recognize at their acquisition date fair values the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree 
in the case of a bargain purchase the acquirer is required to reevaluate the measurements of the recognized assets and liabilities at the acquisition date and recognize a gain on that date if an excess remains

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb 
sfas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary

in addition this statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas becomes effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas executive overview fiscal was a year of significant change which included the sale of of the outstanding stock from the founder and former chairman of the board to hig capital llc s affiliate  delstaff  llc in a private transaction  the addition of a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer and a restructure of its domestic operations which included a reduction from eight geographic regions to four geographic regions and the closure of branch offices located in the united states

discontinued operations effective june   we sold our norway and denmark operations to personalhuset as  a recruitment and staffing company headquartered in norway 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
of the total proceeds  approximately million were being held in an interest bearing escrow account as security for potential westaff norway pension claims 
the escrowed funds  net of any claim payments  were received in fiscal we recorded a net gain on the sale of million in fiscal we have classified the operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto 
as required under the terms of our multicurrency credit agreement  the net proceeds from the sale of the norway and denmark operations were used to pay down borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
interest expense has been allocated to these discontinued operations in accordance with eitf results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of revenue 
fiscal year revenue costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring expenses operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income loss income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit provision income loss from continuing operations less than fiscal compared to fiscal revenue gross revenue declined by million or to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal contained weeks 
the estimated sales for the extra week in fiscal were million 
the decrease for a comparable week year would have been million or 
the decrease was primarily caused by a decline of million or to million in domestic revenue 
the decline was attributable to a number of factors the closure of unprofitable offices in fiscal  changes in management and field structure  the termination of unprofitable customer relationships and a softening economy 
within our remaining branches  we have continued to focus our sales efforts on opportunities yielding a higher gross margin 
total billable hours declined in fiscal compared to fiscal on a comparable week basis the decline in total billable hours would have been with the significant decline being driven in the domestic market primarily as a result of the closed offices 
the average bill rate for fiscal increased from fiscal over fiscal in constant us dollars 
offsetting the domestic revenue decrease was an increase in international revenue of million or to million 
the largest cause of this increase was a million increase in revenue from our australian subsidiary of which approximately million was a result of the rd week in fiscal the balance of the increase was principally caused by a decline in the us dollar against the australian dollar from fiscal against fiscal and the addition of two new significant customers in fiscal billable hours increased by together with an increase in the billing rate in local currency of 
hours on a comparable week year decreased from fiscal in addition to the increase noted in australia  revenue from our united kingdom operations increased million or to million 
on a weekly basis  total sales were relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal and the increase was principally caused by a decline in the us dollar to the british pound from fiscal to fiscal billable hours in the united kingdom declined in fiscal from fiscal and would have shown a decline of on a comparable week period from fiscal to fiscal the decline in billable hours was offset by an increase in the bill rate in fiscal of over fiscal costs of services and gross profit costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
on a consolidated basis  costs of services decreased million or to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the average salary cost per hour increased by in over fiscal which was in line with the increase in the hourly rate per billable hour 
this overall decrease in costs of services  coupled with the decrease in revenue noted above  caused gross profit to decrease by  to million 
however  gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased to as compared to for fiscal gross margin increased slightly as the company focused on eliminating less profitable work including subcontracting work that was performed at significantly lower margins 
our domestic workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic workers compensation costs were and for fiscal and  respectively 
as a percent of domestic direct labor costs  state unemployment rates decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease assisted our efforts to manage consolidated costs of services in fiscal we continue to focus our efforts on improving gross margin by shifting our business mix to those opportunities offering higher margins and increasing billing rates 
we have also refocused our efforts domestically on our sales force and are hopeful that we will continue to effectively manage our cost structure to allow us to continue improving gross margins into fiscal however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in that regard 
franchise agents share of gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit decreased million or to million for fiscal but remained flat as a percent of total sales at 
the decrease was caused by a decrease in gross receipts from our franchise offices of in fiscal as compared to fiscal selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal there were numerous factors which drove the increase  the largest of which was an increase in incentive compensation of million of which over of the increase related to international operations 
the other significant increases  totaling million  reflected guaranteed amounts paid under a new corporate program designed to retain staff following the restructuring  a bonus program for technical implementation of the third phase of the bpm project  and a guaranteed bonus to the new ceo 
the company also experienced an increase of million in recruiting costs associated with a domestic national contract for internet job boards utilized by field offices to attract and identify associates  the recruitment of several new senior executives as well as field sales personnel hired to increase domestic sales 
these increases were partially offset by million in salary costs that are classified as restructuring expenses 
health benefit expense increased or to million in fiscal from fiscal the company provides health benefits to its employees and shares the cost of the program through payroll deductions 
the company is partially self insured up to a limit of  per employee per year and actuarially calculates the amount of incurred but not reported claims at year end 
the increased cost of providing these services together with an increase in the estimate of unprocessed claims caused the increase in fiscal professional fees and outside services increased or million to million in fiscal caused principally by an increase in the cost of administering our work opportunity tax credit wotc program administration costs 
this program had been suspended for a period of time in fiscal and the retroactive reinstatement of the program resulted in increased costs 
professional fees also increased following the departure of several key personnel including the company s chief legal counsel  chief financial officer and controller and various other corporate employees who left the company following the shareholder transaction previously discussed 
these positions have since been filled but the company relied heavily on outside resources while searching to replace these positions 
bad debt expense net of recoveries increased or million to million in fiscal million of the increase resulted from charge offs of trade accounts receivables from domestic operations as the collectibility of a number of accounts were challenged by new senior management 
the primary component of the increase related to million of receivables that related to billings generated in and prior that were deemed uncollectible in fiscal the remaining increase in bad debt expense resulted primarily from reserves on notes receivables from franchise holders 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by million or to million  primarily due to certain technology related assets becoming fully depreciated early in the year 
the company spent significant resources on the third phase of its bpm system which was originally anticipated to be implemented during fiscal the bpm system was placed in service in and did not start depreciating until the first quarter of fiscal restructuring expense in the third quarter of fiscal  the company approved certain restructuring plans to  among other things  reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities 
restructuring charges have been recorded to align the company s cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
the company s restructuring charges have been comprised primarily of i severance and termination benefit costs related to the reduction of our workforce and ii lease termination costs 
the company accounted for each of these costs in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the restructuring resulted in the elimination of field positions  the closure of branches prior to their lease termination and a reduction in the number of our geographic regions from eight to four 
the company recorded an expense in fiscal of million associated with the restructuring plan which includes an estimated liability for leased locations based on the future minimum lease payments reduced by estimated sublease income 
interest expense and interest income interest expense increased or million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher average interest rates which included an increase in our borrowing rate of under the terms of our forbearance agreement which was executed october  but retroactive to the date of default  july  the rate increase was imposed on actual borrowings and letters of credits issued to our insurance administrator to secure outstanding worker compensation liabilities 
the increased rates were offset by lower borrowing amounts during the fiscal year 
interest income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal mainly due to increased amounts on deposit in the earlier part of the fiscal year income tax provision we record income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
although we had a pretax book loss in fiscal  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in future years 
the income tax provision recorded during fiscal and differs from statutory rates primarily due to federal tax credits we take advantage of  primarily as a result of the work opportunity tax credit program 
in addition  the fiscal tax provision also derives a substantial tax benefit from net operating losses generated in the current fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue increased to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal domestic revenue increased to million  largely due to an increase in average bill rates of  coupled with an increase in permanent placement revenue of 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in billed hours of  which reflects the effects of a shift in business mix in an effort to increase gross margin 
the increase in average bill rates primarily stems from a bill rate increase implemented in may  coupled with a generally more positive economic environment in fiscal compared to fiscal  which allowed us to price new business at higher rates as compared to fiscal further  the increase in our domestic permanent placement revenue is the result of both our focused training efforts and having a full complement of permanent placement consultants in place for fiscal the hiring of these consultants commenced in the latter half of fiscal as a percentage of revenue  domestic permanent placement fees increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal offsetting the domestic revenue growth was a decrease in international revenue of to million 
the largest cause of this decrease was a million decrease in revenue from our australian subsidiary  primarily due to decreased revenue from several large  national accounts 
billed hours decreased in australia  and the average bill rate remained essentially the same in fiscal as it had been in fiscal partially offsetting this decrease in temporary services revenue was an increase in australia s permanent placement revenue of or million 
in addition to the decrease noted in australia  revenue from our united kingdom operations decreased to million 
this is primarily the result of a decrease in billable hours and average bill rates remaining essentially the same in fiscal as compared to fiscal the united kingdom operations were without a managing director for much of fiscal and  consequently  the operation did not have as robust a focus on sales as it should have  resulting in an overall decrease in revenue 
finally  revenue from our new zealand operations decreased to million 
billable hours for temporary services decreased while the average bill rate decreased  primarily due to the loss of one national account  the volume of which was not replaced during the fiscal year 
costs of services and gross profit costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
on a consolidated basis  costs of services decreased to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to an overall decrease in billable hours of  partially offset by an overall increase in average pay rates of 
this overall decrease in costs of services  coupled with the increase in revenue noted above  caused gross profit to increase to million  and also caused gross margin to increase to in fiscal as compared to for fiscal gross margin increased primarily as a result of bill rate increases and increases in permanent placement revenue  both explained above  coupled with stabilization of workers compensation costs and state unemployment insurance costs as explained below 
our domestic workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial 
unexpected adverse development of open claims and increases in our incurred but not reported ibnr claims can also significantly affect workers compensation costs 
we monitor claim activity and evaluate actuarial estimates to ensure that accruals and resulting costs remain appropriate in light of loss trends 
further  we aggressively work to close out claims on terms that are favorable to us and continually monitor costs and accrual rates in light of actual loss trends 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic workers compensation costs remained stable at for both fiscal and as a percent of domestic direct labor costs  state unemployment rates remained stable at for both fiscal and fiscal this stabilization assisted our efforts to manage consolidated costs of services in fiscal franchise agents share of gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit decreased from of revenue for fiscal to for fiscal  primarily due to the conversion of two franchised operations into company owned operations 
during the second fiscal quarter of  we acquired our houston  texas  franchised operations and at the beginning of our third fiscal quarter  we acquired our raleigh  north carolina  franchised operation 
therefore  upon acquisition  we maintained revenue streams from these operations yet were no longer paying out a portion of the gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to million for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is due to a combination of cost increases  including increased domestic salaries relating to revenue producing staff placed into our field offices in the amount of million  an enhanced field incentive plan to stimulate domestic sales growth in the amount of million  increased employee health related benefits of million  an increase in bank service charges of million and increased remote server hosting costs to support our business process management  or bpm  system of million 
in addition  throughout fiscal a number of management personnel were replaced and some positions eliminated both domestically and internationally  which led to severance costs for the departed employees in the amount of million 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased or million primarily due to higher depreciation associated with portions of our domestic bpm system that have been placed into service 
interest expense interest expense increased slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal lower average borrowings outstanding during the year were offset by higher average interest rates 
income tax provision we record income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result of our positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed our full  domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  which resulted in an increase in net income for fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
no similar reversal was expected or recorded during fiscal the income tax provision recorded during fiscal differs from statutory rates primarily due to federal tax credits we take advantage of  primarily as a result of the wotc program 
liquidity and capital resources we require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
our traditional use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth and during periods where sales are seasonally high 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
we finance our operations primarily through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities declined significantly to million for the fiscal year ended november   compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  net income was the largest significant decline in the source of cash provided from operations as the company incurred a million loss in fiscal compared with million in net income in fiscal collections of accounts receivable was the largest significant source of cash in fiscal providing million in fiscal collections of accounts receivable  however  were down significantly from the million in fiscal accounts receivable from our domestic business provided million  after taking into account bad debt charge offs 
our domestic accounts receivable decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue 
we continued to focus our efforts on collection and were successful in reducing our domestic days sales outstanding  measured by dividing our ending accounts receivable balance by total sales multiplied by the number of days in the fiscal year  dso from days to days 
this reduction in accounts receivable was offset by an increase in our foreign receivables in both their local currency and as a result of the decline of the us dollar 
australia and the united kingdom both saw significant increases in their dso 
our australian business saw their dso in local currency increase from days to days 
this was a result of several new accounts that had day terms and issues with local branch collection efforts 
our united kingdom receivables  which represent less than of total accounts receivable  increased significantly in their local currency from to days 
much of the increase occurred because a key employee involved in the collection process was on leave during fiscal year additionally  many customers have transitioned to managed accounts which are typically slower pay 
our consolidated dso for fiscal was days compared to days 
we continue our efforts to focus on reducing our dso and believe that we will be successful in reducing dso both domestically and international in fiscal cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures  which is primarily for bpm system initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  was million of this amount during fiscal we continue to invest in enhancements and upgrades to our computer based technologies 
during fiscal  we entered into a license agreement for a domestic bpm system which is being implemented in three phases 
the initial phase  which consisted of the human resources system for regular westaff employees  was successfully implemented in july the second phase  which includes the core financial systems and the accounts payable module  went live in the beginning of fiscal year the final phase  which includes fully integrated front office functionality along with payroll and billing for temporary associates was placed in service in the first quarter of capital expenditures associated with this system implementation were approximately million during fiscal year in addition  we made certain technology infrastructure upgrades in our australian operation during fiscal and implemented a new front office system in our united kingdom operation in the second quarter of fiscal our current credit agreement currently allows up to a maximum of million in capital expenditures for fiscal year the major decrease in cash used for investing activities was the result of an acquisition of a westaff franchise location in houston  texas in fiscal for the terms and conditions of the preexisting relationship were consistent with other relationships we have with other franchisees  and accordingly no settlement gain or loss was recorded 
the transaction resulted in us recording million of franchise rights  million of non compete agreements  and million of goodwill 
we have generated cash in the past through sales of company owned offices to franchise owners or sales of franchise agent and license offices back to the franchise agent or license owner 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold one of our franchise agents operations back to the franchise agent for cash proceeds of million 
we secured the franchise agents note payable obligation to the bank that funded the purchase through a million letter of credit that declines as the note obligation is paid by the franchise agent 
as of november   the balance on the letter of credit was million 
the original terms of the bank note provided for full repayment on december  the company made a demand for a return of the letter of credit which was cancelled in the first quarter of fiscal the million gain on the sale of the franchise operations was originally deferred because of our guaranty arrangement 
the unrecognized gain will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal cash provided from financing activities was million in fiscal compared to amounts used in financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal we increased our net borrowings under the ge capital credit facility by million as a result of our net increase in accounts receivable  while our decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal provided excess funds that allowed us to have a net reduction under our ge capital credit facility of million 
in may  we entered into agreements with ge capital  as primary agent  to provide senior secured multicurrency credit facilities that originally expired in may the credit facility comprised a five year syndicated credit agreement the multicurrency credit agreement consisting of a million us revolving loan commitment  a million uk revolving loan commitment uk dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the agreement  and a million term loan  which was repaid during fiscal in addition  a five year australian dollar facility agreement the a facility agreement was executed on may   consisting of an a million revolving credit facility us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the a facility agreement 
in march  we and our lenders executed an eighth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement 
among other things  the amendment reset minimum ebitda covenants for fiscal and beyond  adjusted the fixed charge coverage ratio for our second quarter of fiscal  extended the credit facility for one additional year to may and added an additional pricing grid that will allow us to benefit from reduced interest rates and letter of credit fees upon achieving certain minimum ebitda targets 
additionally  the amendment increased the maximum amount of the us revolving loan commitment by million to million and increased the letter of credit sub limit from million to million 
in july  we and our lenders executed a ninth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement for the purpose of determining the financial covenants 
the amendment allows for a one time add back adjustment of approximately million to ebitda commencing the fiscal quarter ending april   for the separation and transition charges related to the termination of employment for two of our former executives 
on january   we and our lenders executed a tenth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement 
among other things  this amendment reduces the interest rates if certain financial benchmarks are achieved and resets the future minimum ebitda covenants 
the amendment extended the credit facility for one additional year to may we were not in compliance with its minimum ebitda covenant as of the end of fiscal  and the amendment included a waiver of this covenant violation 
on january   we and our lenders executed an amendment to the a facility agreement  which extended the agreement for two additional years to may on may   we and our lenders executed an th amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement 
the expansion of the board of directors on may  from four to nine constituted a change of control as defined by the multicurrency credit agreement which by operation of the agreement constituted a default event 
the amendment waived the default and waived the ebidta covenant for the quarter ended april  as of november   our total borrowing capacity was million consisting of million for the domestic operations million for australia and million for the united kingdom 
our credit facilities with ge capital as amended  required a minimum adjusted ebitda of million for the trailing periods and a minimum fixed charge ratio of 
we failed to meet the ebitda requirement at the end of our fiscal quarter ended july  and failed the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing fiscal periods ended august  and september  we entered into a day forbearance agreement  limited waiver and consent of guarantors forbearance agreement with ge capital  on october   which required us to maintain a minimum borrowing availability no less than million for more than two consecutive business days for the first days from the date of the forbearance agreement 
following the initial day period and continuing until february  forbearance period  the company is required to maintain a ten business day rolling average borrowing availability of at least million  which is measured every seven days 
the forbearance agreement also waived both the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during the forbearance period and the ebitda requirement  however  the company is required to meet a minimum ebitda of million for fiscal as defined in the ge capital credit agreement 
at fiscal year end  we met the initial borrowing availability test required during the initial days 
we achieved the minimum ebitda million requirement under the forbearance agreement 
our borrowing availability as calculated under the agreement fluctuates based on a number of business conditions and factors 
we failed to meet the million minimum availability requirement contained in the forbearance agreement for four testing periods 
the dates and the amounts by which we failed to achieve the requirement are noted below date of test availability amount per agreement in thousands amount of shortfall to covenant in thousands january   january   january    january    we have had preliminary discussions with ge capital regarding obtaining a waiver from our forbearance events of default availability test requirements as previously noted  as well as in pursuing alternative financing arrangements  upon the expiration of our forbearance agreement on february  although no written communications have been exchanged by either party in this matter  the extension of such forbearance is subject to negotiation  which includes the possibility of additional fees and covenant requirements 
the specific terms of such extension would be subject to negotiation with ge capital 
at the date of termination of the forbearance agreement  and assuming no extension had been agreed  ge capital could proceed to exercise any and all of their respective rights and default related remedies  as specified under the credit agreement 
such remedies include the right to cancel our standby letters of credit that secure our workers compensation obligations and limit our ability to continue borrowing funds pursuant to the credit facility 
in addition  ge capital can require immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts borrowed under the revolving credit line 
we have also been engaged in active negotiations with another large financial institution abl lender to refinance the existing multi currency agreement with similar limits and collateralization 
we entered into a term sheet in late with this abl lender and have made significant progress in working through loan documents 
we have agreed in principle to the major terms of the agreement  and anticipate closing such arrangement in february of we have an unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to our former principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors in the amount of million with an original maturity date of august   and an interest rate equal to an indexed rate as calculated under our credit facilities plus seven percent at november   compounded monthly and payable calendar days after the end of each of our fiscal quarters 
payment of interest is contingent on us meeting minimum availability requirements under our credit facilities 
additionally  payments of principal or interest are prohibited in the event of any default under the credit facilities 
following our default at the end of third quarter fiscal ge capital elected to prohibit the repayment of the note at its maturity and has denied our request to pay quarterly interest 
interest expense on this note for fiscal was million of which million was accrued but unpaid at year end 
the company believes its initiatives in will allow it meet the required covenants after the forbearance period and continues to show the unpaid note as a current liability on the balance sheet 
in february  we completed the sale of our former corporate headquarters building for cash proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we have an outstanding million irrevocable standby letter of credit as a security deposit for the december sale leaseback of the land and buildings housing our administrative offices 
we work to balance our worldwide cash needs through dividends from and loans to our international subsidiaries 
these loans and dividends are limited by the cash availability and needs of each respective subsidiary  restrictions imposed by our senior secured debt facilities and  in some cases  statutory regulations of the subsidiary 
the us operations cannot directly draw on the excess borrowing availability of the uk or australian operations  however  we may request dividends from the uk the uk can also request repayments on its intercompany loan to australia  along with intercompany interest and royalties  although remittances from australia may be limited by certain covenants under the terms of the australia credit facility 
outstanding principal on the intercompany loan to australia was million as of november  and million as of october  we are responsible for and pay workers compensation costs for our domestic temporary and regular employees and are self insured for the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims to a limit of  per claim for fiscal years  and generally speaking  each policy year the terms of the agreement with the insurance carrier are renegotiated 
the insurance carrier requires us to collateralize our obligations through the use of irrevocable standby letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
in november  our insurance carrier reduced our collateral requirements by reducing the requirement for standby letters of credit from million to million 
under the terms of our policy year agreement  we made cash premium payments totaling million  paid in equal monthly installments  which commenced on november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we and our insurance carrier negotiated the return of million of the fiscal cash collateral and we issued million of letters of credit in its place 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we issued an additional million of letters of credit in exchange for million in cash  which represented all of the cash remaining in the collateral fund 
for our policy year insurance program  we anticipate total cash premium payments of million will be paid during fiscal in equal monthly installments  which commenced on november  cash payments for policy year claims will be paid directly by us up to our deductible which was increased from  per claim to  per claim for fiscal as of january  we had outstanding million of letters of credit to secure all estimated outstanding obligations under our workers compensation program for all years except  which is fully funded although subject to annual retroactive premium adjustments based on actual claims activity 
we will also make ongoing cash payments for claims for all other open policy years except for as noted above 
we calculate the estimated liabilities associated with these programs based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers  insurers and actuary  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure for each of these programs 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
we continue to evaluate other opportunities to further strengthen our financial position 
however  we believe that if we are able to complete our proposed financing transaction it will provide us with sufficient borrowing capacity  together with cash generated through our operating performance  to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations in future fiscal year in millions as of november  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than one fiscal year to fiscal years to fiscal years more than fiscal years credit facilities promissory note operating leases workers compensation policy year capital leases principal capital leases interest total contractual obligations the credit agreement expires in may  but our lenders could require accelerated payment of amounts outstanding under the credit facilities in the event of default on on one or more of the debt covenants contained therein payments under the promissory note are subject to certain restrictions regarding borrowing capacity and compliance within our senior secured credit facilities workers compensation obligations for policy year reflect the minimum amount due for premiums only 
we self insure for workers compensation and pay claims as incurred item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at november  our outstanding debt under variable rate interest borrowings was approximately million 
a change of two percentage points in the interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant with respect to interest income  as our investment portfolio is not material to our consolidated balance sheet 
we currently have no plans to hold an investment portfolio that includes derivative financial instruments 
for the fiscal year ended november   our international operations comprised of our revenue and  as of the end of that period  of our total assets 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our multicurrency credit facility  which allows our australian and united kingdom subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies  partially mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency denominated net investments in these subsidiaries in relation to the us dollar 
we do not currently hold any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for hedging transaction risks related to foreign currencies 
in addition  we have not entered into any transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
