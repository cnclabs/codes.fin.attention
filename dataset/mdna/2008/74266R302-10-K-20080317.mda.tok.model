overview we are an international provider of adult media content 
we acquire still photography and motion pictures from independent directors and process these images into products suitable for popular media formats such as print publications  dvds and digital media content for broadcasting  mobile and internet distribution 
in addition to media content  we also market and distribute branded leisure and novelty products oriented to the adult entertainment lifestyle and generate additional sales through the licensing of our private trademark to third parties 
in june  we acquired milcap media limited  its subsidiaries and cine craft 
prior to these acquisitions  we were a holding company 
milcap media limited  its subsidiaries and cine craft were the acquirees  but for accounting purposes they were deemed to be the acquirors 
we became a us reporting company following the acquisitions 
we operate in a highly competitive  service oriented market and are subject to changes in business  economic and competitive conditions 
nearly all of our products compete with other products and services that utilize adult leisure time and disposable income 
we generate revenues primarily through sales of movies on dvd  sales of adult feature magazines  internet subscriptions and licensing  broadcasting movies through iptv internet protocol television  cable  satellite and hotel television programming  sales of adult mobile content wireless  and content  brand name and trademark licensing 
the following table illustrates our net sales by product group for the periods indicated 
years ended december  eur eur eur in thousands net sales by product group dvds magazines internet broadcasting wireless total over time  we expect net sales from dvds magazines to continue to decline as a percentage of net sales in relation to total net sales from internet  broadcasting and wireless 
we expect net sales from internet  wireless and broadcasting to grow during the coming years 
we recognize net sales on delivery for further information  see critical accounting estimates 
even though we recognize net sales upon delivery  we generally provide extended payment terms to our distributors of between and days 
although our extended payment terms increase our exposure to accounts receivable write offs  we believe our risk is minimized by our generally long term relationships with our distributors 
in addition  we view our extended payment terms as an investment in our distribution channels which are important to the growth of our business 
our primary expenses include acquisition of content for our library of photographs and videos  printing  processing and duplication costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our magazines and dvd covers are printed by independent third party printers in spain 
we introduced dvds as a motion picture medium in the production of each dvd master disc  prior to duplication  costs approximately  dvds have a relatively low cost of duplication  inclusive of box and packaging  of approximately per unit 
our dvds are duplicated on an all region format  playable on both ntsc and pal with multiple languages and sub titles 
we released titles on dvd during  titles on dvd during and titles during  including both new and archival material 
we plan to release approximately proprietary titles on dvds in over the years  our cost of sales has been fluctuating relative to net sales due to our use of new mediums for our products  such as the internet  dvd broadcasting and wireless 
internet  wireless and broadcasting sales has historically not carried any cost of sales and variations in these areas affect the overall cost of sales percentage in relation to sales 
these new media provide us with additional sales of our existing content we also incur significant intangible expenses in connection with the amortization of our library of photographs and movies and capitalized development costs  which include the internet 
we amortize these tangible and intangible assets on a straight line basis for periods of between three and five years 
critical accounting estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of the library of photographs and videos and other long lived assets  allowances for bad debt  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
accounts receivable and sales related to certain products are  in accordance with industry practice  subject to distributors right of return to unsold items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management periodically reviews such estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of unexpected changes in trends 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue the company sells magazines to wholesalers on firm sale basis and via national newsstand distributors with the right to return 
our magazines are multi lingual and the principal magazine market is in europe 
revenues from the sale of magazines under agreements that grant distributors rights of return are recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs on delivery  net of an allowance for returned magazines 
distributors with the right to return are primarily national newsstand distributors 
most of our magazines are bi monthly six issues per year and remain on sale at a newsstand for a period of two months 
normally  all unsolds are reported to us within a period of four to six months from delivery 
there are normally two to four national newsstand distributors for all newspapers and periodicals operating in each country 
a majority of our national newsstand distributors are members of distripress  the international organization for publishers and distributors  and carry out the distribution of the largest national and international newspapers and periodicals  including financial times  herald tribune  time  newsweek  vogue  etc 
the company uses specific return percentages per title and distributor based on estimates and historical data 
the percentages vary from 
higher percentages generally reflect newer markets and or products 
percentages are reviewed on an on going basis 
the magazines have an approximate retail price of eur usd per copy and are printed on glossy high quality paper at a cost of eur usd 
they are often shrink wrapped in order to comply with local regulation or guidance for the sale of adult publications 
in view of the high retail price  the margin and the physical quality of the magazines and the fact that the content has a very long shelf life since it is not particularly linked to time  trends  fashion or current events  the company has always collected the returns from newsstands in order to make them available for sale again 
the company has scheduled re distribution of the returned magazines  via national newsstand distributors  as megapacks or superpacks three different copies per pack where the retail price is eur usd 
as the national newsstand distributors have the right to return  the packs come back to us and are then broken up in individual copies in order to be sent out in dvd packs  see below  or sold on firm sale basis to wholesalers as back numbers at a lower price than new issues 
the company also operates scheduled re distribution of returned magazines  via national newsstand distributors  together with dvds as magazine dvd packs as a way of increasing dvd distribution 
since the national newsstand distributors have the right to return  the dvd packs are returned and the magazines are broken out in order to be sold on firm sale basis to wholesalers as back numbers at a lower price than new issues 
the company has historically sold all copies printed at an average price higher than  or equal  to cost 
revenues from the sale of dvd products under consignment agreements with distributors are recognized based upon reported sales by the company s distributors 
revenues from the sale of subscriptions to the company s internet website are deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
revenues from licensing of broadcasting rights to the company s video and film library are recognized upon delivery when the following conditions have been met i license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation  exhibition  or sale ii the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and iii collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
revenues from iptv internet protocol television  satellite cable broadcasting are recognized based on sales reported each month by its iptv  cable and satellite affiliates 
the affiliates do not report actual monthly sales for each of their systems to the company until approximately days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
revenues from mobile content sales wireless are recognized based on sales reported each month by mobile operators via aggregators 
the aggregators do not report actual monthly sales for each of their operators to the company until approximately days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in the past and may occur in the future due to the current market environment 
management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the balance based on their estimate of the collectibility of specific accounts as well as a reserve for a portion of other accounts which have been outstanding for more than days 
this estimate is based on historical losses and information about specific customers 
after collection attempts have failed  the company writes off the specific account 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january  the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
during  the company performed an initial impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  this generally required us to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of these assets 
there was no effect of on the earnings and financial position of the company as a result of the impairment testing 
other intangible assets represents the value attributable to certain acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization expense is calculated on a straight line basis over years 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets including its library of photographs and videos for potential impairment 
upon indication of impairment  the company will record a loss on its long lived assets if the undiscounted cash flows that are estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the related carrying value of the assets 
an impairment loss is then measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated discounted future cash flows 
management s estimated future revenues are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions and additional write downs may be required if actual conditions are less favorable than those assumed 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost principally determined on an average basis 
inventories principally consist of dvd s  videocassettes and magazines held for sale or resale 
the inventory is written down to the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required by eur million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and were never a party to any derivative  swap or option contracts 
we do not hedge our interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
as our cash and cash equivalent and short term investments consist principally of money market securities and investments in short term debt or equity securities and our borrowings are primarily at fixed rates of interest our market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates is limited 
accordingly  a one percentage change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we transact our business in various currencies  principally the euro and the u 
s dollar and certain other european union currencies 
we generally attempt to limit exposure to currency rate fluctuations by matching transaction currencies revenues expenses to the functional currency of its operating subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to fluctuations in the euro versus the u 
s dollar 
we translate our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro into the euro for reporting purposes 
income statement amounts are translated into euros using the average exchange rate for the fiscal year 
the balance sheet is translated at the year end exchange rate 
due to the significance of the results reported in dollars the impact of the euro dollar exchange rate on our major categories of revenue and expense can be material
