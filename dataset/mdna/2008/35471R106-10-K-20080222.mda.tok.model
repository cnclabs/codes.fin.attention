overview fsp corp 
or the company  operates in two business segments real estate operations and investment banking investment services 
the real estate operations segment involves real estate rental operations  leasing  secured financing of real estate for interim acquisition or other property financing  and services provided for asset management  property management  property acquisitions  dispositions and development 
the investment banking investment services segment involves the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that include the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in private placements 
the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states 
these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level 
we have no influence on the national market conditions 
we look to acquire and or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur 
our investment banking investment services customers are primarily institutions and high net worth individuals 
to the extent that the broad capital markets affect these investors our business is also affected 
these investors have many investment choices 
we must continually search for real estate at a price and at a competitive risk reward rate of return that meets our customer s risk reward profile for providing a stream of income and as a long term hedge against inflation 
trends and uncertainties debt market conditions because interest rate levels and the availability of financing may affect real estate values  occupancy levels  property income and the propensity and the ability of investors to invest in sponsored reits  debt market conditions could affect our business 
the debt market is currently experiencing unprecedented disruptions  including reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for certain market participants 
these conditions  which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt  may continue or worsen in the future 
at this time we cannot predict the extent or duration of any negative impact that the current debt market conditions will have on our business 
real estate operations our real estate portfolio was approximately leased as of december   as compared to leased as of december  and leased as of september  two major leases accounted for most of the increase from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter of approximately  square feet of space at our property in silicon valley that we had renovated and repositioned during was leased 
the other major lease was for approximately  square feet at one of our greater denver properties 
our other repositioned property in the greater seattle tacoma area has been slower to lease and remains substantially vacant  however  we believe that this property will continue to lease up over time  if market conditions remain favorable 
the gains from new leasing activity in were partially offset by the termination of one lease to a subprime lender in the greater atlanta market 
at this time we cannot predict whether the current debt market conditions will have a negative impact on the financial strength of our existing tenants 
accordingly  we have been closely monitoring those tenants in the mortgage lending  development and related industries 
as of december   approximately of our total square footage was leased to tenants in the mortgage lending industry and we have taken that credit risk into account in reviewing our reserve for bad debts 
while we cannot predict when existing vacancy will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be  we expect to renew or sign new leases at current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located  which in some cases may be below the expiring rental rates 
we ended with strong leasing activity in most of our markets but we have not seen a similar level of activity so far in the beginning of it is possible that the current debt market conditions and related uncertainty in the greater capital markets will have a negative impact on leasing activity for at least a portion of investment banking investment services unlike our real estate operations business  which provides a rental revenue stream which is ongoing and recurring in nature  our investment banking investment services business is transactional in nature 
equity raised for sponsored reit syndications for decreased to million compared to million in business in this area  while always uncertain  was adversely affected in the third and fourth quarter of by the recent turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets 
investors that have historically participated in our private placement real estate offerings continue to express uncertainty about investing in this environment 
consequently  equity amounts raised by our investment executives in the third and fourth quarter of dropped significantly from approximately million achieved in the first half of to approximately million achieved in the second half of at this point  it is unclear when a more visible market environment will return for our investment banking business 
in january  one of our sponsored reits purchased an office property located in chicago  illinois for investment syndication 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement preferred stock offering totaling million 
this offering was the largest single investment syndication in our history  and was fully subscribed in the fourth quarter of we purchased a total of shares of preferred stock of this sponsored reit at a net cost of million 
the balance of the offering was subscribed primarily by institutions and high net worth individuals  our traditional customer base 
during september  another sponsored reit commenced syndication on an office property located in kansas city  missouri 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement preferred stock offering totaling million  which is ongoing as of the beginning of notwithstanding our current syndication in kansas city  missouri  our property acquisition executives are now grappling with greater uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for prime commercial investment real estate 
we believe that the current turmoil in the debt markets  as well as perceptions about the future us economy and interest rates  are producing a larger than normal divergence in the perception of value and future relative investment performance of commercial properties 
while we generally believe that such an environment has the potential to produce some exceptional property acquisition opportunities  caution  perspective and disciplined underwriting standards can significantly impact the timing of any future acquisitions 
consequently  our ability to provide a regular stream of real estate investment product necessary to grow our overall investment banking investment services business is uncertain as begins 
we also continue to rely solely on our in house investment executives to access interested investors who have capital they can afford to place in an illiquid position for an indefinite period of time ie  invest in a sponsored reit 
we continue to evaluate whether our in house sales force is capable  either through our existing client base or through new clients  of raising sufficient investment capital in sponsored reits to achieve future performance objectives 
discontinued operations and property dispositions during the year ended december   the company disposed of five office properties 
the five office properties are located in greenville  south carolina  alpharetta  georgia  san diego  california  westford  massachusetts and austin  texas 
during the year ended december   the company disposed of one apartment property and five commercial properties 
the apartment property is located in katy  texas 
the five commercial properties are located in santa clara  california  fairfax and herndon  virginia and north andover and peabody  massachusetts 
during the year ended december   the company disposed of three apartment properties and three commercial properties 
the three apartment properties included two that are located in houston  texas  and one in baton rouge  louisiana 
the three commercial properties are located in folsom  california  columbia  maryland and san diego  california 
accordingly  sold properties as of december  and are classified as held for sale on our financial statements 
the operating results for these real estate assets have been reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the years ended december   and we continue to evaluate our portfolio  and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
however  because of the current uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for real estate and the current uncertainty in the capital and debt markets previously discussed  we do not expect the level of disposition activity to be as significant as the prior three years 
critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations  and that require significant management estimates and judgments  are discussed below 
critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in sponsored reits and our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on our recognition of rental income and depreciation and amortization expense  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets  classification of leases  and revenue recognition in the syndication of sponsored reits 
allocation of purchase price we have historically allocated the purchase prices of properties to land  buildings and improvements 
each component of purchase price generally has a different useful life 
for properties acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among land  buildings  improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of tenant relationships 
purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates 
under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations 
purchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant 
management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
purchase price allocated to above market leases is based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
purchase price allocated to in place leases and tenant relationships is determined as the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include i an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  including real estate taxes  insurance and other operating income and expenses  and ii costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
if future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
depreciation expense we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
costs incurred in connection with leasing primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the lease period 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
the value of above or below market leases is amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income 
the value of in place leases  exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases  is also amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs  or incorrect estimates of useful lives  could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods  as is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
impairment we periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include declining tenant occupancy  weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative  economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
lease classification some of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
revenue recognition we earn syndication and transaction fees in connection with the syndication of sponsored reits 
this revenue is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  and statement of position accounting for real estate syndication income 
revenue is recognized provided the criteria for sale accounting in sfas no 
are met 
accordingly  we recognize syndication fees related to commissions when shares of the sponsored reit are sold and the investor s funds have been transferred from escrow into our account 
we recognize transaction fees related to loan commitment and acquisition fees upon an investor closing and the subsequent payment of the sponsored reit s loan and fees payable to us 
other transaction fees are recognized upon the final closing of the syndication of the sponsored reit 
ownership of stock in a sponsored reit common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by the company 
following the commencement of syndication the company exercises influence over  but does not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
once under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses or dividends received from sponsored reits generally are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there is an asset held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we recognize our share of the operations during the period we consolidate and when the equity method is appropriate  as opposed to classifying the sponsored reits as discontinued operations  because we earn an ongoing asset and or property management fee from sponsored reits 
these ongoing fees  in addition to the influence that we exercise over the sponsored reit  constitute a continuing involvement between the company and the sponsored reit and preclude treatment as discontinued operations 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in three sponsored reits 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in these three sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us  current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located 
competition  economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future 
in the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
recent accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flow 
results of operations overview during we acquired the four target reits by merger  acquired two additional properties and sold six properties

the results of operations for each of the acquired or merged properties are included in our operating results as of their respective purchase or merger dates 
increases in rental revenues and expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   or  the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are primarily a result of the timing of these acquisitions and subsequent contribution of these acquired properties

the operating results of the seventeen properties sold in  and are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
investment banking revenue for the investment banking investment services segment is primarily based on the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in the syndications of the sponsored reits 
we completed the syndication of three sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in and two sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in the million increase in compared to reversed a trend of declines  which had been attributable to difficulty in finding properties that met our investment criteria 
during we completed one syndication of a sponsored reit and are in the process of syndicating another sponsored reit  for which total gross proceeds from both syndications aggregated million in we believe the decrease of million in compared to was attributable to the recent turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets  which is discussed above in trends and uncertainties 
revenues and expenses for investment banking investment services are directly related to the gross proceeds of these syndications 
our acquisition executives continue to work on other property investment opportunities 
however  our investment banking business was negatively impacted by the turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets that began in the third quarter of business growth in this area is uncertain at the beginning of the following table shows financial results for the years ended december  and in thousands revenue change rental related party revenue syndication fees transaction fees management fees and interest income from loans other total revenue expenses real estate operating expenses real estate taxes and insurance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative commissions interest total expenses income before interest income  equity in earnings deficits of non consolidated reits and taxes on income interest income equity in earnings deficit of non consolidated reits income before taxes on income taxes on income income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations income before gain on sale of properties gain on sale of properties net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o an increase to rental revenue of approximately million from real estate arising from the acquisitions of the following properties a property in texas during february  the five target reits by merger on april   a property in georgia in june  a property in colorado in december and a property in maryland in june the increase was net of a million decrease in lease termination payments received 
during the year ended december  we received lease termination fee income of  compared to approximately million received from three tenants during the year ended december  o an increase in management fees and interest income from loans of approximately million  which was principally a result of interest income from larger average loan balances during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in for the mortgage loans on the properties in syndication

this decrease of million is attributable to million provided by operating activities less million used by investing activities and million used for financing activities 
presentation of our consolidated statements of cash flows combines cash flows from continuing operations with those of discontinued operations 
where significant  cash flows from discontinued operations are discussed below 
management believes that existing cash  cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations  cash anticipated to be generated by the sale of preferred stock in future sponsored reits and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
operating activities the cash provided by our operating activities of million  which includes million of discontinued operations from sales of real estate assets  is primarily attributable to net income of million excluding non cash activity  consisting primarily of the gain on sale of real estate assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million  plus equity in the loss from non consolidated reits of million  plus dividends received from non consolidated reits of million  less payment of deferred leasing commissions of approximately million and net uses arising from changes in current assets and current liabilities of million 
investing activities our cash used by investing activities of million is attributable to the proceeds from sale of properties of million  plus redemption of an investment in a certificate of deposit of million  less uses of million for acquisitions and additions to real estate investments and office equipment  which includes million in additions made to properties sold during  less an investment in non consolidated reits of million  and less an investment in an asset held for syndication of million 
financing activities our cash used by financing activities of million is attributable to approximately million of distributions to shareholders and the purchase of our company s shares of million less proceeds from borrowings under our bank note payable of million 
line of credit we have a revolving line of credit agreement with a group of banks providing for borrowings of up to million 
on october   we amended the loan agreement that evidences and secures our revolving line of credit to  among other things  increase the amount of borrowings available to use from  to  and to extend the maturity date from august to august borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at either the bank s prime rate at december  or a rate equal to day libor plus basis points at december  
there were borrowings of  at the day libor plus basis point rate at a weighted average rate of outstanding under the line of credit at december  we are in compliance with all bank covenants required by the line of credit 
we have drawn on this line of credit  and intend to draw on this line of credit in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the funding of interim mortgage loans to sponsored reits and the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio 
we typically cause mortgage loans to sponsored reits to be secured by a first mortgage against the real property owned by the sponsored reit 
we make these loans to enable a sponsored reit to acquire real property prior to the consummation of the offering of its equity interests  and the loan is repaid out of the offering proceeds 
we also may make secured loans to sponsored reits for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and other costs which would be repaid from long term financing of the property  cash flows from the property or a capital event 
contingencies from time to time  we may provide financing to sponsored reits in the form of a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage 
as of december   we were committed to fund up to million to one sponsored reit under such an arrangement for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and leasing costs  however no amounts have been drawn 
we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

as part of the syndication of fsp east wacker drive corp  we purchased the final shares of its preferred stock for approximately million on december   representing approximately a interest 
in december  we entered into a secured promissory note for a revolving line of credit  which we refer to as the revolver  for up to million with a sponsored reit  fsp highland place i corp  which is available but has not been drawn on 
advances under the revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points 
the revolver was made for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and other costs of leasing

for a discussion of transactions between us and related parties during  see footnote no 
related party transactions to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  other considerations we generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties 
for the years ending december  and  the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property  with the exception of a property located in westford  massachusetts  which we sold on july   a property located in federal way  washington  a property located in san jose  california and a property located in santa clara  california that was sold on may  the westford  massachusetts property had operating expenses of approximately  the six and one half month period ending through july  on which date the property was sold and  for the year ended december  the property located in santa clara  california had operating expenses of  for the five month period ending through may  on which date the property was sold 
the single tenant lease at the property located in federal way  washington  expired september  during we signed leases with two tenants for approximately of the space  which generated rental income of  during the year ended december  we expect that the property will not produce revenue to cover its expenses in the first quarter of the property had operating expenses of  for the year ended december  the single tenant lease at the property located in san jose  california  expired december  there is one tenant in the building occupying approximately of the rentable square feet of the property 
in december we signed a lease that will commence in with another tenant for approximately of the rentable square feet of the property 
we had rental income of  during the year ended december  from the tenant in place and the property had operating expenses of  for the year ended december  we are completing tenant improvements and a repositioning of the property and  as a result  we believe that the property will produce revenue to cover its expenses starting in the first quarter of rental income commitments our commercial real estate operations include the leasing of office buildings and industrial properties subject to leases with terms greater than one year 
the leases thereon expire at various dates through approximate future minimum rental income from non cancelable operating leases as of december  is in thousands year ended december  thereafter contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual in thousands obligations total line of credit operating leases total the operating leases in the table above consist of our lease of corporate office space  which was amended in  expires on july  and has one year renewal option

from time to time  we may provide financing to sponsored reits in the form of a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage 
as of december   we were committed to fund up to million to one sponsored reit under such an arrangement for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and leasing costs  however no amounts have been drawn 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in sponsored reits as part of our business model we organize single purpose entities that own real estate  purchases of which are financed through the private placement of equity in those entities  typically through syndication 
we call these entities sponsored reits  and they are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts 
we earn fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the sponsored reits in these syndications 
the sponsored reits issue both common stock and preferred stock 
the common stock is owned solely by fsp corp 
generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors  however  we acquired an interest in preferred shares of four sponsored reits 
in addition  directors and officers of fsp corp  have from time to time invested in sponsored reits and may do so again in the future 
following consummation of the offerings  the preferred stockholders in each of the sponsored reits are entitled to of the sponsored reit s cash distributions 
subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  except for the preferred stock we own  we do not share in any of the sponsored reit s earnings  or any related dividend  and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk 
prior to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  we share in a sponsored reit s earnings and related dividends to the extent of our ownership interest in the sponsored reit 
as a common stockholder  upon completion of the syndication  we have no rights to the sponsored reit s earnings or any related cash distributions 
however  upon liquidation of a sponsored reit  we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment 
our percentage interest in each sponsored reit is less than 
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the sponsored reit s preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger  sale of property  amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock 
in addition  all of the sponsored reits allow the holders of more than of the outstanding preferred shares to remove without cause and replace one or more members of that sponsored reit s board of directors 
common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by us 
following the commencement of syndication we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  the cost basis is increased by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative and distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there are assets held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in four sponsored reits  including one that the company acquired by merger on april   which was accounted for as a purchase  and the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair value 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in the remaining three sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  of which were fully syndicated and from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
one syndication commenced in september and was not completed by december  the value of the entity that was not fully syndicated was approximately million and was shown on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset held for syndication 
at december   we held a common stock interest in ten sponsored reits  nine of which were fully syndicated  and one was substantially syndicated  from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  all of which were fully syndicated and from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
the table below shows our income and expenses from sponsored reits 
management fees of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and interest expense related to the company s mortgage on properties is eliminated in consolidation 
year ended december  in thousands operating data rental revenues operating and maintenance expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense permanent mortgage loan interest expense acquisition loan interest income during the year ended december   we recorded equity in losses from two sponsored reits following the commencement of syndication of  and during the years ended december  and we recorded equity in earnings of sponsored reits following the commencement of syndication of  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at or during the year ended december  market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
our line of credit matures in august and has a variable rate of interest 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
we borrow from time to time on our line of credit 
these borrowings bear interest at the bank s base rate at december  or at day libor plus basis points at december   as elected by us when requesting funds as defined 
generally the borrowings are for day libor plus basis points 
as of december   we had two borrowings totaling  in the aggregate at the day libor plus basis point rate  representing a weighted average rate of  outstanding under the line of credit 
at december  there were no amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
we have drawn on this line of credit  and intend to draw on this line of credit in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the funding of interim mortgage loans to sponsored reits and the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio 
generally interim mortgage loans bear interest at the same variable rate payable by us under our line of credit 
we also may draw on this line of credit to fund advances we may make under a million revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolver that we provided to a sponsored reit  fsp highland place i corp 
in december  which has not yet been drawn on 
advances under the revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points 
we therefore believe that we have mitigated our interest rate risk with respect to our borrowings for both interim mortgage and revolver loans 
historically we have satisfied obligations arising from interim or other financing of acquisitions through cash or sale of properties in our portfolio 
we believe that we can mitigate interest rate risk with respect to borrowings for interim or other financing of acquisitions as well 
the following table presents as of december  our contractual variable rate borrowings under the line of credit  which matures august payment due by period in thousands total after line of credit total if market rates of our line of credit borrowings at maturity increased by  or approximately basis points  over the current variable rate  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million annually 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our variable rate borrowings is material as of december
