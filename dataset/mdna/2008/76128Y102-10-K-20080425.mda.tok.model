this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents key financial measures in evaluating the results of operations  our management refers to a number of key financial and non financial measures relating to the performance of our business segments 
among our key financial measures are net sales  operating profit  and net income 
non financial measures that we use in evaluating our performance include number of stores  leased operations  net sales per average gross square foot for our stores and change in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year 
for fiscal and prior years  we considered comparable store sales to be sales at stores that were open months as of the prior fiscal year end 
comparable store sales are also referred to as comp store sales by others within the retail industry 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our calculation of comparable store sales may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the company s revenues are generated through sales from existing stores and through sales from new stores 
in fiscal  dsw opened new stores and closed one store  and filene s basement opened seven new stores and closed two stores 
for fiscal  filene s basement plans to open at least one new store and dsw plans to open at least additional stores 
during fiscal  filene s basement ceased operations in two stores temporarily due to remodeling  one of which reopened in fiscal while the other is not expected to reopen until fiscal critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from merchandise sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of returns and exclude sales tax 
revenue from gift cards is deferred and the revenue is recognized upon redemption of the gift card 
our policy is to recognize income from breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is remote 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we had accumulated enough historical data to recognize income from gift card breakage 
we recognized million as miscellaneous income from gift card breakage in fiscal prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had not recognized any income from gift card breakage 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the realizable value  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of 
table of contents markdowns 
accordingly  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
reserves to value inventory at its realizable value were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including setting the original merchandise retail value known as markon  markups of initial prices established  reduction of pricing due to customers perceived value known as markdowns and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  and the resulting gross margins 
investments 
investments  which include demand notes and auction rate securities  are classified as available for sale securities 
these demand notes and auction rate securities are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every to days 
all income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income 
dsw records an investment impairment charge at the point it is believed an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an impairment has occurred  dsw reviews information about the underlying investment that is publicly available and assesses its ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
any other than temporary impairment charge could materially affect dsw s results of operations 
as of february  and february   dsw held million and million  respectively  in short term investments 
as of february   dsw held million in long term investments and held no long term investments as of february  dsw s long term investment balance includes million in auction rate securities that failed at auction after february  and were presented as long term as it is unknown if dsw will be able to liquidate these securities within one year 
asset impairment and long lived assets 
we must periodically evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and finite life intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review to ascertain if any assets have been impaired 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows from the asset 
our reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level which includes a store 
the impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value  based on discounted future cash flows 
should an impairment loss be realized  it will be included in operating expenses 
assets acquired for stores that have been previously impaired are not capitalized when acquired if the store s expected future cash flow remains negative 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million  respectively  related to long lived assets at store operating units 
we believe at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of long lived assets continue to be appropriate 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
store closing reserve 
during the fiscal year  the company recorded charges associated with the closing of one dsw and two filene s basement stores 
during the fiscal year  the company recorded charges associated with the closing of five dsw stores 
the operating lease at one of the five stores was terminated through the exercise of a lease kick out option 
during the first quarter of  the company closed one filene s basement store for which closing costs were accrued during the fourth quarter of fiscal these reserves are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances 
the store closing reserves were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
health and welfare estimates are calculated utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
workers compensation and general liability estimates are calculated  utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
we have purchased stop loss insurance to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per person basis for health and welfare and on a per claim basis for workers compensation and casualty insurance 
although we do not anticipate the amounts ultimately paid will differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
for example  for workers compensation and general liability estimates  a increase or decrease to the assumptions for claims costs and loss development factors would increase or decrease our self insurance by less than million 
the self insurance reserves were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in self insurance reserves was principally associated with the decrease in general liability 

table of contents pension 
the obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at both february  and february   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plan were a discount rate of and long term rate of return on plan assets of 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
dsw maintains a customer loyalty program for the dsw stores in which program members receive a discount on future purchases 
upon reaching the target earned threshold  members receive certificates for these discounts which must be redeemed within six months 
during the third quarter of fiscal dsw re launched its loyalty program  which included changing the name from reward your style to dsw rewards  the points threshold to receive a certificate and the certificate amounts 
the changes were designed to improve customer awareness  customer loyalty and dsw s ability to communicate with its customers 
dsw accrues the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase 
to estimate these costs  dsw is required to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates based on historical experience 
the accrued liability as of february  and february  was million and million  respectively 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 changes in the fair values are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company uses the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of derivative instruments 
for the fiscal years ended february  and february   the company recorded a benefit of million and a charge of million  respectively  related to the change in fair value of warrants 
for the fiscal years ended february  and february   the company recorded a reduction of expenses of million and a charge of million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the conversion feature of the pies 
income taxes 
we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction in which we do business 
in making these estimates  we adjust income based on a determination of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if our management had made these determinations on a different basis  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve of million for state net operating loss carry forwards and wrote off million of deferred tax assets no longer deductible as a result of changes in state income tax laws in ohio

results of operations we operate three business segments 
our filene s basement segment operates full line  off price junior department stores 
our dsw segment is a specialty branded footwear retailer 
as of february   a total filene s basement and dsw stores were open

table of contents seasonality our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses
