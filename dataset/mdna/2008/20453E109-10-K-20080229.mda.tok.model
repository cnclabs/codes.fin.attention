ebitda is included in this annual report on form k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  some of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates by using ebitda 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
management also believes that ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  and ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness 
ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of 
table of contents earnings or of cash flow and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
in addition  it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and  therefore  ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization and minority interest

overview we are a leading provider of specialized services and products focused on helping oil and gas companies develop hydrocarbon reserves  reduce operating costs and enhance production 
we focus on basins within north america that we believe have attractive long term potential for growth  and we deliver targeted  value added services and products required by our customers within each specific basin 
we believe our range of services and products positions us to meet the many needs of our customers at the wellsite  from drilling and completion through production and eventual abandonment 
we manage our operations from regional field service facilities located throughout the us rocky mountain region  texas  oklahoma  louisiana  arkansas  kansas  western canada  mexico and southeast asia 

table of contents on september   we completed the combination see item business the combination of complete energy services  inc ces  integrated production services  inc ips and ie miller services  inc iem pursuant to which the ces and iem shareholders exchanged all of their common stock for common stock of ips 
the combination was accounted for using the continuity of interests method of accounting  which yields results similar to the pooling of interest method 
subsequent to the combination  ips changed its name to complete production services  inc on april   we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is currently trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cpx 
the total offering amount was approximately million  consisting of approximately million in a primary offering less underwriters fees and discounts and approximately million in a secondary offering by selling stockholders 
we operate in three business segments completion and production services 
through our completion and production services segment  we establish  maintain and enhance the flow of oil and gas throughout the life of a well 
this segment is divided into the following primary service lines intervention services 
well intervention requires the use of specialized equipment to perform an array of wellbore services 
our fleet of intervention service equipment includes coiled tubing units  pressure pumping units  nitrogen units  well service rigs  snubbing units and a variety of support equipment 
our intervention services provide customers with innovative solutions to increase production of oil and gas 
downhole and wellsite services 
our downhole and wellsite services include electric line  slickline  production optimization  production testing  rental and fishing services 
we also offer several proprietary services and products that we believe create significant value for our customers 
fluid handling 
we provide a variety of services to help our customers obtain  move  store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the development and production of their reservoirs 
through our fleet of specialized trucks  frac tanks and other assets  we provide fluid transportation  heating  pumping and disposal services for our customers 
drilling services 
through our drilling services segment  we provide services and equipment that initiate or stimulate oil and gas production by providing land drilling  specialized rig logistics and site preparation throughout our service area 
our drilling rigs currently operate exclusively in and around the barnett shale region of north texas 
product sales 
through our product sales segment  we provide a variety of equipment used by oil and gas companies throughout the lifecycle of their wells 
we sell a full range of oilfield supplies  as well as tubular goods  throughout the united states north texas  louisiana  arkansas  oklahoma and the rocky mountains  primarily through our supply stores 
we also sell products through our southeast asia business and through agents in markets outside of north america 
substantially all service and rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a period of time an hour  a day  a week for the actual period of time the service or rental is provided to our customer 
product sales are recorded when the actual sale occurs and title or ownership passes to the customer 
our customers include large multi national and independent oil and gas producers  as well as smaller independent producers and the major land based drilling contractors in north america see customers in item of this annual report on form k 
the primary factor influencing demand for our services and products is the level of drilling and workover activity of our customers  which in turn  depends on current and anticipated future oil and gas prices  production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by our customers to their drilling and workover budgets 
as a result  demand for our services and products is cyclical  substantially depends on activity levels in the north american oil and gas industry and is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
the following tables summarize average north american drilling and well 
table of contents service rig activity  as measured by baker hughes incorporated bhi and the weatherford aesc service rig count for active rigs  respectively  and historical commodity prices as provided by bloomberg average rig counts year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended bhi rotary rig count us land us offshore total us canada total north america source bhi www

we consider the drilling and well service rig counts to be an indication of spending by our customers in the oil and gas industry for exploration and development of new and existing hydrocarbon reserves 
these spending levels are a primary driver of our business  and we believe that our customers tend to invest more in these activities when oil and gas prices are at higher levels or are increasing 
we evaluate the utilization of our assets as a measure of operating performance 
this utilization can be impacted by these and other external and internal factors 
see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents we generally charge for our services on a dayrate basis 
depending on the specific service  a dayrate may include one or more of these components a set up charge  an hourly service rate based on equipment and labor  an equipment rental charge  a consumables charge and a mileage and fuel charge 
we generally determine the rates charged through a competitive process on a job by job basis 
typically  work is performed on a call out basis  whereby the customer requests services on a job specific basis  but does not guarantee work levels beyond the specific job bid 
for contract drilling services  fees are charged based on standard dayrates or  to a lesser extent  as negotiated by footage contracts 
product sales are generated through our supply stores  our southeast asian business and through wholesale distributors  using a purchase order process and a pre determined price book 
outlook our growth strategy includes a focus on internal growth in our current basins and seek to maximize our equipment utilization  add additional like kind equipment and expand service and product offerings 
in addition  we identify new basins in which to replicate this approach 
we also augment our internal growth through strategic acquisitions 
internal capital investment 
our internal expansion activities generally consist of adding equipment and qualified personnel in locations where we have established a presence 
we expect to grow our operations in each of these locations by expanding services to current customers  attracting new customers and hiring local personnel with local basin level expertise and leadership recognition 
depending on customer demand  we will consider adding equipment to further increase the capacity of services currently being provided and or add equipment to expand the services we provide 
we invested million in equipment additions over the three year period ended december   which included million for the completion and production services segment  million for the drilling services segment  million for the product sales segment and million related to general corporate operations 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital equipment during the year ended december  external growth 
we use strategic acquisitions as an integral part of our growth strategy 
we consider acquisitions that will add to our service offerings in a current operating area or that will expand our geographical footprint into a targeted basin 
we have completed several acquisitions in recent years 
these acquisitions affect our operating performance period to period 
accordingly  comparisons of revenue and operating results are not necessarily comparable and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we have invested an aggregate of million in acquisitions over the three year period ended december  excluding the acquisition of minority interests in ces and iem resulting from the combination 
of this amount  we invested an aggregate of million to acquire businesses during and million to acquire companies during  including the value of equity issued and debt assumed in conjunction with those acquisitions  a portion of which was associated with earn out agreements for and acquisitions 
see significant acquisitions 
natural gas prices have declined from historical highs in and rotary rig counts may have peaked in and have recently begun to decline  particularly in canada 
this trend could be the result of a number of macro economic factors  such as a perceived excess supply of natural gas  lower demand for oil and gas or the use of alternate fuels  market expectations of weather conditions and the utilization of heating fuels  the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and other general market conditions for the us economy 
although we cannot determine the impact that lower commodity prices and rotary rig counts may have on our business or whether such declines will be long term  we believe that north american oilfield activity and the overall long term outlook for our business remains favorable from an activity perspective  especially in the basins in which we operate  including the piceance  greater green river and dj basins in the rocky mountain region  the barnett shale of north texas and anadarko and arkoma basins in the mid continent region  including the fayetteville shale in arkansas and the woodford shale in oklahoma 
we believe that the fundamentals in these markets are favorable  but we have begun to experience less favorable pricing and lower utilization for some service offerings in certain areas in which we operate  which may be due in part to an increase in equipment placed into service in the region by our competitors  a slow down of activity by our customers due to limited pipeline take away capacity  particularly in southwest wyoming  or a belief that current inventory levels of natural gas may exceed expected demand for the short term 

table of contents during  activity levels in canada have declined significantly compared to recent years 
this decline may be partially the result of an excess of natural gas currently in storage in canada and an overall reluctance of major oil and gas companies to invest as heavily in drilling and exploration efforts due to perceived unfavorable tax treatment related to royalty arrangements and other governmental restrictions 
although we believe that this market will recover in future periods  we cannot determine when this recovery will occur or if such recovery will result in favorable operating results which are comparable to the levels achieved in prior years 
based upon our assessment of our expected future cash flows from operations in canada  we recorded a non cash impairment loss related to the write down of goodwill at our canadian subsidiary during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a reduction of operating income and net income by million  as we did not receive a tax benefit associated with this impairment loss 
we still remain invested in the canadian market and believe the fundamentals are such to encourage a recovery in this market in the future 
our business continues to be impacted by seasonality and inclement weather conditions 
our completion and production services business in canada experienced a slower than expected recovery from the effects of the normal second quarter canadian break up 
our operations in south texas  mexico and the mid continent region were also impacted by gulf of mexico tropical weather systems and inclement weather during as drilling activity has trended upwards the last few years and oilfield activity levels have increased  we  and many of our competitors  have invested in new equipment  some of which requires long lead times to manufacture 
as more of this equipment is placed into service  there could be excess capacity in the industry  which we believe may have negatively impacted our utilization rates and pricing for certain service offerings during the latter half of  and may continue to impact our operations in future periods 
in addition  as new equipment enters the market  we must compete for employees to crew the equipment  which puts inflationary pressure on labor costs  and higher oil and gas commodity prices have resulted in higher fuel costs to operate our equipment 
our equipment fleet is relatively new  as we made significant investments in new equipment over the past two years and expect to continue to invest in equipment to the extent that we expect demand to remain high for certain of our service offerings  in particular our well service and coiled tubing services 
we continue to monitor our equipment utilization and poll our customers to assess demand levels 
as more equipment enters the marketplace  we believe our customers will increasingly rely upon service providers with local knowledge and expertise  which we believe we have and which constitutes a fundamental aspect of our strategic acquisition growth strategy 
significant acquisitions during  we acquired substantially all the assets or all of the equity interests in six oilfield service companies  and the remaining interest in our canadian joint venture  for million in cash  resulting in goodwill of approximately million 
several of these acquisitions are subject to final working capital adjustments

as such  we price our services and products to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate  adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary 
we examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as one measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment 
seasonality our completion and production services business generally experiences a decline in sales for our canadian operations during the second quarter of each year due to seasonality  as weather conditions make oil and gas operations in this region difficult during this period 
our canadian operations accounted for approximately  and of total revenues from continuing operations during the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we must use our judgment related to uncertainties in order to make these estimates and assumptions 
in the selection of our critical accounting policies  the objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations for each reporting period in a consistent manner that can be understood by the reader of our financial statements 
our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates  and have provided a description  information about variability and our historical experience  including a sensitivity analysis  if applicable 
continuity of interests accounting we applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations to account for the formation of complete 
sfas no 
permits us to account for the combination of several predecessor companies using a method similar to a pooling of interests if each is controlled by a common stockholder 
in connection with the combination  we paid a dividend to our stockholders of per share and adjusted the number of shares subject to  and exercise price of  outstanding stock options and restricted shares in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
on september   we completed the transaction  pursuant to which ces and iem stockholders exchanged all of their common stock for common stock of ips 
ces stockholders received shares of ips common stock for each share of ces common stock  and iem stockholders received shares of ips common stock for each share of iem common stock 
in connection with the combination  ips changed its name to complete production services  inc we acquired the interests of the minority stockholders in these predecessor companies as of the date of the consummation and accounted for these transactions using the purchase method of accounting  
table of contents resulting in goodwill of million  which represented the excess of the purchase price over the carrying value of the net assets acquired 
application of sfas no 
is required under us gaap when entities under common control are combined 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenue as services are performed and when realized or earned 
revenue is deemed to be realized or earned when we determine that the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these services are generally provided over a relatively short period of time pursuant to short term contracts at pre determined dayrate fees  or on a day to day basis 
revenue and costs related to drilling contracts are recognized as work progresses 
progress is measured as revenue is recognized based upon dayrate charges 
for certain contracts  we may receive lump sum payments from our customers related to the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment 
under these arrangements  we defer revenues and the related cost of services and recognize them over the term of the drilling contract 
costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred 
revenues associated with product sales are recorded when product title is transferred to the customer 
under current gaap  revenue is to be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the sec s rules and regulations provide additional guidance for revenue recognition under specific circumstances  including bill and hold transactions 
there is a risk that our results of operations could be misstated if we do not record revenue in the proper accounting period 
the nature of our business has been such that we generally bill for services over a relatively short period of time and record revenues as products are sold 
we did not record material adjustments resulting from revenue recognition issues for the years ended december   and impairment of long lived assets we evaluate potential impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  excluding goodwill and other intangible assets without defined services lives  when indicators of impairment are present  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if such indicators are present  we project the fair value of the assets by estimating the undiscounted future cash in flows to be derived from the long lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives  as well as any salvage value 
then  we compare this fair value estimate to the carrying value of the assets and determine whether the assets are deemed to be impaired 
for goodwill and other intangible assets without defined service lives  we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires an annual impairment test  whereby we estimate the fair value of the asset by discounting future cash flows at a projected cost of capital rate 
if the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value of the asset  an additional test is required whereby we apply a purchase price analysis consistent with that described in sfas no 
if impairment is still indicated  we would record an impairment loss in the current reporting period for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its projected fair value 
our industry is highly cyclical and the estimate of future cash flows requires the use of assumptions and our judgment 
periods of prolonged down cycles in the industry could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and may result in impairment charges 
if our estimates do not approximate actual performance or if the rates we used to discount cash flows vary significantly from actual discount rates  we could overstate our assets and an impairment loss may not be timely identified 
we tested goodwill for impairment for each of the years ended december    and for the years ended december  and  management determined that goodwill was not impaired 
however  in  management prepared a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair market value of each reportable unit as of the testing date  october  projected cash flows were based on certain management assumptions related to expected growth  capital investment and terminal value  discounted at a market participant weighted average cost of capital  refined to reflect our current and anticipated capital structure 
based on this analysis  
table of contents management determined that goodwill in canada was impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 management performed a step two analysis to calculate the amount by which the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeded the projected fair market value of such unit as of october  as a result  management recorded an impairment charge which reduced goodwill in canada by million 
in calculating this impairment charge  management made assumptions about future earnings in canada  which may differ from actual future earnings for this reportable unit  which could result in a future impairment charge 
in addition  a significant decline in expected future cash flow as a result of lower revenues  an overall decline in market conditions in canada or a lower than expected recovery of the canadian market in future years  could result in an impairment charge 
a impairment of total goodwill at december  would have decreased our operating income by million for the year then ended 
stock options and other stock based compensation we have issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers and directors in the form of stock options and non vested restricted stock 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january   which impacted our accounting treatment of employee stock options 
as required by sfas no 
r  we continue to account for stock based compensation for grants made prior to september   the date of our initial filing with the sec  using the minimum value method prescribed by apb no 
 whereby no compensation expense is recognized for stock based compensation grants that have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
however  for grants of stock based compensation between october  and december  prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we have utilized the modified prospective transition method to record expense associated with these options 
under this transition method  we did not record compensation expense associated with these stock option grants during the period october  through december   but will provide pro forma disclosure of this expense as appropriate 
however  we will recognize expense related to these grants over the remaining vesting period  based upon a calculated fair value 
for grants of stock based compensation on or after january   we apply the prospective transition method under sfas no 
r  whereby we recognize expense associated with new awards of stock based compensation  as determined using a black scholes pricing model over the expected term of the award 
in addition  we record compensation expense associated with non vested restricted stock which has been granted to certain of our directors  officers and employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we calculate compensation expense on the date of grant number of options granted multiplied by the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and recognize this expense  adjusted for forfeitures  ratably over the applicable vesting period 
gaap permits the use of various models to determine the fair value of stock options and the variables used for the model are highly subjective 
for purposes of determining compensation expense associated with stock options granted after january   we are required to determine the fair value of the stock options by applying a pricing model which includes assumptions for expected term  discount rate  stock volatility  expected forfeitures and a dividend rate 
the use of different assumptions or a different model may have a material impact on our financial disclosures 
for years ended on or before december   we determined the value of our stock options by applying the minimum value method permitted by apb no 
and  in connection with estimating compensation expense that would be required to be recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we used a black scholes model including assumptions for expected term ranging from to years as of december   risk free rate based upon published rates for us treasury notes with a similar term  zero dividend rate and a volatility rate of zero 
for the years ended december  and  we applied a black scholes model with similar assumptions  except we estimated our stock volatility by examining the volatility rates of several peer companies  we estimated a forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience and we estimated the expected term of the options using a probability analysis 
for the years ended december  and  we have recorded compensation expense totaling million and million  respectively  related to our stock option grants and million and million  respectively  related to our non vested restricted stock 
allowance for bad debts and inventory obsolescence we record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts  less an allowance for bad debts 
inventory is recorded at cost  less an allowance for obsolescence 
to estimate these allowances  management reviews the underlying details 
table of contents of these assets as well as known trends in the marketplace  and applies historical factors as a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
there is a risk that management may not detect uncollectible accounts or unsalvageable inventory in the correct accounting period 
bad debt expense has been less than of sales for the years ended december   and if bad debt expense had increased by of sales for the years ended december   and  net income would have declined by million  million and million  respectively 
our obsolescence and other inventory reserves as of december   and have ranged from to 
our obsolescence and other inventory reserves were approximately of inventory at december  and a increase in inventory reserves  from to  at december  would have decreased net income by million for the year then ended 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major betterments to existing assets are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the service lives of our equipment are expensed 
we determine the useful lives of our depreciable assets based upon historical experience and the judgment of our operating personnel 
we generally depreciate the historical cost of assets  less an estimate of the applicable salvage value  on the straight line basis over the applicable useful lives 
upon disposition or retirement of an asset  we record a gain or loss if the proceeds from the transaction differ from the net book value of the asset at the time of the disposition or retirement 
gaap permits various depreciation methods to recognize the use of assets 
use of a different depreciation method or different depreciable lives could result in materially different results 
if our depreciation estimates are not correct  we could over or understate our results of operations  such as recording a disproportionate amount of gains or losses upon disposition of assets 
there is also a risk that the useful lives we apply for our depreciation calculation will not approximate the actual useful life of the asset 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are materially correct and that these estimates are consistent with industry averages 
we evaluate property  plant and equipment for impairment when there are indicators of impairment 
there have been no significant impairment charges related to our long term assets during the years ended december   and depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and represented and of the average depreciable asset base for the respective years 
an increase in depreciation relative to the depreciable base of  from to  would have reduced net income by approximately million for the year ended december  self insurance on january   we began a self insurance program to pay claims associated with health care benefits provided to certain of our employees in the united states 
pursuant to this program  we have purchased a stop loss insurance policy from an insurance company 
our accounting policy for this self insurance program is to accrue expense based upon the number of employees enrolled in the plan at pre determined rates 
as claims are processed and paid  we compare our claims history to our expected claims in order to estimate incurred but not reported claims 
if our estimate of claims incurred but not reported exceeds our current accrual  we record additional expense during the current period 
there is a risk that we may not estimate our incurred but not reported claims correctly or that our stop loss provision may not be adequate to insure us against material losses in the future 
at december   we accrued million pursuant to this self insurance program 
a increase in this self insurance accrual would reduce our net income for the year ended december  by million  respectively 
deferred income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes related to the united states  canada and other foreign countries  including local  state and provincial income taxes 
we account for tax ramifications using sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and measure tax expense using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of the change 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires us to record a valuation allowance for any net deferred income tax assets which we believe are likely to not be used through future operations 
as of december   and  we recorded a valuation allowance of less than million related to certain deferred tax assets in canada 
if our estimates and assumptions related to our deferred tax position change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as of december   we did not provide deferred us income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in which we intend to indefinitely reinvest 
upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
on january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  which provides guidance to account for uncertain tax positions 
during  we performed an evaluation of our tax positions pursuant to financial interpretation no 
fin and determined that this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there is a risk that estimates related to the use of loss carry forwards and the realizability of deferred tax accounts may be incorrect  and that the result could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  future changes in tax laws or gaap requirements could result in additional valuation allowances or the recognition of additional tax liabilities 
historically  we have utilized net operating loss carry forwards to partially offset current tax expense  and we have recorded a valuation allowance to the extent we expect that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized through future operations 
deferred income tax assets totaled million at december   against which we recorded a valuation allowance of million  leaving a net deferred tax asset of million deemed realizable 
changes in our valuation allowance would affect our net income on a dollar for dollar basis 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that we classify the assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale if the following criteria are met management  with appropriate authority  commits to a plan to sell a disposal group  the asset is available for immediate sale in its current condition  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions to complete the sale have been initiated  the sale is probable  the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price  and actions required to complete the plan of sale indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan of sale will occur or that the plan will be withdrawn 
once deemed held for sale  we no longer depreciate the assets of the disposal group 
upon sale  we calculate the gain or loss associated with the disposition by comparing the carrying value of the assets less direct costs of the sale with the proceeds received 
in conjunction with the sale  we settle inter company balances between us and the disposal group and allocate interest expense to the disposal group for the period the assets were held for sale

completion and production services 
the decline in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment reflects a full year s benefit in of capital invested throughout  with additional equipment placed into service during and the benefit of a full year of margin contribution from our pressure pumping business in compared to only two months contribution in due to timing of the acquisition 
we experienced favorable margins in compared to for our well service  coiled tubing  fluid handling and rental businesses 
however  in late  we began to experience lower pricing for certain of these services in some of our operating regions  as well as a general decline in 
table of contents activity levels in canada which impacted our operating margins  reducing our overall margin improvements to only year over year 
in addition  we experienced higher labor and fuel costs which partially offset the incremental margin contribution of our completion and production services businesses during compared to drilling services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment represented a decline in margin during compared to due to lower pricing for our contract drilling and drilling logistics businesses  and lower utilization of our equipment  specifically impacting our drilling rigs business  due to downtime associated with maintenance  and more market competition  as our competitors deployed additional rigs into the markets we serve 
in addition  we incurred costs associated with relocating a portion of our rig logistics business to areas with more favorable market conditions 
product sales 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for the products segments was primarily due to the mix of products sold through our supply stores  including an increase in sales of relatively lower margin tubular goods in compared to  and the timing of equipment sales and refurbishment associated with our southeast asian operations

we were able to obtain more favorable pricing for our completion and production services segment and drilling services segment for these periods as a result of higher customer demand for these services primarily in the barnett shale region of north texas  and the impact of acquired businesses 
margins associated with our product sales business declined slightly compared to the respective period in  due primarily to the product mix and costs associated with opening new supply stores

discontinued operations discontinued operations represent the results of operations  net of tax  of certain manufacturing and production enhancement operations of a canadian subsidiary  including related assets located in south texas 
this disposal group was sold on october  liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  such as expanding our coiled tubing  wireline and production testing fleets  pressure pumping fleets and fluid handling equipment  increasing and replacing rental tool 
table of contents and well service rigs  and funding general working capital needs 
in addition  we need capital to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have historically been cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities  a private placement of debt which was subsequently exchanged for publicly registered debt and the issuance of equity securities in our initial public offering 
on april   we sold  shares of our 
par value common stock in an initial public offering at an initial offering price to the public of per share  which provided proceeds of approximately million net of underwriters fees 
we used these funds to retire principal and interest outstanding under our us revolving credit facility on april  totaling approximately million  to pay transaction costs of approximately million and invested the remaining funds in tax free and tax advantaged municipal bonds and similar financial instruments 
of this amount  we utilized million associated with acquisitions  including arkoma  turner and pinnacle  and the remainder was used for other general corporate purposes 
as of september  all proceeds from our initial public offering had been utilized 
we anticipate that we will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility  future debt offerings and or future public equity offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
we believe that funds from these sources should be sufficient to meet both our short term working capital requirements and our long term capital requirements 
we believe that our operating cash flows and availability under our amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry  and general financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the following table summarizes cash flows by type for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross receipts as a result of increased revenues 
our gross receipts increased throughout the three years ended december  as demand for our services grew  we invested in more equipment and logged incremental billable hours  while we continued to expand our current business and enter new markets through acquisitions 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million 
this increase was also attributable to an increase in gross receipts  as revenues increased as a result of acquisitions  higher demand for our services and favorable pricing 
we expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities for the foreseeable future  and expect that new acquisitions will provide incremental operating cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities declined by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decline in the use of funds for acquisitions 
during  we focused our efforts on investing in organic growth through equipment purchases rather than investment in acquired businesses 
during  we invested more significantly in acquisitions to expand our geographic reach in areas where we have operations and into new basins within north america  while investing million in capital equipment 
cash used in investing activities in was partially offset by million received in cash related to the sale of certain discontinued operations 
in addition  we invested million in short term investments  which were sold and used for the following purposes to acquire a series of businesses  to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility  to pay estimated federal income taxes  and for other general corporate purposes 
significant capital equipment expenditures in included five coiled tubing units and over forty well service rigs  as well as additional pressure pumping units

net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary source of funds from financing activities in was net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  semi annual interest payments on our senior notes and quarterly federal income tax payments 
however  in  the primary source of funds from financing activities was the receipt of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in april  which provided approximately million 
in addition  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes in december  and we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund various business acquisitions 
the primary use of funds from financing activities was to repay million outstanding under our us revolving credit facility as of april  with subsequent borrowings and repayments under this revolving credit facility throughout the year ended december   and the repayment of million under our term loan facility in  the majority of which was repaid in december from the proceeds of our senior note issuance 
in  we refinanced our term loan and revolving credit facilities  borrowed to finance the parchman acquisition and borrowed additional funds for general corporate purposes 
in addition  we received approximately million from our private equity sponsor  in connection with the exercise of a stock warrant 
our long term debt balances  including current maturities  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to expend approximately million for investment in capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  during the year ended december  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
in addition to investing in capital expenditures  we expect to continue to evaluate acquisitions of complementary companies 
we evaluate each acquisition based upon the circumstances and our financing capabilities at that time 
dividends on september   we paid a dividend of per share for an aggregate payment of approximately million to stockholders of record on that date 
we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future  but rather plan to reinvest such funds in our business 
furthermore  our credit facility contains restrictive debt covenants which preclude us from paying future dividends on our common stock 
description of our indebtedness on december   we issued senior notes with a face value of million through a private placement of debt 
these notes mature in years  on december   and require semi annual interest payments  paid in arrears and calculated based on an annual rate of  on june and december of each year  commencing on june  there was no discount or premium associated with the issuance of these notes

additionally  we may redeem some or all of the notes prior to december  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus a make whole premium 
on june  and december   we paid interest associated with these senior notes totaling million and million  respectively 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the holders of our senior notes  on june   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which enabled these holders to 
table of contents exchange their notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms 
these holders exchanged of these notes for publicly traded notes on july  on august   we entered into a supplement to the indenture governing the senior notes  whereby additional domestic subsidiaries became guarantors under the indenture 
on december   we amended and restated our existing senior secured credit facility the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  as us administrative agent  and certain other financial institutions

recent accounting pronouncements and authoritative literature in june  the fasb issued an interpretation entitled accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 referred to as fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions that may have been taken by an entity 
specifically  fin prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold to measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return through a two step process determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  after all appeals  based upon the technical merits of the position  and measuring to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements  assuming taxing authorities have all relevant information concerning the issue 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this pronouncement also specifies how to present a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in a classified balance sheet  but does not change the classification requirements for deferred taxes 
under fin  if a tax position previously failed the more likely than not recognition threshold  it should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is met 
similarly  a position that no longer meets this recognition threshold  should be derecognized in the first financial reporting period that the threshold is no longer met 
we adopted fin on january  with no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this pronouncement permits entities to use the fair value method to measure certain financial assets and liabilities by electing an irrevocable option to use the fair value method at specified election dates 
after election of the option  subsequent changes in fair value would result in the recognition of unrealized gains or losses as period costs during the period the change occurred 
sfas no 
becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   with early adoption permitted 
however  entities may not retroactively apply the provisions of sfas no 
to fiscal years preceding the date of adoption 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
which postpones certain provisions of sfas no 
related to disclosure requirements for non financial assets and liabilities except for items which are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  for additional disclosure related to sfas no 
 see note  significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements at december  in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fin  an amendment to fin  which provides guidance on how an entity is to determine whether a tax position has effectively settled for purposes of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
specifically  this guidance states that an entity would recognize a benefit 
table of contents when a tax position is effectively settled using the following criteria the taxing authority has completed its examination including all appeals and administrative reviews  the entity does not plan to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and it is remote that the taxing authority would examine or reexamine any aspect of the tax position  assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information relative to making their assessment on the position 
we will apply this guidance going forward  as applicable 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidating financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this pronouncement establishes accounting and reporting standards for non controlling interests  commonly referred to as minority interests 
specifically  this statement requires that the non controlling interest be presented as a component of equity on the balance sheet  and that net income be presented prior to adjustment for the non controlling interests portion of earnings with the portion of net income attributable to the parent company and the non controlling interest both presented on the face of the statement of operations 
in addition  this pronouncement provides a single method of accounting for changes in the parent s ownership interest in the non controlling entity  and requires the parent to recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary with a non controlling interest is deconsolidated 
additional disclosure items are required related to the non controlling interest 
this pronouncement becomes effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the statement should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the statement is adopted 
however  the disclosure requirements must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
may have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 business combinations which will replace that pronouncement in its entirety 
while the revised statement will retain the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 it will also require that all assets and liabilities and non controlling interests of an acquired business be measured at their fair value  with limited exceptions  including the recognition of acquisition related costs and anticipated restructuring costs separate from the acquired net assets 
in addition  the statement provides guidance for recognizing pre acquisition contingencies and states that an acquirer must recognize assets and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at acquisition date fair values  but must recognize all other contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values  only if it is more likely than not that these contingencies meet the definition of an asset or liability in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
furthermore  this statement provides guidance for measuring goodwill and recording a bargain purchase  defined as a business combination in which total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree  and it requires that the acquirer recognize that excess in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
this statement becomes effective at the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and must be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement may have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the demand  pricing and terms for oil and gas services provided by us are largely dependent upon the level of activity for the us and canadian gas industry 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including  but not limited to the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other transportation capacity  weather conditions  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers 
the level of activity in the us and canadian oil and gas exploration and production industry is volatile 
no assurance can be given that our expectations of trends in oil and gas production activities will reflect actual future activity levels or that demand for our services will be consistent with the general activity level of the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas exploration and development 
table of contents efforts and therefore affect demand for our services 
a material decline in oil and gas prices or us and canadian activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenues from continuing operations  respectively  and and of our total assets  respectively  were denominated in canadian dollars  our functional currency in canada 
as a result  a material decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar may negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and net income 
each one percentage point change in the value of the canadian dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million 
we do not currently use hedges or forward contracts to offset this risk 
our mexican operation uses the us dollar as its functional currency  and as a result  all transactions and translation gains and losses are recorded currently in the financial statements 
the balance sheet amounts are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate at the end of the month and the income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the month 
we estimate that a hypothetical one percentage point change in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million 
currently  we conduct a portion of our business in mexico in the local currency  the mexican peso 
approximately of our debt at december  is structured under floating rate terms and  as such  our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the prime rates in the us and canada 
based on the debt structure in place as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates relative to our floating rate obligations would increase interest expense by approximately million per year and reduce operating cash flows by approximately million  net of tax
