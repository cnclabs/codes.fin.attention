item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis reflects roma financial corporation s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data 
we include it to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with roma financial corporation s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k  and other statistical data provided herein 
overview financial condition and results of operations 
roma financial corporation s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earnings assets and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
it is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus average balances of deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds 
our interest earning assets primarily consist of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
at december   total loans comprised of our total assets and our securities portfolio comprised of our total assets 
the most significant change in interest earning assets from the prior year was a million or increase in the average balance of loans receivable net from million at december  to million at december  at year end  actual loans receivable  net  totaled million 
during and  a key goal of management was growth in the loan portfolio  particularly multi family and commercial real estate loans 
multi family and commercial real estate loans increased by  or million  from to and  or million  from to during  the amount of securities held to maturity that were called increased as rates dropped 
to the extent those calls were not yet deployed into loans and other assets  the proceeds from the calls were invested in short term interest earning deposits  contributing to a million  or  increase in cash and cash equivalents 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of retail deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
at december   our total deposits were million  compared to million at december  our borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york were million compared to million a year earlier 
in the fourth quarter of  the bank borrowed million from the federal home loan bank of new york which resulted in the increase from year to year 
the million  or  increase in deposits was primarily in certificates of deposits which increased as a percent of total deposits from in to in management continued to be challenged during to balance the rate of attrition while containing the cost of funds 
management was able to limit non interest bearing deposits to a decrease of 
million to million  or a decrease of 
savings and club accounts fell by million to million  as depositors continued to move money from this category to certificates of deposit 
our net interest income increased to million in from million in the net interest spread decreased to from in  as the average cost of interest bearing liabilities climbed basis points  while the yield on interest earning assets improved only basis points 
for  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was and the average yield on interest earning assets was 
total interest income increased due to a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and a basis point increase in average yield 
interest expense increased primarily due to a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities which more than offset a decrease of in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased due to the reinvestment of maturing securities in the second half of into higher yielding securities and loans as well as into interest earning cash and cash equivalents 
our results of operation are also influenced by our provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest income includes service fees and charges including income generated by the bank s retail branch network and operations  income from bank owned life insurance  and title insurance revenue from our title agency subsidiary 
non interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non interest income increased 
million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of overdraft protection fees for a full year in  compared to five months in non interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense decreased by 
million or to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits  offset by a million decrease in contributions due to the one time contribution in to the roma bank community foundation in conjunction with our initial public offering 
net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased net interest income and the contribution in to the foundation  partially offset by increases in non interest expenses 
total assets increased million or to million from million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased million from year to year primarily due to calls of securities held to maturity which to the extent they were not deployed into loans were invested in overnight funds 
loans receivable increased million while investment securities held to maturity decreased million to million at december  stockholders equity decreased million or to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the use of million of capital to repurchase stock  offset by net income  a reduction in other comprehensive income  and  a reduction in equity for allocated esop shares 
business strategy 
our current business strategy is to seek growth and improve profitability by o increasing the volume of loan originations and the size of loan portfolio relative to our securities portfolio  o increasing originations of multi family and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and commercial business loans  o building core banking business through internal growth and de novo branching  as well as de novo banking  and judiciously considering expansion through acquisition opportunities 
o developing a sales culture by training and encouraging branch personnel to promote existing products and services to our customers  and o maintaining high asset quality 
historically  our deposits have exceeded our residential loan originations  and we have invested those deposits primarily in mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
over the last few years we have focused on building a non residential loan portfolio 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported and are described in detail in note to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and income for the periods then ended 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses known and inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we consider the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
we utilize a segmented approach which identifies impaired loans for which specific reserves are established  classified loans for which a higher allowance is established  and performing loans for which a general valuation allowance is established 
we maintain a loan review system which provides for a systematic review of the loan portfolios and the early identification of impaired loans 
the review of residential real estate and home equity consumer loans  as well as other more complex loans  is triggered by identified evaluation factors  including delinquency status  size of loan  type of collateral and the financial condition of the borrower 
all commercial loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
specific loan loss allowances are established for impaired loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of the underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
although specific and general loan loss allowances are established in accordance with management s best estimate  actual losses are dependent upon future events  and as such  further provisions for loan losses may be necessary in order to increase the level of the allowance for loan losses 
for example  our evaluation of the allowance includes consideration of current economic conditions  and a change in economic conditions could reduce the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans 
this could result in increased delinquencies and increased non performing loans  and thus a need to make increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
any such increase in provisions would result in a reduction to our earnings 
a change in economic conditions could also adversely affect the value of properties collateralizing real estate loans  resulting in increased charges against the allowance and reduced recoveries  and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  a change in the composition  or growth  of our loan portfolio could result in the need for additional provisions

liquidity  commitments and capital resources the bank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing and financing activities 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of mortgage backed securities and outstanding loans  maturities of investment securities and funds provided from operations 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in short term interest earnings assets such as overnight deposits or us agency securities  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  general interest rates  economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
the bank attempts to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity  and liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
the bank reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations  including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving the bank s facilities 
these financial instruments include significant purchase commitments  such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase investment securities or mortgage backed securities  and commitments to extend credit to meet the financial needs of our customers 
at december   we had no significant off balance sheet commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
for additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at december   see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
impact of inflation the financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of non interest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk qualitative analysis 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  a significant form of market risk for us is interest rate risk  or changes in interest rates 
we derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
in general  the larger the spread  the more we earn 
when market rates of interest change  the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate 
this can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income 
the rates that we earn on our assets are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
we  like many savings institutions  have liabilities that have generally shorter contractual maturities than our assets  such as certificates of deposit  or have no stated maturity  such as savings and money market deposits 
this imbalance can create significant volatility because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on our assets  which consist primarily of long term fixed rate securities  may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities 
while the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates  which we use as a guide to our deposit pricing  have increased  intermediate and long term market interest rates  which we use as a guide to our loan pricing  have not increased proportionately 
this has led to a flattening of the market yield curve  which has even inverted as short term rates have exceeded long term rates over an intermediate maturity horizon 
the flat yield curve has hurt our interest rate spread and net interest margin because the interest rates we pay on our deposits have repriced upwards faster than the interest rates that we earn on our loans and investments 
if short term interest rates continue to rise so that the yield curve remains relatively flat or inverts further  we would expect that our new interest spread and net interest margin would continue to compress  which would hurt our net interest income 
a failing rate environment would result in a decrease in rates we pay on deposits and borrowings  but the decrease in the cost of our funds may not be as great at the decrease in the yields on our loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities and loan portfolios 
this could cause a narrowing of our net interest rate spread and could cause a decrease in our earnings 
quantitative analysis 
the following table presents the bank s net portfolio value as of december  the net portfolio values shown in this table were calculated by the office of thrift supervision  based on information provided by the bank 
caption december  net portfolio value net portfolio value as of present value of assets net portfolio basis point changes in rate amount change change value ratio change 
del bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp del 
the bp and bp scenarios are not shown due to the low prevailing interest rate environment 
future interest rates or their effect on net portfolio value or net interest income are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  prepayments  and deposit run offs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react in different times and in different degrees to changes in the marker interest rates 
the interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities  such as demand deposits and savings accounts  may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result as the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
notwithstanding the discussion above  the quantitative interest rate analysis presented above indicates that a rapid increase in interest rates would adversely affect our net interest margin and earnings
