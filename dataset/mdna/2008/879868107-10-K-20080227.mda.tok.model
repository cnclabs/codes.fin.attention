non gaap financial measure return on investment roi is an important internal measure for us because it is a key component of our evaluation of overall performance and the performance of our business segments 
studies have shown that 
table of contents there is a direct correlation between shareholder value and roi and that shareholder value is created when roi exceeds the cost of capital 
roi allows us to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis as the amount we earn relative to the amount invested in our business segments 
a significant portion of senior management s compensation is based on achieving roi targets 
in evaluating overall performance  we define roi as total segment operating income  less general and administrative expenses and share based compensation not allocated to segments  divided by total assets  less certain assets and certain current liabilities 
as a result of our transformation in  we modified the return portion of this calculation 
the roi for all prior years has been recalculated to reflect this change 
we do not believe there is a comparable gaap financial measure to our definition of roi 
the reconciliation of our roi calculation to amounts reported under gaap is included in a later section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
despite its importance to us  roi is a non gaap financial measure that has no standardized definition and as a result may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms 
also there may be limits in the usefulness of roi to investors 
as a result  we encourage you to read our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
they include asset impairments  contingency reserves  and pension accounting 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have discussed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions  or operating performance could require us to revise the impairment charges we previously provided 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  currently percent  particular consideration is given to our asset allocation because approximately percent of our plan assets are debt related with a duration that closely matches that of our benefit obligation 
another important consideration is the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligation  currently percent 
differences between actual and expected rates of return and changes in the discount rate will affect future pension expense and funded status 
for example  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the projected benefit obligation by about million and the interest cost on the projected benefit obligation by about million 
however  due to our move in late to a more matched position between our plan assets and our projected benefit obligation  we would expect a basis point change in the discount rate to affect the funded status of our plan by only million and the total net periodic benefit expense by only million 
contingency reserves are established for potential losses related to litigation  environmental remediation  and disputes with taxing authorities  among other items 
estimating these reserves requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions regarding actual or potential claims  interpretations to be made by courts or 
table of contents regulatory bodies  and other factors and events that are outside our control 
changes and inaccuracies in our interpretations and actions of others could require us to revise the reserves we previously provided 
new accounting pronouncements and change in measurement date of our defined benefit and postretirement plans in the last three years  we adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  including in  fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and a fiscal year end measurement date for valuing plan assets and obligations for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans as required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
in addition  there are four new accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in and  none of which we expect to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
please read note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
transformation on december   we completed our transformation plan that was approved by our board of directors in february a summary of the significant elements of the transformation plan follows on october   we sold million acres of timberland for billion to an investment entity affiliated with the campbell group  llc and recognized a pre tax gain of billion  which is included in other operating income 
the acreage sold consisted of million acres owned in fee and leases covering  acres 
the total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in that are secured by irrevocable letters of credit issued by independent financial institutions 
we also entered into a year fiber supply agreement for pulpwood and a year fiber supply agreement for sawtimber 
both agreements are at market prices and are subject to extension 
we contributed the notes and irrevocable letters of credit received in connection with the sale of our timberland to two wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose entities 
on december   the special purpose entities pledged the notes received from the sale of the timberland as collateral for billion nonrecourse loans payable in the net cash proceeds  after alternative minimum and other taxes related to sale of the timberland and transactions costs  were billion 
we used billion of the net cash proceeds to pay a per share special cash dividend to our shareholders in december the remaining million was used to reduce debt 
we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of these special purpose entities 
as a result  we include these special purpose entities in our consolidated financial statements 
on december   we completed the spin off of our real estate segment  forestar real estate group inc forestar  and our financial services segment  guaranty financial group inc guaranty 
these spin offs were effected through tax free distributions of one share of forestar and one share of guaranty for every three shares of temple inland common stock 
these spin offs reduced retained earnings by billion

we experienced higher prices for our corrugated packaging products  however  we experienced lower prices and volumes for most of our building products 
while we continue to see the benefit in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies  the higher cost of recycled fiber used at our containerboard mills offset some of the benefits

our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  and the strength of the us dollar 
given the commodity nature of our manufactured products  we have little control over market pricing or market demand 
corrugated packaging we manufacture linerboard and corrugating medium that we convert into corrugated packaging and sell in the open market 
our corrugated packaging segment revenues are principally derived from the sale of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sale of linerboard in the domestic and export markets

fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber recycled fiber energy  principally natural gas freight depreciation health care pension and postretirement the costs of our wood and recycled fiber  energy  and freight fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in the decrease in depreciation was principally due to the continued use of fully depreciated assets and the sale of performance sheets in august

income and expenses not allocated to segments unallocated income and expenses represent expenses managed on a company wide basis and include corporate general and administrative expense  share based compensation  other operating and non operating income expense  and interest income and expense 
the decrease in general and administrative expense in was principally due to a decrease in incentive compensation 
incentive compensation fluctuates based on changes in roi 
our share based compensation fluctuates because a significant portion of our share based awards are cash based and are affected by changes in the market price of our common stock 
based on our current expectations  it is likely that share based compensation expense for will be in the range of million to million

in the s  we entered into two sale lease back transactions of production facilities with municipalities 
we entered into these transactions to mitigate property and similar taxes associated with these facilities 
the municipalities purchased these facilities from us for million  our carrying value  and we leased the facilities back from the municipalities under lease agreements  which expire in and concurrently  we purchased million of interest bearing bonds issued by these municipalities 
the bond terms are identical to the lease terms  are secured by payments under the capital lease obligations  and the municipalities are obligated only to the extent the underlying lease payments are made by us 
the interest rate implicit in the leases is the same as the interest rate on the bonds 
as a result  the present value of the capital lease obligations is million  the same as the principal amount of the bonds

purchase obligations are market priced obligations principally for pulpwood  timber  and gypsum used in our manufacturing and converting processes and for major committed capital expenditures 
we have other long term liabilities  principally liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits  unrecognized tax benefits  and deferred income taxes that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 

table of contents at year end  the liability for pension benefits was million and the liability for postretirement benefits was million 
we expect our voluntary  discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan to approximate service cost  which is estimated to be about million 
in addition  we have amended our supplemental defined benefit pension plan to allow for lump sum settlements at the time of retirement 
we offered a one time window for our current retirees to take a lump sum distribution in january we expect these lump sum payments to aggregate million in we also estimate that we will be required to pay in the range of million to million per year over the next five years to fund payments to participants of our supplemental defined benefit plan and retiree health care claims 
please read pension  postretirement medical and health care matters for additional information 
at year end  our net deferred income tax liability was million  including million of alternative minimum tax credits related to the sale of our timberland 
we do not expect any significant changes in our deferred tax liability in we expect our cash tax rate in to be below percent compared with percent in the cash tax rate is impacted by utilization of our alternative minimum tax credits and deductions for payments associated with our transformation 
we have interest rate derivative instruments outstanding at year end these interest rate instruments expire in they are non exchange traded and are valued using either third party resources or models 
at year end  the aggregate fair value of our interest rate instruments was a million liability 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest payments  operating leases  and purchase and other obligations included in the table of contractual obligations  consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations we participate in two joint ventures engaged in manufacturing and selling paper and building products 
our partner in each of these ventures is a publicly held company unrelated to us 
at year end  these ventures had million in long term debt and million of debt included in current maturities  along with various letters of credit 
we guaranteed million of the joint ventures debt service obligations and letters of credit 
our joint venture partners also provided guarantees and letters of credit 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
performance bonds and recourse obligations are primarily for workers compensation and general liability claims 
pension  postretirement medical and health care matters our non cash defined benefit pension expense was million in  million in  and million in for the year  we expect our non cash defined benefit pension expense to be about million 
we also expect a one time expense of million related to lump sum settlements of supplemental benefits 
for accounting purposes  we measure the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit plans and value the plan assets as of year end to determine the funded status 
the funded status is included on our balance sheet 
at year end  the funded status of our defined benefit plans was a liability of million compared with a liability of million at year end the change was principally due to an increase in the discount rate  a better than expected return on plan assets  and an increase in plan assets due in part to the million of voluntary  discretionary contributions we made in unrecognized actuarial losses  which 
table of contents are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and principally represent the delayed recognition of changes in the assumed discount rate and differences between expected and actual returns  were million at year end and million at year end these losses will be recognized over the average remaining service period of our current employees  which is about nine years 
we expect about million of these losses will be recognized in  compared with million recognized in we did not have any erisa cash funding requirement in  and we expect our cash funding requirement to be minimal in we made voluntary  discretionary contributions of million to the defined benefit plan in we expect our voluntary  discretionary contributions to our defined benefit plan to approximate service cost  which is estimated to be about million 
passage of the pension protection act of  which requires a minimum level of annual funding  is not expected to affect significantly our annual cash contributions 
the benefits payable from our defined benefit plan are a series of fixed monthly retirement payments 
on an annual basis an actuarial assessment of the estimated amount and timing of these retirement payments is performed 
the actuarial estimate is subject to variability due to changes in key assumptions regarding future wage inflation  participant mortality and other actuarial risks 
prior to the date of retirement  our obligation is to accumulate funds in our qualified plan sufficient to meet these related benefit payments 
the weighted average timeframe of the retirement payments is generally in the year range 
the benefit obligation  which is the present value of the estimated retirement payments  conceptually is very similar to the fair value of a portfolio of long term bonds 
the funded status of our benefit obligation that is matched by long term bonds of similar duration should remain relatively unchanged even if long term interest rates change 
in the last two months of  we transitioned to a more matched position between our assets and liabilities in our qualified defined benefit plan 
this action is expected to reduce the volatility of our defined benefit expense and our funding requirements 
as a result  our expected long term rate of return for expense is percent compared with the rate of percent 
the lower expected long term rate of return reflects the higher allocation of invested funds in fixed income securities that better match our defined benefit obligation 
for accounting purposes we measure the postretirement medical plans projected benefit obligation as of year end to determine the funded status 
at year end  the funded status of these plans was a liability of million compared with million at year end about percent of our employees participated in a consumer driven health plan in compared with percent in in  the total cost of providing health benefits was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
in  the total cost of providing health benefits was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
energy and the effects of inflation energy costs decreased million in  increased million in  and increased million in the decrease in is primarily attributable to reduced production because of the decreased demand for our building products as a result of the declines in the housing industry 
the increase in energy costs for is primarily attributable to the acquisition of standard gypsum lp in january our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in inflationary increases in compensation and certain input costs such as fiber  energy and freight have had a negative impact on our operating results 
however  we have managed to partially offset the impact of inflation through increased productivity 
our fixed assets are  and our timber and timberland were  carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber cut or timberland sold would have been significantly higher than what we reported

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current level of interest rate risk is primarily due to our variable rate  long term debt and financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end  with comparative year end information 
these estimates assume that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
increase decrease in change in income before taxes interest rates at year end at year end in millions interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in the cost of our variable rate  long term debt 
the interest rate sensitivity change from year end is due to a decrease in variable rate debt 
additionally  changes in interest rates will affect the value of our interest rate swap agreements currently million notional amount 
we believe that any changes in the value of these agreements would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
considering the fair value of these instruments at year end  we believe the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
