overview we manage our business through providing home health and hospice services with over  employees 
through our home health agencies  we deliver a wide range of services in the home of individuals who may be recovering from surgery  have a chronic disability or terminal illness or need assistance with the essential activities of daily living 
the services we provide include skilled nursing and home health aide services  physical  occupational and speech therapy  and medically oriented social work to eligible individuals who require ongoing care that cannot be provided effectively by family and friends 
in addition  we have developed and offer clinically focused programs for high cost chronic conditions and different types of diseases  such as diabetes  coronary artery disease  congestive heart failure  complex wound care  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  geriatric surgical recovery  behavioral health  and stroke recovery  as well as various rehabilitative programs  in each case focusing on improving the functional ability of our geriatric population and enhancing patient self management through compliance tracking and behavioral modification 
as an organization we continue to focus on enhancing the delivery of services to geriatric patients with chronic co morbid conditions 
we believe our services are attractive to payors and physicians because we combine clinical quality with cost effectiveness  we provide clinical consistencies in the care we provide in each of our agencies  and we are accessible hours a day  seven days a week to answer our patients questions and to provide for their medical needs 
through our hospice agencies  we provide palliative care and comfort to terminally ill patients and their families 
we provide hospice services to each patient using an interdisciplinary care team comprised of a physician  a patient care manager  registered nurses  certified home health aides  social workers  a chaplain  a homemaker and specially trained volunteers who collectively assess the clinical  psychosocial and spiritual needs of our patients and their families and manage that care accordingly 
although we expect medicare home health to remain our primary focus over the near and intermediate term  we believe home health and hospice are complementary services and we expect to continue to expand our home health and hospice networks through acquisitions and start up activities 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we purchased certain assets and certain liabilities of integricare  inc  which accounted for a majority of our acquired agencies during the year with a total of home health and nine hospice agencies in nine states 
as of december   we were located in states within the united states with the following number of agencies owned and operated agencies managed agencies home health hospice home health hospice at december  acquisitions start ups closed at december  recent developments reimbursement on august   cms issued its final rule to redefine and update the home health pps for calendar year final rule 
the final rule included changes in the base rate calculation  case mix adjustment model  implementation of refinement to the payment system and imposed new quality of care data collection requirements  among other requirements 
cms also included a increase to medicare home health rates market basket for calendar year as its suggestion to the united states congress congress for its final review and approval 
congress made no changes to the cms market basket proposal which was implemented january  since april   when cms first issued its notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the home health pps refinement and rate update for calendar year  we have been preparing for this new payment system 
we have completed the changes to our systems necessary to implement the final rule 
during this effort  we benefited from the system wide roll out of our point of care poc system  which enabled our clinical assessment data to become more consistent when compared to our pure paper environment in based on our programming  modeling and testing of the required changes  we estimated  as of october   that implementation of the final rule would reduce our medicare net service revenue for calendar year by approximately  while noting that this estimate was subject to change and had various assumptions built into it that could impact the actual results experienced 
our subsequent modeling and testing of the impact of the final rule continues to indicate that the impact is no worse than a revenue reduction of 
we implemented the new payment system on january  and subsequent to that date signed two definitive stock purchase agreements for the acquisition of home health and hospice agencies 
we do not believe that we will be able to fully refine our estimate of the impact of the final rule until we have significant data for episodes subject to the cms rate change and better understand the impact of the planned conversion of the two recently announced definitive stock purchase agreements to our processes and point of care system 
our view of these issues could be impacted by  but is not limited to  changes to the proposed market basket increase  future changes to our systems resulting from our additional programming  modeling and testing process  differences in case mix used for the estimate and the actual case mix experienced in  impact of recently announced definitive stock purchase agreements  and various other contributing factors 
operations on october   we entered into a three year  unsecured million revolving credit facility revolver  which can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions

risk factors for more details 
years ended december  and net service revenue we are dependent on medicare for a significant portion of our revenue 
approximately and of our net service revenue was derived from medicare for and  respectively 
the change in concentration of our net services revenue was primarily due to medicare patients transitioning to other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs 
the following table summarizes our net service revenue growth amounts in millions for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total home health revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue hospice revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue total revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue our net service revenue increased million  primarily as a result of our internal growth and acquisitions 
we experienced growth in our base business  inclusive of start ups of million  primarily as a result of an increased number of admissions and completed episodes  with a increase in total completed medicare episodes from in addition  our acquisitions  as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements  added million in net service revenue 
the following table summarizes our growth in home health patient admissions for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total admissions medicare non medicare during  our home health internal growth rate was as compared to in  with total episodic based admissions for our base start up agencies of  and total episodic based admissions of  for as compared to total episodic based admissions of  in as we continue to grow our operations through both internal efforts and through acquisition activities  we anticipate that our internal growth rate will be more reflective of as compared to our internal growth rate of and cost of service our cost of service consists of salaries and related payroll tax expenses  transportation expenses primarily reimbursed mileage  and supplies and services expenses including payments to contract therapists associated with our direct care employees in our agencies 
the following summarizes our visit and cost per visit information for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total cost of service amounts in millions home health hospice home health visits during the period medicare non medicare home health cost per visit we calculate home health cost per visit as home health cost of service divided by total home health visits during the period 
our cost of service increased million  with million related to our base start up agencies and million related to our acquired agencies 
the million increase in base business expenses related to admission and visit growth with increases of million in labor  taxes and benefits and million in travel 
typically  our acquisitions take up to to months to reach the operating efficiencies of existing operations 
general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses and our depreciation and amortization expense amounts in thousands for the years ended december  general and administrative expenses salaries and benefits non cash compensation other depreciation and amortization salaries and benefits increased million due primarily to increased personnel costs related to additional operational staff necessitated by our internal growth and acquisitions 
non cash compensation expense increased million due to additional employee equity awards made in as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock option payments  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of seven months  million of unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested stock payments  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and million of unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested stock unit payments  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
no stock options were awarded during other general and administrative expense increased million  which consisted of a million increase in supplies and services expense  million increase in rent expense  million increase in travel and training expenses  million increases in both purchased services and utilities expenses  and million increase in other expenses  which was partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees 
this net increase in other general and administrative expense was primarily the result of our acquisition and start up activities during other income expense  net other income was million in as compared to other expense of million during  representing a change of million 
the primary reason for this change was related to the conclusion of the alliance bankruptcy 
on september   a federal judge from the united states bankruptcy court in the northern district of oklahoma bankruptcy court overseeing the chapter federal bankruptcy proceedings for alliance finalized its order on the distribution of funds to creditors 
as a result  of the ruling by the bankruptcy court  the liabilities of million attributable to alliance now will not be paid because alliance has insufficient assets to discharge these liabilities 
these liabilities were recorded on our consolidated financial statements because of alliance s being a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary 
neither amedisys nor any of our affiliates other than alliance  has any direct obligation for these liabilities and we do not believe there is any basis for asserting that there is an indirect obligation on our part or any of our affiliates for these liabilities 
accordingly  upon completion of the alliance bankruptcy  we reversed the accrual for these liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  and we recognized a gain of million as other income in our accompanying consolidated income statement during the third quarter of the discharge of the liabilities was a non taxable event 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to the reduction in interest expense as a result in the decrease in our average outstanding debt for as compared to and an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments due to an increase in the average cash and cash equivalents and short term investments from to during the third quarter of  we completed an equity offering with cash proceeds of million  of which million was used to pay off our senior credit facility and the remainder was invested in cash equivalents and short term investments 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in as compared to million during  representing an increase of million  which is primarily attributable to an increase in income before income taxes and minority interests that is partially offset by a decrease in the estimated income tax rate 
our income before taxes and estimated income tax rate was million and for and million and for the decrease in the tax rate was primarily attributable to the reversal of the alliance liabilities resulting from the conclusion of the alliance bankruptcy  which was a nontaxable event 
years ended december  and during  we added home health agencies through acquisitions  initiated operations at new home health agencies and closed five home health agencies 
we also initiated operations at two hospice agencies and closed one hospice agency 
as a result  we owned and operated medicare certified home health agencies and medicare certified agencies in states as of december  as a result of this rapid growth during  our operating results for the years presented may not appear comparable 
net service revenue we are dependent on medicare for a significant portion of our revenue 
approximately of our net service revenue was derived from medicare for both and the following table summarizes our net service revenue growth amounts in millions for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total home health revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue hospice revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue total revenue medicare revenue non medicare revenue our net service revenue increased million  primarily as a result of our internal growth and acquisitions 
we experienced growth in our base business  inclusive of start ups of million  primarily as a result of an increased number of admissions and a increase in total completed medicare episodes from in addition  our acquisitions  as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements  added million in net service revenue 
the following table summarizes our growth in home health patient admissions for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total admissions medicare non medicare during  our home health internal growth rate was as compared to in  with total episodic based admissions for our base start up agencies of  and total episodic based admissions of  for as compared to total episodic based admissions of  in cost of service our cost of service consists of salaries and related payroll tax expenses  transportation expenses primarily reimbursed mileage  and supplies and services expenses including payments to contract therapists associated with our direct care employees in our agencies 
the following summarizes our visit and cost per visit information for the year ended december  for the year ended december  base start ups acquisitions total cost of service amounts in millions home health hospice home health visits during the period medicare non medicare home health cost per visit we calculate home health cost per visit as home health cost of service divided by total home health visits during the period 
our cost of service increased million  with million related to our base start up agencies and million related to our acquired agencies 
the million increase in base start up agency cost of service related to admission and visit growth with increases of million in labor  taxes and benefits and million in travel  which was slightly offset by a million decrease in supplies 
typically  our acquisitions take up to to months to reach the operating efficiencies of existing operations 
general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses and our depreciation and amortization expense amounts in thousands for the years ended december  general and administrative expenses salaries and benefits non cash compensation other depreciation and amortization salaries and benefits increased million due primarily to increased personnel costs of million related to additional operational staff necessitated by our internal growth and acquisitions and an increase in our corporate administrative staff including a million increase in the cost of providing health insurance and other benefits 
non cash compensation expense increased million in this increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r required the recognition of stock based compensation related to stock options in our results of operations for  as compared to the same period of when we accounted for this stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 

as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation costs related to stock option payments which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock payments which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
no stock options were awarded during other general and administrative expenses increased million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in bad debt expense that was growth related and included the impact of billing and collections for patients initially admitted as medicare and later determined to be covered by other insurance carriers including medicare advantage programs  growth related increases of million in contract services  million in supplies  million in travel and million in rent and utilities 
depreciation and amortization increased million primarily as a result of growth  with the exception of million of accelerated depreciation that related to our former corporate headquarters 
other expense  net other expense was million in the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december   representing an increase of million and is primarily attributable to the amounts of cash and debt outstanding during each of the years and the expensing of million in deferred financing fees on our outstanding debt that was repaid early 
in july  we entered into a million senior credit facility primarily to finance our acquisition activities that included a million term loan and a million revolver 
we paid in full and terminated our senior credit facility in november in conjunction with the issuance of million shares of our common stock prior to giving consideration to our four for three stock split 
as of december   we owed million that consisted of promissory notes and capital leases and as of december   owed million that consisted of our senior credit facility  promissory notes and capital leases 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in as compared to million in  representing an increase of million  and is primarily attributable to an increase in income before taxes and a decrease in the estimated income tax rate 
our income before taxes and estimated income tax rate was million and for the year ended december  and million and for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows amounts in thousands for the years ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period operating cash flows increased by million primarily as a result of the following million improvement in changes in assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions 
our overall improvement was attributable to an increase in accrued payroll and payroll taxes as a result of our growth through start ups and acquisitions and a decrease in payments made for outstanding accounts payable due primarily to a million payment made from hurricane katrina related payroll tax deferrals paid in that was non recurring in these improvements were partially offset by an increase in our outstanding patient accounts receivable  which was the result of our increase in net service revenue for the year due to our internal growth  start up and acquisition activities and a slight increase in our unbilled patient accounts receivable  and million increase in net income  offset by a million change in deferred income taxes see note to our consolidated financial statements for details on our deferred income taxes 
investing cash outflows increased million during  primarily as a result of an increase in our acquisitions of million that was offset by the sale of our former corporate jet for million see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our acquisitions 
financing cash flows decreased million from due to our million equity offering completed in that did not recur in  which was partially offset by our decrease in payments made on long term obligations during as compared to  as we used million in offering proceeds to pay off our senior credit facility in liquidity typically  our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable  primarily under the medicare program  however  from time to time  we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity through sales of our equity or by incurring additional debt 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalent and million in indebtedness related to our promissory notes and our outstanding capital leases 
in addition  we had million of liquidity available through the issuance of any combination of preferred and common stock  if needed  under our effective sec shelf registration statement  and million of liquidity available through our three year revolving credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants related to our revolver  had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver and we had million in outstanding letters of credit  which were collateralized by our revolver 
during  we spent million in capital expenditures  of which million was routine  million related to the purchase of a replacement for our corporate jet  which netted to a million cash outflow after consideration was taken for the cash proceeds received from the sale of our former jet  million related to the deployment of laptop computers to our clinical staff for our poc system and million was related to the completion of our corporate headquarters in baton rouge  louisiana during as of december   we had completed our total cash outflow related to our corporate headquarters and had capitalized the entire amount 
subsequent to december   we signed two definitive agreements for the acquisition of two home health service providers 
the first definitive stock purchase agreement was signed on february   to acquire the holding company that operates family home health care  inc and comprehensive home healthcare services  inc hma  a privately held provider of home health care services with home health locations in kentucky and three locations in tennessee for a total purchase price of approximately million  subject to working capital adjustments and other post closing adjustments 
the total purchase price is expected to be funded with million in cash and a million  two year note payable 
the second definitive stock purchase agreement was signed on february   to acquire all of the outstanding shares of tlc health care services  inc tlc  a privately held provider of home nursing and hospice services with home health and hospice agencies located in states and the district of columbia 
the total cash purchase price for the acquisition is million  subject to purchase price adjustments  and the closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals 
the total purchase price is expected to be financed with proceeds of million from new financing and an amendment to our current million revolver that we had in place at december   which are both pursuant to a fully underwritten financing commitment 
upon closing of these transactions  we estimate that million of our total million in financing will be outstanding  thus leaving us approximately million of liquidity available 
in addition  we will still have million of liquidity available under our effective sec shelf registration statement 
based on our operating forecasts  any other planned acquisition activity and our estimated impact of the finalized changes made to pps by cms  we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations and capital requirements over the next twelve months with the funds available through our operations and through available liquidity of the resources mentioned above subsequent to our pending acquisitions noted above 
despite these potential sources of liquidity  we are dependent upon a number of factors influencing our forecasts of earnings and operating cash flows 
these factors include patient growth  attaining expected results from acquisitions including our integration efforts  our ability to manage our operations based upon certain staffing formulas and certain assumptions of our reimbursement by medicare 
our reimbursement by medicare is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to  recommendations made by the medicare payment advisory commission medpac to the united states congress congress  legislation changes made by congress that directly impact the reimbursement rates paid by medicare  or changes made by cms 
for instance  we experienced a delay in reimbursement in association with the recent changes made by cms on august  to the medicare home health pps  which have been resolved 
any further changes to the medicare reimbursement methodology could have an additional material impact on our future results of operations and our expected future cash flows if such change results in significant payment delays 
we continue to monitor such regulatory and reimbursement changes proposed and made to the medicare reimbursement methodology 
further  we have certain other contingencies and reserves  including litigation reserves  recorded as liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets that we may be required to liquidate in cash in the near future 
contractual obligations and medicare liabilities our future contractual obligations and medicare liabilities at december  were as follows 
these future obligations do not include obligations associated with the pending acquisitions noted above that are expected to close in payments due by period total less than year years years after years amounts in thousands promissory notes interest on promissory notes capital leases operating leases medicare liabilities see note prior to the implementation of pps on october   we recorded medicare revenue at the lower of actual costs that considered per visit cost limit or a per beneficiary cost limit on an individual provider basis 
under the previous medicare cost based reimbursement system  ultimate reimbursement under the medicare program was determined upon final settlement of the annual cost reports 
as of december   we estimate an aggregate payable to medicare of million for these cost reports for periods prior to october  that have not been settled  all of which is reflected as a current liability in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inflation we believe that inflation has not significantly impacted our results of operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
in addition  our operating results may not be comparable for as compared to  primarily as a result of our acquisitions and start up agencies 
when we refer to base business  we mean home health and hospice agencies that we have operated for at least the last twelve months  when we refer to acquisitions  we mean home health and hospice agencies that we acquired within the last twelve months  and when we refer to start ups  we mean any new location opened by us in the last twelve months 
once an agency location has been in operation for a twelve month period  the results for that particular agency are included as part of our base business from that date forward 
when we refer to our internal growth rate  we mean our internal growth rate as calculated by the percentage increase in our total episodic based admissions of our base and start up agencies in the current period  as compared to admissions of our total episodic based admissions from the prior period 
when we refer to episodic based admissions  we mean admissions of payors that reimburse on an episodic basis  which include medicare and other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
net service revenue we earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services primarily in the homes of our patients 
this net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis day episode of care basis for home health services and day episode of care basis for the first two hospice episodes of care and on a day episode of care basis for any subsequent episodes or on a per visit basis depending upon the reimbursement terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided 
the remainder of our net service revenue for such periods was derived from medicaid  private insurance carriers and private payors 
we refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a day episode of care as episodic based revenue 
home health revenue we earn our net service revenue for home health services from medicare and medicaid and other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  for patients who have chosen not to be medicare beneficiaries 
the revenue earned from these other insurance carriers can either be reimbursed on episodic based rates or per visit rates depending upon the reimbursement terms and conditions established with such payors 
medicare revenue recognition we primarily earn our home health net service revenue from medicare 
medicare reimburses us at reimbursement rates based on the severity of our patient s condition  their service needs and other factors relating to the cost of providing services and supplies  bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished and ending days later or upon discharge  if earlier 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day  a recertification occurs and a new episode begins on the st day  regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care  as follows period base episode payment january  through december  january  through december  january  january  through december  the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table  vary depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned  the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as our patients clinical  functional and services utilization characteristics 
in november  centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced a increase to medicare home health rates market basket increase for episodes ending on or after january  and before january  episodes that began prior to december  but did not conclude until subsequent to december  were reimbursed at the rate in effect for the rate change was also accompanied by a discontinuation of a temporary add on for rural home health agencies in  except for those episodes that began before january  the market basket increase was also accompanied by a requirement that each home health agency submit required quality data using outcome and assessment information set oasis  which we are currently doing on a daily basis 
on august   cms issued its final rule to redefine and update the home health prospective payment system pps for calendar year final rule 
the final rule included changes in the base rate calculation  implementation of refinement to the payment system and imposed new quality of care data collection requirements  among other requirements 
as a result of these changes  episodes that began prior to december  but conclude after january  are reimbursed at the rate of  and episodes that began on or after january  and conclude prior to december   will be reimbursed at the rate of  net service revenue is recorded under the medicare reimbursement program pps based on a day episode reimbursement rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables including  but not limited  to a an outlier payment if our patient s care was unusually costly  b a low utilization adjustment lupa if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode  d a change in condition adjustment if the patient s medical status changed significantly  resulting in the need for more or less care  e a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required  f changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  g adjustments to the base episode payments for case mix  geographic wages and low utilization  and  h recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
net service revenue is recorded as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress based upon historical trends 
for such episodes in progress  we submit a request for anticipated payment rap to medicare for a portion of the estimated pps reimbursement from each submitted home health episode 
as of december  and  the difference between the funds received from medicare for raps on episodes in progress and the associated estimated revenue was included as a reduction to our current outstanding patient accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets for such periods  since only a nominal amount represents cash collected in advance of providing services 
we continuously compare the estimated reimbursement amounts recorded to the actual reimbursement received 
historically  any difference between estimated amounts recorded and actual amounts received has been immaterial 
we believe  based on information available to us and based on our judgment  that changes to one or more of the factors that impact the accounting estimate  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact either our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
non medicare based revenue recognition we earn our net service revenue for home health services through episodic based rates or through per visit rates from medicaid and other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  for patients who have chosen not to be medicare beneficiaries 
episodic based revenue 
we recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize medicare reimbursed revenue for episodic based rates that are reimbursed by medicaid and other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs 
non episodic based revenue 
we receive non episodic based revenue from other sources for home health services  which primarily consist of private insurance companies and private payors 
we have entered into agreements with such third party payors that provide payments  generally on a per visit basis  for services rendered at amounts different from established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue 
net service revenue is the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered 
we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
hospice revenue we determine how we will recognize net service revenue for hospice related services based on the payor type 
hospice medicare revenue recognition hospice services are generally billed to medicare on a weekly basis for patients who leave our care and on a monthly basis for ongoing care 
each hospice provider is subject to payment caps for inpatient services  the cap is based on inpatient days  which cannot exceed of all medicare hospice days 
overall medicare reimbursement is also subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of each hospice cap period 
on a monthly and quarterly basis  we estimate our potential cap exposure using information available for both inpatient day limits as well as per beneficiary cap amounts 
the total cap amount for each provider is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the per beneficiary cap amounts were  for the twelve month period ended october  and  for the twelve month period ended october  any amounts received in excess of the beneficiary cap must be refunded to medicare within fifteen days 
we have settled all years through october  without exceeding any of the cap limits and we have received notification for all but one of our providers that we have not exceeded any of the cap limits for the year ended october  for the fiscal year ended october   we believe that we will not exceed any of the cap limits and will have no amounts due to the fiscal intermediary with the exception of one recently acquired provider that we have currently recorded million as other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  for potential cap limit exposure 
we believe that changes to one or more of the factors that impact our accounting estimate for hospice revenue  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
for instance  on april   cms released a transmittal that provided for a correction of the hospice cap amount for fiscal years ended october  and  thus the new cap amounts are  and  for fiscal and  respectively  compared to the prior rates of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
this change in the cap amounts did not have an impact on our reported financial results or our liquidity 
hospice non medicare revenue recognition we have entered into agreements with third party payors  including medicaid  which provide payments for services rendered at amounts different from our established rates for hospice services provided 
we record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue 
net service revenue is the estimated net amount realizable from patients  third party payors  medicaid and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
collectibility of patient accounts receivable we report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments 
patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
to provide for patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the credit risk for other concentrations of receivables is limited due to the significance of medicare as our primary payor 
we do not believe that there are any other significant concentrations of receivables from any particular payor that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable 
our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  and trends in reimbursement 
the collection process begins with a concerted effort to ensure that the billings are accurate through the utilization of a scrubber for our medicare claims and through electronic billing with other payors 
as our claims pass through our collections process  we continually monitor the aging of our outstanding claims 
as aged claims are identified  we research each individual outstanding claim to increase our likelihood of successful collections  which can include  but is not limited to  resubmission of the claim to the payor  contacting the payor directly to clarify any issues or to provide additional requested information to allow for the claim to be processed 
if these efforts prove to be unsuccessful and we have exhausted all of our collection efforts  we will write off our aged  outstanding patient accounts receivable 
during  our patient accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts increased from million at december  to million at december  with days revenue outstanding decreasing from days in to in the million increase in outstanding patient accounts receivable consisted of a million increase in our home health outstanding patient accounts receivable and a million increase in our hospice outstanding patient accounts receivable 
the increases in both home health and hospice were primarily the result of increases in revenue year over year as a result of our internal growth  start up and acquisition activity 
despite our overall increase in outstanding patient accounts receivable  we were able to improve our days revenue outstanding by days from to the overall improvement in our days revenue outstanding was the result of an increase in our net service revenue and an increase in our contractual adjustments from the three month period ended december  to the same period in  which was offset by fewer write offs  an increase in outstanding patient accounts receivable and an overall increase in unbilled claims for recently acquired agencies due to regulatory issues primarily change in ownership provisions from to the following schedule details our patient accounts receivable by payor class  aged based upon initial date of service amounts in thousands  except days revenue outstanding current over total at december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts patient accounts receivable  net days revenue outstanding current over total at december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts patient accounts receivable  net days revenue outstanding patient accounts receivable as of december  and included final unbilled amounts of million and million  respectively  that had been aged based upon initial service date 
as of december   our aged payor classes were affected by increased collections during and the transitioning of medicare patients to other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  which are included in the private payor class above 
due to our significant acquisitions and our internal growth  our calculation of days revenue outstanding is derived by dividing our ending gross patient accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  at december  and by our average daily net patient revenue for the three month periods ended december  and  respectively 
medicare we derived approximately of our net service revenue from medicare in our pre billing process includes an electronic medicare claim review referred to as a scrubber to improve the quality of filed claims data in an effort to reduce our volume of collection effort on these accounts 
a portion of our estimated pps reimbursement from each submitted home health episode is received in the form of a rap 
we submit a rap for of our estimated reimbursement for the initial episode at the start of care 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is then deducted from our final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider number 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted 
for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient recertification  we submit a rap for instead of of the estimated reimbursement 
for payment differences between the estimated reimbursement and the amount final billed  we estimate the impact of such payment adjustments based on our historical experience and record this estimate during the period services are rendered as a contractual adjustment to revenue 
as such  we believe the amount reflected in our patient accounts receivable accurately represents the amount we will be reimbursed by medicare 
non medicare we derived approximately of our net service revenue from non medicare accounts in non medicare accounts are billed based upon payor requirements and include multiple third party payors 
we routinely perform pre billing reviews to improve the quality of our filed claims and utilize automated systems to assist in improving the quality of our electronically submitted claims 
to provide for our patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of the receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
our review and evaluation of non medicare accounts includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
where such groups have been identified  we have given special consideration to both the billing methodology and evaluation of the ultimate collectibility of the accounts 
in addition  the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in reimbursement and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
doubtful accounts are written off when we have determined the account will not be collected 
based upon our best judgment  we believe the provision for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs associated with certain of our insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability 
while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims  as described in the table below 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience and our review of the reasonableness of an analysis completed by an independent actuary 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis 
the following table presents details of our insurance programs  including amounts accrued for the periods indicated amounts in thousands  except insurance coverage amounts in accrued expenses in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets december  type of insurance coverage health insurance claims in excess of  workers compensation claims in excess of  professional liability claims in excess of  we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance with aggregate annual policy limits of million while we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of our insurance limits 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas we completed our annual impairment review as of october  with the assistance of an independent national valuation firm and determined that no impairment charge was required for our recorded goodwill 
depending on changes in medicare reimbursement  admissions volume and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
as of december   there were no indicators noted that would require us to re evaluate our annual impairment test  which was completed as of october  income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with sfas no

deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december  and  our net deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily related to an increase of million to the deferred tax liability related to property and equipment as a result of accelerated depreciation pursuant to the gulf opportunity zone act of and million in additional amortization of tax basis goodwill

for instance  acquisition related costs  with the exception of debt or equity issuance costs  are to be recorded in the period that the costs are incurred and the services are received 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
the interest rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility revolver can fluctuate based on both the interest rate option ie  base rate or libor plus applicable margins and the interest period 
as of december   we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations  as we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver
