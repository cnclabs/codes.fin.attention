item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents strategic collaborations we have established a pipeline of potential therapeutics by collaborating with  and leveraging the capabilities of  industry leaders to more efficiently advance our programs  reduce risk and conserve resources 
we have developed five classes of drug candidates protein therapeutics  fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics  which were developed in collaboration with amgen fremont  small molecule therapeutics for oncology and inflammatory diseases  which are developed in collaboration with topotarget  adcs  which are developed using antibodies generated by amgen fremont and adc technology from seattle genetics  and small molecule therapeutics for diabetes and metabolic disorders  which were developed in collaboration with bayer 
amgen fremont formerly abgenix in december  we entered into a strategic collaboration with abgenix to develop fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics 
we amended and restructured this alliance in november and april the initial phase of the agreement  involving the identification of targets and the initiation of antibody generation  was completed in june in april  amgen inc acquired abgenix  and assumed all obligations of the agreement 
under this agreement  we have advanced cr vcmmae into clinical development 
under our agreement we are obligated to pay milestones to amgen for the advancement of cr vcmmae through clinical trials and regulatory approval 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to amgen based upon net sales of cr vcmmae once commercialized 
topotarget in june  we signed a license and collaboration agreement with topotarget to develop belinostat  a novel hdac inhibitor for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies  and identify additional hdac inhibitors from topotarget s extensive library of compounds 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the exclusive right to commercialize belinostat in all markets other than europe  while topotarget has retained commercialization rights in europe 
we are obligated to fund the global development of belinostat 
in june  we paid a million perpetual license fee to topotarget and made a million equity investment that was recorded as a convertible loan receivable 
in june  we converted this loan into  shares of topotarget common stock following topotarget s initial public offering on the copenhagen stock exchange 
during september  we sold our investment in topotarget for proceeds of million and had a realized gain of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid topotarget million in development milestones from june through december additionally  we paid topotarget million for research support from june through june the research program under this agreement expired in june under our agreement with topotarget we are obligated to pay milestones to topotarget for the advancement of belinostat through clinical trials and regulatory approval 
in addition  topotarget is entitled to receive royalties from us based on sales of belinostat outside of europe and we are entitled to receive reciprocal royalties from topotarget based on sales of belinostat in europe once commercialized 
topotarget has the option to fund a portion of the global development of belinostat in exchange for higher royalties 
we are currently evaluating belinostat in a number of clinical trials as a potential treatment of cancer both as a single agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies 
in addition  we have an option to select additional hdac compounds from topotarget for clinical development in oncology and other indications for a fee payable to topotarget 
under the terms of the agreement between topotarget and us  we received of the initial payment received by topotarget under a licensing agreement between topotarget and an unrelated third party for a preclinical hdac compound 
in january  topotarget was informed by the third party that it will be ceasing development of this preclinical compound in 
table of contents seattle genetics in june  we announced the licensing of seattle genetics proprietary adc technology for use with up to two of our fully human monoclonal antibodies 
we paid an upfront fee of million for access to the adc technology for use with cr vcmmae  our first fully human monoclonal antibody program to utilize this technology which we announced in october we announced in july that an ind was filed with the fda for cr vcmmae and patient enrollment was initiated in a phase i clinical trial 
we are responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization under this collaboration 
we also pay maintenance and material supply fees as well as research support payments for ongoing assistance provided by seattle genetics in developing adc products 
under the agreement  we are obligated to pay milestones to seattle genetics for the advancement of cr vcmmae through clinical trials and regulatory approval 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to seattle genetics based upon net sales of cr vcmmae once commercialized 
we may terminate any license under the agreement by providing not less than days prior written notice to seattle genetics competition we are subject to significant competition in the development and commercialization of new drugs from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  and marketing capabilities 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials  or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 
we are aware of specific companies that are developing hdac inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer that may be competitive with ours 
with respect to our hdac inhibitor  belinostat  merck co  inc recently received fda approval to market zolinza  or vorinostat  the first hdac inhibitor approved for use in the us  for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
bayer schering pharma ag  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  methylgene  inc  and novartis pharma ag are also currently evaluating hdac inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers  and in combinations with other chemotherapies  that are similar to approaches and indications we are pursuing 
in addition  many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in research and development for the treatment of cancer from which we may face intense competition 
we expect belinostat to compete on the basis of efficacy  routes of administration  and potentially safety and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
intellectual property our business and competitive position depends in part on our ability to protect our gene sequences  the proteins they encode  fully human monoclonal antibodies raised against them  small molecules  other products  information systems and proprietary databases  software and other methods and technology 
we have filed  and continue to file  patent applications that seek to protect commercially significant aspects of our product candidates 
as of the date of this report we had been issued approximately patents worldwide including issued us patents 
curagen and our other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property of curagen corporation 
all other trademarks or trade names referred to herein are the property of their respective owners 
government regulation and product approval government authorities in the united states  at the federal  state and local level  and other countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  packaging  promotion  storage  advertising  distribution  marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing 

table of contents united states government regulation in the united states  the information that must be submitted to the fda in order to obtain approval to market a new drug varies depending on whether the drug is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredient s and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug 
a new drug will typically follow the new drug application  or nda  route and a new biologic will typically follow the biologic license application  or bla  route 
nda and bla approval processes in the united states  the fda regulates drugs and biologics under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or ffdca  and in the case of biologics  also under the public health service act  and the fda s implementing regulations 
the process required by the fda before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices  submission of an ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices  or gcps  to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  submission to the fda of an nda or bla  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  to assure that the facilities  methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug s identity  strength  quality and purity or to meet standards designed to ensure the biologic s continued safety  purity and potency  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla 
the results of product development  preclinical studies and clinical studies  along with descriptions of the manufacturing process  analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug  results of chemical studies and other relevant information are submitted to the fda as part of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product 
the fda reviews all ndas and blas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
the fda may refuse to approve an nda or bla if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data 
the fda reviews an nda to determine  among other things  whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cgmp compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity  strength  quality and purity 
the fda reviews a bla to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe  pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured  processed  packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued safety  purity and potency 
before approving an nda or bla  the fda will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured 
expedited review and approval the fda has various programs  including fast track  priority review  and accelerated approval  that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs  and or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints 
generally  drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions  those with the potential to address unmet medical needs  and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments  however  these programs do not affect the standards for approval 
fast track 
table of contents designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied 
as a condition of approval  the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post marketing clinical trials 
orphan drug under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states  or more than  individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the united states a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the united states for that drug 
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
the clinical trial processes we currently have two products  belinostat and cr vcmmae  in various stages of clinical trial development 
all clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with gcps regulations 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined and are as follows phase i the drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteer subjects or patients with the disease 
these studies are designed to determine the safety and side effects associated with increasing dosages  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion  pharmacologic and mechanism of action of the drug candidate in humans  and  if possible  to gain early evidence of effectiveness 
sufficient information about a drug candidate s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well controlled  scientifically valid  phase ii studies  phase ii involves clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the drug candidate 
these studies are typically closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients  usually involving no more than several hundred patients  and phase iii clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug candidate has been obtained  and are intended to generate additional information about the drug candidate s effectiveness and safety that is required to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug candidate and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 
the studies may include anywhere from several hundred to several thousand subjects 
concurrent with clinical trials  companies usually complete additional animal studies 
companies must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cgmp requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality  purity and potency of the final drugs 

table of contents foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology and optional for those which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under the decentralized procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessments report each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
if a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization  the disputed points are eventually referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states 
as in the united states  we may apply for designation of our products as orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the european union before the application for marketing authorization is made 
orphan drugs in europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits  including a year market exclusivity period for the approved indication  but not for the same drug  unless another applicant can show that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product 
corporate restructuring during june and september  we underwent corporate restructurings to reduce operating costs and to focus resources on the advancement of our therapeutic pipeline through clinical development  resulting in full year restructuring charges of million 
this amount includes an asset impairment charge of million associated with the closure of our pilot manufacturing plant on july  in addition  we also announced a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  primarily composed of preclinical and manufacturing researchers  and additional support staff from within the organization 
the restructuring actions have been substantially completed at december   although payments will continue into completion of sale in may  we completed the sale of our interest in life sciences corporation  a delaware corporation and our majority owned subsidiary  or  to roche diagnostics operations  inc  or rdo 
the sale was accomplished pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated march  by and among roche holdings  inc  and acquisitions  or the merger agreement 
roche holdings  inc subsequently assigned its rights and obligations under the merger agreement to rdo  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of roche holdings  inc  prior to the closing of the merger 
roche holdings  inc and rdo are affiliates of f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
the purchase price paid for by rdo was million in cash  of which rdo paid million in cash and million of which was received from the exercise of stock options following the signing of the merger agreement 
we received million in cash proceeds at closing  and we retain an interest of million in escrowed proceeds  which become distributable to us on august  in july  an adjustment to the purchase price was made based on the closing balance sheet of this purchase price adjustment resulted in us receiving an additional million  which is included in the calculation of the gain on sale of subsidiary on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents our portion of the purchase price for after transaction costs  including the net working capital and net debt adjustment and the amount expected from the escrow  was million 
employees as of december   we had an aggregate of full and part time employees 
our employees include scientists  physicians  accountants and lawyers 
we believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled employees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not based on historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections and the beliefs and assumptions of our management including  without limitation  our expectations regarding results of operations  selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  the sufficiency of our cash for future operations  and the success of our preclinical  clinical and development programs 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  could  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of those terms 
we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward looking statements 
such factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below 
we undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity would likely suffer 
risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur operating losses in the future 
we do not expect to have a meaningful source of recurring revenue in the near future 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we experienced net income of million in principally resulting from the sale of  net losses of million and million in and  respectively  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses as we focus our resources on advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we can not ensure that our existing cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the future 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity  will be sufficient to meet our requirements into we consider our operating expenditures to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in our clinical drug pipeline  we believe that we are building substantial value for our stockholders 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors 
these factors include the number  breadth  progress and results of our research  product development and clinical programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  in licensing and out licensing of pharmaceutical products  and costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products  and may be unable to continue operations 
this result could cause our stockholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 

table of contents our drug candidates are still in development and remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval 
if we are unable to successfully develop and test our drug candidates  we will not be successful 
to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any drug candidates 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our drug candidates successfully 
our most advanced drug candidates are belinostat  which is in multiple phase i and phase ii clinical trials  and cr vcmmae  which is currently in a phase i ii clinical trial 
further development of our other preclinical candidates will be limited in the foreseeable future due to our decision to focus our resources on the development of our clinical development stage oncology therapeutics 
our drug candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy testing and obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
despite our efforts  our drug candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing comparable drugs  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully commercialized 
positive results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in humans during clinical trials  and promising results from early clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to discontinue the development of velafermin after reviewing and evaluating the results of phase ii clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early stage development 
accordingly  the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials for belinostat  cr vcmmae and our other drug candidates may not be predictive of the safety  efficacy or dosing results we may obtain in later stage trials 
we do not expect any of our drug candidates to be commercially available for at least several years 
we may not be able to execute our business strategy if we are unable to enter into alliances with other companies that can provide capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
if we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on favorable terms  our business may not succeed 
we have entered into collaboration arrangements with several companies for the research  development and commercialization of our drug candidates  and we may enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future 
for example  we may enter into alliances with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to jointly develop specific drug candidates and to jointly commercialize them if they are approved 
we may not be successful in entering into any such alliances on favorable terms 
even if we do succeed in securing such alliances  we may not be able to maintain them if  for example  development or approval of a drug candidate is delayed or sales of an approved drug are disappointing 
furthermore  any delay in entering into collaboration agreements could delay the development and commercialization of our drug candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market 
any such delay related to our collaborations could adversely affect our business 
we may also depend on our alliances with other companies to provide substantial additional funding for development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates 
we may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms from these alliances  and if we are not successful in doing so  we may not have sufficient funds to develop a particular drug candidate internally  or to bring drug candidates to market 
failure to bring our drug candidates to market will prevent us from generating sales revenues  and this may substantially harm our business 

table of contents we rely significantly on our collaborative partners to gain access to specified technologies and our business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain strategic alliances 
as part of our business strategy  we have strategic research and development alliances with companies to gain access to specific technologies 
these alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may provide us with access to unique technologies  access to capital  near term revenues  milestone and or royalty payments  and potential profit sharing arrangements 
in return  we provide access to unique technologies  expertise in genomics  and information on the molecular basis of disease  drug targets  and drug candidates 
we currently have strategic alliances with amgen fremont  topotarget  and seattle genetics  in addition to numerous smaller agreements to facilitate these efforts 
in these strategic alliances  either party can terminate the agreement at any time the alliance permits them to or if either party materially breaches the contract 
we may not be able to maintain or expand existing alliances or establish any additional alliances 
if any of our existing collaborators were to breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct activities successfully and in a timely manner  the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs may be delayed or terminated  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and provide other services  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such services 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct some preclinical studies and the clinical trials for our drug candidates  and we rely on third parties such as contract laboratories  contract research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators to design and conduct these studies and our clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over these activities 
accordingly  these third party contractors may not complete activities on schedule  or may not conduct the studies of our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements of our trial design 
to date  we believe our contract research organizations and other similar entities with which we are working have performed well 
however  if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may be required to replace them 
although we believe that there are a number of other third party contractors we could engage to continue these activities  it may result in delays 
accordingly  our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates may be delayed 
in addition  our ability to bring our future products to market depends on the quality and integrity of the data we present to regulatory authorities in order to obtain marketing authorizations 
we cannot guarantee the authenticity or accuracy of data compiled by third parties  nor can we be certain that such data has not been fraudulently generated 
the failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations would materially adversely affect our ability to develop and market new products and implement our strategies 
we currently depend on third party manufacturers to produce our clinical drug supplies and intend to rely upon third party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of any approved drug candidates 
if in the future we manufacture any of our drug candidates  we will be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to establish and maintain these capabilities 
we have relied upon third parties to produce material for clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future 
although we believe that we will not have any material supply issues  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain long term supplies of those materials on acceptable terms  if at all 
we also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our drug candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to arrange for third party manufacturing  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of our drug candidates or market them 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured drug candidates ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  the possibility of breach of a manufacturing agreement by the third party 
table of contents because of factors beyond our control and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or damaging to us 
in addition  the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our drug candidates be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations 
any failure by us or our third party manufacturers to comply with cgmp and or our failure to scale up our manufacturing processes could lead to a delay in  or failure to obtain  regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates 
in addition  such failure could be the basis for action by the fda to withdraw approvals for drug candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the clinical supplies of our antibody  and adc drug candidates and do not currently have relationships for redundant supply or a second source for any of these drug candidates 
to date  our third party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements  but we cannot assure that they will continue to do so 
any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of any approved products 
if for some reason our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed  we may be required to replace them 
although we believe there are a number of potential replacements as our manufacturing processes are not manufacturer specific  we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements 
furthermore  although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a drug candidate to complete the trial  any significant delay in the supply of a drug candidate for an ongoing trial due to the need to replace a third party manufacturer could delay completion of the trial 
we may in the future elect to manufacture certain of our drug candidates in our own manufacturing facilities 
if we do so  we will require substantial additional funds and need to recruit qualified personnel in order to build or lease and operate any manufacturing facilities 
because we have limited experience in developing  commercializing and marketing products  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to do so 
our products in development will require significant research and development and preclinical and clinical testing prior to our submitting any regulatory application for their commercial use 
these activities  even if undertaken without the collaboration of others  will require us to expend significant funds and will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products 
we have limited experience conducting clinical trials 
even if we complete such studies  our ability to commercialize products will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf  and deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these services 
as a result of these possibilities  we may not be able to develop any commercially viable products 
in addition  should we choose to develop pharmaceutical products internally  we will have to make significant investments in pharmaceutical product development  marketing  sales  and regulatory compliance resources and we will have to establish or contract for the manufacture of products under the fda cgmps 
any potential products developed by our licensees will be subject to the same risks 
we do not currently have any marketed products 
if we develop products that can be marketed  we intend to market the products either independently or together with collaborators or strategic partners 
if we decide to market any products independently  we will incur significant additional expenditures and commit significant additional management resources to establish a sales force 
for any products that we market together with partners  we will rely  in whole or in part  on the marketing capabilities of those parties 
we may also contract with other third parties to market certain of our products 
ultimately  we and our partners may not be successful in marketing our products 

table of contents if clinical trials for our drug candidates are prolonged or delayed  we may be unable to commercialize our drug candidates on a timely basis  which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue 
we cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed  ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials  or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials 
any of the following could delay the clinical development of our drug candidates ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  delays in receiving or the inability to obtain required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials  delays in enrolling volunteers and patients into clinical trials  a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers and patients in clinical trials  the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing  inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials  unfavorable fda inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation  serious and unexpected drug related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials  or the placement by the fda of a clinical hold on a trial 
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis will be subject to a number of factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs and longer development times 
in addition  subjects may withdraw from our clinical trials  and thereby impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials 
we  the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the subjects or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons 
we cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will encounter problems during clinical trials which will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend these trials  or which will delay the analysis of data from these trials 
in addition  it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or whether fda regulations  guidance or interpretations will be changed  or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
if we experience any such problems  we may not have the financial resources to continue development of the drug candidate that is affected or the development of any of our other drug candidates 
if a collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us  the development and commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed or terminated 
if any current or future collaborative partner does not devote sufficient time and resources to collaboration arrangements with us  we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  if any existing or future collaboration partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us  the development and commercialization of the affected drug candidate could be delayed  curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the drug candidate on our own 

table of contents much of the potential revenue from our existing and future collaborations will consist of contingent payments  such as payments for achieving development milestones and royalties payable on sales of drugs developed using our technologies 
the milestone and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborator s ability to successfully develop  introduce  market and sell new products 
in addition  our collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under our existing or future collaborations using our technologies  which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive  if any 
in many cases we will not be involved in these processes and accordingly will depend entirely on our collaborators 
our collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products or technologies because they decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints  such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise  limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations  or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment  do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the drug candidate through clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization  decide to pursue a competitive drug candidate developed outside of the collaboration  or cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
if our collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize drug candidates or drugs for any of these reasons  we may not be able to replace the collaboration partner with another partner to develop and commercialize a drug candidate or drugs under the terms of the collaboration 
we may also be unable to obtain a license from such collaboration partner on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
because neither we nor any of our collaborative partners have received marketing approval for any product resulting from our research and development efforts  and may never be able to obtain any such approval  we may not be able to generate any product revenue 
all of the products being developed by our collaborative partners will require additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials  and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
in some cases  the length of time that it takes for our collaborative partners to achieve various regulatory approval milestones may affect the payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreements 
we and our collaborative partners may need to address a number of technical challenges successfully in order to complete development of our drug candidates 
moreover  these drug candidates may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities  or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
if we are unable to obtain us and or foreign regulatory approval  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development  clinical trials  manufacturing and commercialization 
rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions prior to the commercial sale of our drug candidates 
satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly  time consuming  uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays 
it is possible that none of the drug candidates we are developing will obtain marketing approval 
in connection with the clinical trials for belinostat  cr vcmmae and any other drug candidate we may seek to develop in the future  we face risks that the drug candidate may not prove to be efficacious  the drug may not prove to be safe  
table of contents the results may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials  and the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  including approval by the fda 
the time required to complete clinical trials and for the fda and other countries regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years 
our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
we may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the particular drug candidate 
furthermore  any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product 
these limitations may limit the size of the market for the product 
we are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing authorization  pricing and third party reimbursement 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states 
foreign jurisdictions may have different approval procedures than those required by the fda and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates 
even if we obtain regulatory approvals  our drug candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory review 
if we fail to comply with continuing us and applicable foreign regulations  we could lose those approvals  and our business would be seriously harmed 
even if we receive regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop  we will be subject to continuing regulatory review  including the review of clinical results which are reported after our drug candidates become commercially available approved drugs 
since drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained  side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre approval clinical trials 
in addition  the manufacturer  and the manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug candidates  will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the drug from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval  product recalls and seizures  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims 
if we are unable to obtain appropriate levels of insurance  a product liability claim could adversely affect our business 
our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of human therapeutic products 
although we do not currently commercialize any products  claims could be made against us based on the use of our drug candidates in clinical trials 
we currently have clinical trial insurance and will seek to obtain product liability insurance prior to the sales and marketing of any of our drug candidates 
however  our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
furthermore  clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could have a material adverse effect on us 
if a claim is brought against us  we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
furthermore  whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims  we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense  and adverse publicity is likely to result 

table of contents if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates  we may not generate product revenue 
we have no commercial products and we do not currently have an organization for the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
in order to successfully commercialize any drugs that may be approved in the future by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities  we must build our sales and marketing capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
there are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities  as well as entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
for example  developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch 
in addition  to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales  marketing and distribution services  we will have less control over sales of our products  and our future revenues would depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties 
if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable 
if physicians  patients and third party payors do not accept our future drugs  we may be unable to generate significant revenue  if any 
even if belinostat  cr vcmmae or any other drug candidates we may develop or acquire in the future obtain regulatory approval  they may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients and health care payors 
physicians may elect not to recommend these drugs for a variety of reasons including timing of market introduction of competitive drugs  lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs  lack of cost effectiveness  lack of availability of reimbursement from third party payors  convenience and ease of administration  prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods  and ineffective marketing and distribution support 
if our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance  we would not be able to generate sufficient revenue from product sales to maintain or grow our business 
if third party payors do not adequately reimburse customers for any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing  they might not be purchased or used  and our revenues and profits will not develop or increase 
our revenues and profits will depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third party payors  both in the united states and in foreign markets 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend upon a number of factors  including the third party payor s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan  safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 

table of contents obtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement 
even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement  the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or comparable authority 
moreover  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs 
interim payments for new products  if applicable  may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent 
reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used  may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed  may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services  and may reflect budgetary constraints and or imperfections in medicare  medicaid or other data used to calculate these rates 
net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs or by any future relaxation of laws that restrict imports of certain medical products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the united states 
there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  federal and state proposals to constrain expenditures for medical products and services  which may affect payments for our products 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  frequently change product descriptors  coverage policies  product and service codes  payment methodologies and reimbursement values 
third party payors often follow medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates  and both cms and other third party payors may have sufficient market power to demand significant price reductions 
due in part to actions by third party payors  the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward containing or reducing costs through various means  including lowering reimbursement rates  limiting therapeutic class coverage and negotiating reduced payment schedules with service providers for drug products 
our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from government funded and private payors for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our overall financial condition 
we depend on attracting and retaining key employees 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff 
our future success will depend in part on the continued services of our key management and scientific personnel 
the loss of services of any of these personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have entered into employment agreements with all of the principal members of our senior management team 
our future success will also depend in part on our ability to attract  hire  and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially  adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors 
we have relationships with collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors at academic and other institutions that conduct research or provide consulting services at our request 
these collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors are not our employees 
substantially all of our collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors are employed by employers other than us and may have commitments to  or collaboration  consulting  or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration  consulting agreements  and advisory agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
our ability to explore and validate biological activity of therapeutic candidates and commercialize products based on these discoveries may depend  in part  on continued collaborations with researchers at academic and other institutions 
we may not be able to negotiate additional acceptable collaborations with collaborators  consultants  or scientific advisors at academic and other institutions 

table of contents our academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which could compete with us 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and of the results of studies 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with every academic collaboration  consulting  or advisory arrangement  and any unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further  any such collaborator  consultant or advisor may enter into an employment agreement or consulting arrangement with one of our competitors 
competition in our field is intense and likely to increase 
we are subject to significant competition in the development and commercialization of new drugs from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials  or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 
we are aware of specific companies that are developing hdac inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer that may be competitive with ours 
with respect to our hdac inhibitor  belinostat  merck co  inc recently received fda approval to market zolinza  or vorinostat  the first hdac inhibitor approved for use in the us  for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
bayer schering pharma ag  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  methylgene  inc  and novartis pharma ag are also currently evaluating hdac inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers  and in combinations with other chemotherapies  that are similar to approaches and indications we are pursuing 
in addition  many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in research and development for the treatment of cancer from which we may face intense competition 
we expect belinostat to compete on the basis of efficacy  routes of administration  and potentially safety and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
if we do not obtain adequate intellectual property protection  we may not be able to prevent our competitors from commercializing our discoveries 
our business and competitive position depends on our ability to protect our products and processes  including obtaining patent protection on genes and proteins for which we or our collaborators discover utility  and on products  methods and services based on such discoveries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
the law relating to the scope of patent claims in the technology fields in which we operate is evolving  and the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
furthermore  even if patents are issued to us  there can be no assurance that others will not develop alternative technologies or design around the patented technologies developed by us 
therefore  our patent applications may not protect our products  processes  and technologies for at least the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide us with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 

table of contents the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability  nor does it provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others 
a patent could be challenged by litigation and  if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to the patent holder  competitors could be free to use the subject matter covered by the patent 
the invalidation of key patents owned by or licensed to us or the non approval of pending patent applications could increase competition and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  also may be necessary to enforce our patent and proprietary rights and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
we may participate in interference proceedings that may in the future be declared by the uspto to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us 
the outcome of any such litigation or interference proceeding might not be favorable to us  and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require or  even if obtainable  such technology may not be available at a reasonable cost 
if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to obtain a license  pay damages  and or cease the commercialization of our technology 
we believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that the commercialization of our technology could infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  others may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering genes or gene products or antibodies against the gene products that are similar or identical to our products 
any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications  and may result in the issuance of patents to others that could be infringed by our products or processes 
a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as the antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases  generic antibody claims are being issued by the uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims to proteins as therapeutics  to all antibodies against a protein  and to methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and patents including such claims have issued and may continue to issue 
such patents may prevent us from commercializing some products or processes or  if licenses under the patents are made available  may make the royalty burden on these products and processes so high as to prevent commercial success 
in addition  we have sought and intend to continue to seek patent protection for novel uses for genes and proteins and therapeutic antibodies that may have been patented by third parties 
in such cases  we would need a license from the holder of the patent with respect to such gene or protein in order to make  use  or sell such gene or protein for such use 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any legal action against us or our collaborators for patent infringement relating to our products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes  or could enjoin us from continuing to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we become involved in such litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our security measures will protect our confidential information and proprietary technologies 
we rely upon trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information that is not the subject matter for which patent protection is being sought 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary technologies  processes  information systems  and data and continue to explore ways to enhance such 
table of contents security 
such measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
while we require employees  academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur proprietary information could be disclosed  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets  technology  or disclose such information  or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
if the security of our confidential information is breached  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon our ability to license technologies 
we may have to acquire or license certain components of our technologies or products from third parties 
we may not be able to acquire from third parties or develop new technologies  either alone or with others 
we may not be able to acquire licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
failure to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety  our business could be adversely affected 
our research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for resulting damages  which could be substantial 
we are also subject to numerous environmental  health and workplace safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
although we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we generate  we do not currently maintain any environmental liability or toxic tort claim insurance coverage to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with  and substantial fines or penalties if we violate  any of these laws or regulations 

table of contents risks related to our financial results we have a large amount of convertible debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of december   we had total debt of million which is due in february  and for the year ended december   we had a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million 
a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements 
the following table shows  as of december   the remaining aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the years listed in millions year aggregate interest total our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
we will likely need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our funding requirements into however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
to the extent that we need to obtain additional funding  the amount of additional capital we would need to raise would depend on many factors  including the number  breadth  and progress of our research  product development  and clinical programs  our ability to establish and maintain ongoing and future potential strategic collaborations  the progress of our collaborators  our costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  and the extent to which rdo makes successful claims for indemnification under the merger agreement relating to the sale of 
table of contents we expect that we would raise any additional capital we require through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
the relinquishing of rights or granting of licenses on unfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace in general  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
if the proceeds we receive from the sale of our stake in are less than anticipated due to indemnification claims against the escrow account  our liquidity may be impaired  and we may be forced to seek alternative sources of financing sooner than anticipated 
we expect to use the proceeds we receive from the sale of our stake in to make further investments in our clinical drug pipeline  however  as described in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  million of the total sale proceeds to stockholders has been placed in an escrow account in order to secure certain indemnification rights of rdo and its affiliates 
our portion of the million escrow fund totals million which includes interest 
under the merger agreement  roche is currently entitled to indemnification for damages incurred by rdo  and certain other rdo affiliates upon the occurrence of certain events  including breaches of representations  warranties or covenants made by in the merger agreement  and costs incurred by the indemnified parties in connection with the sale of that were not previously taken into account in determining the price paid by rdo for if rdo makes a successful claim for indemnification due to one or more of these reasons  the amount of the escrow account that is available for distribution to us and other stockholders at the end of the month escrow period will be reduced or eliminated 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated greatly and may continue to do so 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
we expect that losses will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the nature  pricing  and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators and customers  our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  acquisition  licensing  and other costs related to our operations  losses and expenses related to our investments  regulatory developments  regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  changes in intellectual property laws that affect our patent rights  
table of contents payments of milestones  license fees  or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may enter 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies or assets 
we have a diversified portfolio of investments  of which of our debt investments at december  were invested in us treasuries and mortgage backed securities that are sponsored by the us government 
additionally  we have of our investment portfolio in asset backed securities which consist of auto  credit card and equipment loans all with aaa ratings by moody s and of our investment portfolio in mortgage backed securities which are all sponsored by the us government 
our fixed rate debt investments comply with our policy of investing in only investment grade debt instruments 
the ability for the debt to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company or assets 
should the underlying company or assets suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so 
for example  during the fiscal year  the closing price of our stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall 
these factors include variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of clinical results  technological innovations  or new products by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or new pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in our industry  announcement by the government or other agencies regarding the economic health of the united states and the rest of the world  the hiring or departure of key personnel  changes in market valuations of companies within the biotechnology industry  and changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by financial analysts 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global market if our stock price continues to trade below per share 
on january   we received notification from the nasdaq stock market llc  or nasdaq  indicating that we are not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule a  or the rule  because the closing bid price per share for the our common stock had been below per share  or the minimum bid price requirement  for consecutive business days 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule e  we were provided calendar days  or until july   to regain compliance 
to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  the closing bid price of our common stock must remain at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
if we do not regain compliance with the rule by july   we can apply to list our common stock on the nasdaq capital 
table of contents market and nasdaq will determine whether we meet the nasdaq capital market initial listing criteria as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c  except for the minimum bid price requirement 
if we meet the nasdaq capital market initial listing criteria  nasdaq will notify us that we have been granted an additional calendar days to come into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if we do not meet the initial listing criteria  nasdaq will provide us with written notification that our common stock will be delisted 
at that time we would be permitted to appeal nasdaq s determination to delist our common stock to a nasdaq listings qualifications panel 
we will seek to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within the day cure period and are considering alternatives to address compliance with the continued listing standards of the nasdaq global market 
delisting from the nasdaq global market could have an adverse effect on our business and on the trading of our common stock 
if a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq stock market were to occur  our common stock would trade on the otc bulletin board or on the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets  and our stock price  as well as the liquidity of our common stock  may be adversely impacted as a result 
we have significant leverage as a result of the sale of our debt in in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated notes due  we incurred million of indebtedness 
in addition  in march  the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional million of convertible subordinated notes due in during  we repurchased a total of million of our convertible subordinated debentures due february  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
as a result of the remaining indebtedness  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain further financing for working capital  acquisitions  or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which may be subject to the financial  business  and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
there are no restrictive covenants in our indentures relating to our ability to incur future indebtedness 
the indentures governing our convertible debt due in do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of liens  or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries 
we may therefore incur additional debt  including secured indebtedness senior to these notes 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings  or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  we may have to delay or curtail our research and development programs 
the level of our indebtedness among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  or other purposes  
table of contents limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our ability to repurchase notes  if required  with cash upon a change in control or fundamental change may be limited 
in certain circumstances involving a change of control or fundamental change  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due february we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or would be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the notes 
our ability to repurchase the notes in such event may be limited by law  by the indenture  and by such indebtedness and agreements as may be entered into  replaced  supplemented  or amended from time to time 
securities we issue to fund our operations could cause dilution to our stockholders ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through a public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights with priority over our common stock 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to us or our existing stockholders  if at all 
any conversion of our convertible debt into shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders 
the conversion price of our convertible debt due in february is approximately per share 
we may effect future repurchases of our convertible debentures due in february  which may adversely affect our liquidity 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase or refinance a portion of our outstanding convertible debentures that mature on february  any repurchases might occur through cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors
