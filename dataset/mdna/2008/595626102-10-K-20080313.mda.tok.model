retail operations consist of franchised and company operated midas shops in north america and licensed midas shops in other countries 
supply chain activities include providing value added merchandising services to franchisees in which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products and equipment directly to midas shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas shops in north america 
the midas business transformation midas retail locations historically operated as under car specialists focused on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas retail shop revenues in the us market 
as automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems in the mid s  the average life of an original equipment exhaust system began to increase from three years to over years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s  midas core exhaust replacement business began to experience sustained revenue declines 
this trend  combined with the increased technological complexity and durability of newer vehicles  has changed the nature of automotive repairs 
today  the services performed over the lifetime of a vehicle are more likely to be maintenance services and light repair work 

table of contents in response to these trends  the company began to broaden its service menu in  with the purpose of transforming itself from an under car specialist to a full service automotive repair and maintenance provider  leveraging midas strong brand name and nationwide presence 
in addition to managing the global midas retail system  the company historically distributed brake  shock  strut and other automotive parts to its dealers in north america through a network of automotive parts warehouses 
the company also manufactured and distributed exhaust products and equipment to midas dealers and independent exhaust distributors 
however  the dramatic decline in the retail exhaust business coupled with the broadening services menu and the emergence of quick delivery parts suppliers prompted retail auto service providers  including midas dealers  to gradually reduce their investments in parts inventories within their shops  preferring to source required auto parts only at the time the part was needed for a specific customer 
as a result of these trends  the company s revenue from the wholesale distribution of parts declined and midas wholesale distribution and exhaust manufacturing operations became unprofitable 
in fiscal  midas management redirected the company s strategic focus towards the core midas retail operations 
during that year  the company shut down its network of parts distribution warehouses and outsourced parts distribution on behalf of midas dealers in the us and canada 
in fiscal  the company ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing facility and began the process of liquidating all assets related to its exhaust manufacturing and distribution operation 
in the first quarter of fiscal  midas closed its last distribution facility  an exhaust warehouse in chicago  illinois 
the midas business transformation  and the resulting changes to the way the company does business  continued in as the company closed six unprofitable company operated shops and re franchised three shops 
the company recorded charges of approximately million in connection with these actions 
additionally  in connection with midas ongoing retail transformation  the company began the rollout of a major update to its retail shop image 
the new image program incorporates changes to internal shop appearance and merchandising  as well as a significant redesign of the midas shop fa ade 
midas management believes the new image will better showcase the company s expansion into new services  enhance efforts to educate customers and significantly increase the visibility and curb appeal of the typical midas shop 
in order to encourage midas dealers to adopt this new image  the company offered to provide a subsidy of up to  per shop for those franchisees who agreed to adopt the program prior to the end of fiscal currently  over  us locations have converted to the new image with an additional to shops committed to completing the conversion program in fiscal the subsidy offer has been extended through the end of fiscal for franchisees in canada 
approximately million in business transformation costs were recorded in fiscal and an additional million were recorded in fiscal in connection with this program 
the company expects to record additional business transformation costs during fiscal in connection with the remaining us locations that had committed to the program prior to the end of fiscal  as well as for the canadian franchisees that convert during midas believes the total additional charges for franchised locations will be approximately million 
the implementation of the company s strategic initiatives has resulted in the company recording substantial business transformation charges to reflect the write down of assets  the disposition of lease agreements  severance costs  and other related expenses 
the charges recorded in connection with the company s business transformation process in fiscal years  and are summarized in the following table in millions fiscal year exit from exhaust manufacturing retail image update redesign of the wholesale distribution network rationalization of company operated shops total business transformation charges 
table of contents additional information regarding each of the business transformation costs listed in the above summary is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
the implementation of these business transformation initiatives has had the effect of substantially lowering overall company revenues and expenses in fiscal and compared to historical periods 
with the company s exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution completed  midas is focused on the profitable growth of the midas retail system 
management is committed to leveraging the strong midas brand and the broad geographic presence of the midas system towards establishing midas as the pre eminent full service automotive repair and maintenance network 
building shareholder value in the future with the company s business transformation essentially complete  management is focused on building shareholder value through the profitable growth of the company 
the first priority is building shareholder value through the profitable growth of the midas retail system in north america  which includes both comparable shop sales growth at existing midas locations and growth in overall shop count 
in addition  midas management believes that the company s brand name and system management expertise can be leveraged to generate incremental royalty revenue through growth of the midas system around the world  which includes possible expansion into asia 
because the company s franchising business model generates substantial operating cash flow with relatively low ongoing capital investment requirements  the future growth of the midas retail system does not necessarily depend upon the company making significant capital investments or adding significant additional corporate overhead 
midas management also believes that it can create shareholder value by efficiently allocating capital towards complementary franchising business acquisitions and repurchasing the company s stock 
these strategies for creating shareholder value are described in greater detail below 
growth of the midas system in north america the revitalization of the midas retail system in north america has been and continues to be the core focus of the company s strategy 
growing sales at existing midas shops remains the company s most important goal 
midas is focused on transforming the company s relationship with its customers  thereby becoming less dependent upon one time repair transactions and more focused on building long term customer relationships 
to this end  midas has developed and implemented several multi year initiatives 
in fiscal  the company re defined the core services of the midas system to encompass exhaust  brakes and maintenance services 
this significantly expanded the revenue potential of the core midas system business model 
in fiscal  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
the typical midas shop in the us currently derives only of its revenues from tires and related services  but management believes that the typical midas shop can ultimately generate at least of its revenue from the category 
during fiscal  the company rolled out a series of initiatives to enhance the midas system s ability to build revenue from retail maintenance services 
these initiatives included the standardizing of the midas oil change service and vehicle inspection process  providing all customers with factory maintenance schedules and increasing the midas shop s focus and capabilities in fluid exchange services 
as a result  maintenance services have risen to approximately of total shop sales and management believes the growth in maintenance services will continue 
finally  the company has implemented a comprehensive program for increasing revenue from local and national fleet services 
currently  midas generates only of retail revenue in the us from fleet operations 
however  midas management believes the company s nationally respected brand name  wide breadth of services and national presence will enable it to meaningfully grow retail revenues from fleet 
with the new midas system business model established  and the new midas shop image roll out underway  the company believes growth in new midas shop count is possible 
during the past several years  the company 
table of contents has invested in the rebuilding of its franchise development capabilities 
midas management believes that both de novo shop development and conversion of existing independent repair shops including the acquisition and conversion of such shops by the company represent meaningful opportunities for growing the midas system 
global expansion of the midas brand midas currently has licensees in countries outside of the united states and canada 
since the late s  when the company sold its european and australian operations  further development of international markets has not been a significant priority 
nevertheless  midas international licensees have continued to invest in their operations and grow 
midas international shop count has grown every year since  with the international shop count increasing from shops in to shops in  even though the number of countries in which the company operates has not grown during that time 
management believes the midas brand has significant global growth potential 
in europe  midas licensee  norauto group sa of france  currently operates approximately company operated and franchised shops 
norauto owns the rights to the midas name in most european countries and certain countries in south america and africa  but it currently operates in only nine countries 
since it acquired the midas franchise rights in late  norauto has grown the midas net shop count in europe by nearly 
norauto s future plans include shop count growth  through both acquisition and de novo development  and expansion into additional countries within continental europe 
midas licensee in mexico is also expanding its shop count 
midas is seeking licensee partners to expand into new countries 
significantly  the midas brand currently has no licensees in asia 
in february  the company added a new midas licensee in costa rica  which was the first new international license agreement for the midas system since furthermore  in the past year the company evaluated multiple potential partners for expansion into china 
although no definitive plans have been made  the company continues to seek the right partner in order to maximize the opportunity for this important market 
acquisition of complementary franchising operations midas management believes that the company can add significant value for shareholders by acquiring complementary franchising operations 
midas management possesses strong core competencies in both automotive aftermarket services and franchising 
furthermore  the company believes it can successfully manage a substantial increase in shop count  whether through growth of the midas retail system or acquisition of another franchise operation  with limited incremental corporate overhead 
in addition  as of fiscal year end  midas had an approximately million net operating loss nol carryforward 
midas believes it can create value for shareholders by successfully integrating accretive acquisitions that accelerate the utilization of the nol 
given the above described factors  midas has considered  and will continue to consider  potential acquisition candidates 
share repurchases the midas business model generates significant operating cash flow with relatively low ongoing capital investment requirements 
furthermore  the company believes that returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks enhances shareholder value 
as a result  in november  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to million in midas stock 
in may  the board of directors authorized a million increase in the share repurchase program  and in may  the board authorized an additional million increase 
since the inception of this repurchase plan through december   the company has repurchased approximately million in stock  including million repurchased during fiscal 
table of contents the company intends to continue to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending upon market and business conditions

significant comparable shop sales growth in the new categories of tires of  oil of and other non traditional services of  could not offset a decline in brakes and a decline in exhaust

however  the company believes it lost market share in the brake category as intense price competition and a softening economy appear to have driven some consumers to lower priced competitors

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s existing business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from midas on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
a decrease of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of changing midas december  outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing midas outstanding us warranty liability by million 
in fiscal  the company will be changing how the midas warranty obligation will be funded in the united states 
from june through  product royalties received from the company s preferred supply chain vendors were recorded as revenue and substantially offset the cost of warranty claims 
beginning in fiscal  the midas warranty program in the united states will be funded directly by midas franchisees 
the franchisees will be charged a fee for each warranted product sold to customers 
the fee will be charged when the warranty is registered with the company 
the fee billed to dealers will be deferred and will be recognized as revenue when the actual warranty is redeemed and included in warranty expense 
this fee is intended to cover the company s cost of the new warranty program  thus revenues under this program will match expenses and the new warranty program will have no profit or loss impact 
in connection with this change  beginning in midas franchisees in the united states will receive rebates on their purchases from the company s preferred supply chain vendors and the company will no longer receive product royalties on midas dealer purchases in the united states 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis

to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining these rates the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized in net periodic pension cost over a five year period

an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

table of contents midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by asset group 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes down fixed assets to their estimated recovery value 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to reflect the impairment of certain long lived assets related to the manufacturing and distribution of exhaust 
these assets have since been liquidated 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at december  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized
