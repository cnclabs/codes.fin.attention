net sales of all other products  except serial cards and nics  increased by million  or 
net sales of serial cards  a non embedded product  and nics  an embedded product  decreased by million  or 
serial cards are in a mature market that is declining at a rate of approximately per year 
serial cards net sales represented of total net sales for fiscal nics are at the end of their product life cycle and represented less than of our net sales for fiscal net sales increased from to by million  or 
net sales increased million as a result of a full year of product sales related to the acquisition of maxstream which were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  as fiscal net sales only included two months of revenue based on the date of acquisition of july  net sales of all other products  except serial cards and nics  increased by million  or 
net sales of serial cards  which are a non embedded product  and nics  which are an embedded product  decreased by million  or  as serial cards are in a mature market and nics are approaching the end of their product life cycle 
a shift in the customer and product mix has resulted in a slight decrease in our average selling price of our products as we are selling more embedded products as a percentage of total net sales 
embedded products generally have a lower average selling price than non embedded products 
fluctuation in foreign currency rates compared to the prior year s rates in each case had a favorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal  a favorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal and an unfavorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal

our non embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in sales of serial servers  usb connected products and wireless communication adapters and gateways  partially offset by the sales decline of serial cards 
embedded embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of modules including wireless modules increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the remaining increase was due to an increase in design services revenue as a result of the acquisition of spectrum along with an increase in chips and software revenue  partially offset by a slight decline of the nic sales

net sales by distribution channels the following table presents our revenue by distribution channel in millions net sales of net sales direct oem channel distribution channel total company during fiscal  net sales in the direct oem channel decreased due to a decline in net sales in north america and a change in the product mix 
the increase in direct oem channel net sales during fiscal is primarily due to continued enhancement of our product offerings through the acquisitions of rabbit and maxstream  whose customers are primarily oems 
the increase in the distribution channel net sales over the last three fiscal years was primarily due to our continued focus on maintaining our channel strategy  which includes employing additional channel partners and releasing complementary products 
in addition  net sales from our international customers  which are primarily fulfilled through the distribution channel grew faster than our domestic net sales in fiscal

the increase in net sales in north america increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to incremental net sales resulting from the maxstream and rabbit acquisitions  continued market penetration and new customer volume increases 
the increase in international revenue during the past three fiscal years is due primarily to the increase in the european  middle eastern  and african emea locations including the incremental net sales increase of million resulting from the sarian acquisition in fiscal revenue increased in the latin american and asian pacific locations by million in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit compared to the gross margin for was compared to in the increase in gross margin is due to a reduction in the amortization of purchased and core technology  partially offset by a decrease in gross margin due to product mix changes among products within both the embedded and non embedded product groups  including lower gross margins provided by sarian non embedded products

sarian is located in the united kingdom and is a leader in the european wireless router market 
the total purchase price of million including million of cash acquired was for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of sarian

other income  net compared to total other income  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we realized interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily due to a higher average investment balance of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  which was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate

we recorded an income tax benefit as a result of the reversal of the excess tax reserves related to this settlement 
the aforementioned discrete income tax benefits reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal these tax benefits were partially offset by non deductible maxstream acquired in process research and development expense  which increased the effective tax rate in fiscal by percentage points see reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and are lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to the aforementioned income tax benefits and the utilization of income tax credits and exclusions for extraterritorial income in all years and the domestic production activities deduction in all years 
as of september   we have domestic tax credit carryforwards of million the majority of which will expire in we also have foreign tax credit carryforwards at september  of million  the majority of which will expire in we are required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance against those assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on future projected taxable income and the anticipated future reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and therefore no valuation allowance has been established at september  the amount of the net deferred tax assets realized  however  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if our future taxable income projections are not realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in future taxable income is determined

we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect fsp to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded products to our distributors and direct end user oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued revenue recognition continued under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  and we also generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
revenue recognized resulting from such non product sales represented of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for software licenses  professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance  which includes delivery of a final product version and acceptance by the customer 
for post contract customer support and fees associated with technical support  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as service is performed 
unearned post contract customer support and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities to determine if an impairment exists in any of the securities 
sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas defines an impairment as any security where the market value is below the cost basis on a security by security basis 
we review the length of time the security was impaired  the significance of the impairment and market factors affecting the value of the security 
for each impaired security  we then determine whether or not we believe the impairment was other than temporary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million on a bond issued by lehman brothers with a par amount of million 
this impairment reflects the estimated decline in the value of this security precipitated by the bankruptcy of the security s issuer 
in addition  as of september  we have unrealized losses in our marketable securities of million that we determined are not other than temporarily impaired 
the use of different assumptions  applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value of these securities  currently and in the future 
the fair value of our securities could change significantly based on changes in market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 
if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades  we may incur additional impairment charges for other securities in our investment portfolio 
we will continue to monitor the fair value of securities and relevant market conditions and we will record additional impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant such charges 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  inventory and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at september  and  respectively 
identifiable intangible assets purchased proven technology  customer relationships  license agreements  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition  or at cost when not purchased in a business combination 
purchased in process research and development costs ipr d are expensed upon consummation of the related business acquisition 
all other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to thirteen years or based on the pattern in which the asset is consumed 
useful lives for identifiable intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which we expect to derive benefits from the identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of purchased and core technology is presented as a separate component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
amortization of all other acquired identifiable intangible assets is charged to operating expenses as a component of general and administrative expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
we measure impairment loss by utilizing an undiscounted cash flow valuation technique using fair values indicated by the income approach 
impairment losses  if any  would be recorded currently 
to the extent that our undiscounted future cash flows were to decline substantially  such an impairment charge could result 
no impairment was identified during fiscal there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made  our consolidated results of operations or financial position could be materially impacted 
we also periodically evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets and the method of depreciation or amortization 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and is not amortized 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually which may result in a charge to operations if the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is reported declines 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the fair value of goodwill 
significant assumptions include our estimates of future cash flows and the cost of capital 
these and other estimates are based upon information that we use to prepare our annual and five year business plan projections 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made  our consolidated results of operations or financial position could be materially impacted 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june   on our one reporting unit 
based on our analysis  we conclude that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount and therefore goodwill is not considered impaired 
when the assessment was performed  our market capitalization  which is an indicator of fair value  was below the carrying value of our reporting unit due to significant declines in our stock price during the year 
however  an estimated control premium was also used in our determination of fair value 
the control premium represents the amount an investor would pay  over and above market capitalization  in order to obtain a controlling interest in a company 
therefore  the fair value of our reporting unit was measured using our market capitalization as of june   plus a control premium in a range of to 
the estimated control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
the control premium used in our determination of fair value is subject to management judgment  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to our income tax balances that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations

as a result of our adoption of fin  we recognized an increase in our existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million and additional deferred tax assets of million  with an offsetting cumulative effect adjustment resulting in a decrease to the opening balance of retained earnings of million 
at the adoption date  we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of million 
in conjunction with our adoption of fin  we reclassified million of unrecognized tax benefits to a long term liability as we do not expect significant payments to occur over the next months 
if all of our unrecognized tax benefits were recognized  approximately million would impact our effective tax rate before the benefit recognized related to corresponding deferred tax assets 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
during the year ended september   we recognized million in interest and penalties 
as of september   we have accrued million in interest and penalties on our consolidated balance sheet

certain open tax years are expected to close in future years that may result in adjustments to our income tax balances in those years that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we are no longer subject to income tax examination for taxable years prior to fiscal and in the case of us federal and non us income tax authorities  respectively  and for tax years generally before fiscal  in the case of state taxing authorities  consisting primarily of minnesota and california

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities actually realized could be impacted by differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in estimated future taxable income is determined 
we have determined that a valuation allowance is not required as of september  stock based compensation effective october   we adopted fasb statement no

under this statement  we must measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
this cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide the service usually the vesting

see note to our consolidated financial statements self insured liabilities we are self insured and retain a significant portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and dental liability claims 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported 
through various methods  including data received from our health claims administrator and our analysis of historical trends  we estimate the costs of these risks 
we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided 
we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks 
warranties in general  we warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service 
the warranty periods range from days to five years from the date of receipt 
we have the option to repair or replace products we deem defective due to material or workmanship 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized based upon an estimated average per unit repair or replacement cost applied to the estimated number of units under warranty 
these estimates are based upon historical warranty incidents and are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of the warranty accrual 
the product warranty accrual was million for each of the years ended september  and and million for the year ended september  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk as all investments are currently held to maturity and the majority of our investments mature in less than a year 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds or japanese yen and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we have not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during  the average monthly exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar increased by approximately from to  the average monthly exchange rate for the british pound to the us dollar increased approximately from to and the average monthly exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar increased by approximately from 
to 
a change from the average exchange rate for the euro  british pound and yen to the us dollar would have resulted in a increase or decrease in annual net sales and a increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
the above analysis does not take into consideration any pricing adjustments we may need to consider in response to changes in the exchange rate 
credit risk we have some exposure to credit risk related to our accounts receivable portfolio 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through regular monitoring of customer financial status  credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment 
investments are made in accordance with our investment policy and consist of commercial paper and corporate bonds 
we may have some exposure related to the fair value of our securities  which could change significantly based on changes in market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 
if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades  we may incur additional impairment charges for other securities in our investment portfolio
