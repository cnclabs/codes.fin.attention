item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
although the company s management has concluded that its system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of february   there can be no assurance that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting would require management and or the company s independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate the company s system of internal controls as ineffective 
this in turn could lead to a loss of public confidence  which could adversely affect the company s business and the price of its common stock 
corporate governance in recent years  the nasdaq global select market  on which the company s common stock is listed  has adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased  and may continue to increase  the scope  complexity and cost of the company s corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect the company  and in a worst case  result in the delisting of its stock 
as a result of these rules  the company s board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other corporate officers could also face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and officers  which would adversely affect its business 
further  these developments could affect the company s ability to secure desired levels of directors and officers liability insurance  requiring the company to accept reduced insurance coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
changes in accounting for equity compensation the company has historically used stock options and sars as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of its stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles known as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r requiring a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives which became effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to the extent that this or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  the company may consider changes to its equity compensation strategy 
to the extent that such changes might limit the company s use of equity based compensation  it might become more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
environmental regulation environmental regulations and standards are established worldwide to control discharges  emissions  and solid wastes from manufacturing processes 
within the united states  federal  state and local agencies establish these regulations 
outside of the united states  individual countries and local governments establish their own individual standards 
the company believes that its activities conform to present environmental regulations and historically the effects of this compliance have not had a material effect on the company s capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
future environmental compliance requirements  as well as amendments to or the adoption of new environmental regulations or the occurrence of an unforeseen circumstance could subject the company to fines or require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
in addition  many of the company s customers belong to trade groups or other similar bodies that are creating their own private governance  health  safety and environmental standards 
some of these customers are mandating that the company comply with these standards as a condition to selling product to these customers 
the company s sales and profitability may suffer it is unable to satisfy these private standards  or if complying with these standards imposes significant costs on the company

item legal proceedings from time to time as a normal consequence of doing business  various claims and litigation may be asserted or commenced against the company 
in particular  the company in the ordinary course of business may receive claims that its products infringe the intellectual property of third parties  or that customers have suffered damage as a result of defective products allegedly supplied by the company 
due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims  the company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters  which could subject the company to significant liability for damages and or invalidate its proprietary rights 
any lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention  and an adverse outcome of any significant matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved

table of contents description of business standard microsystems corporation the company or smsc designs and sells a wide variety of silicon based integrated circuits that are primarily utilizing analog or mixed signal technologies 
the company s integrated circuits and systems provide a wide variety of signal processing attributes that are incorporated by its globally diverse customers into a wide variety of end products in the consumer electronics infotainment  the mobile desktop pc  and industrial other markets 
these products generally provide connectivity  networking  or input output control solutions for a variety of high speed communication  computer and related peripheral  consumer electronics  industrial control systems or auto infotainment applications 
the market for these solutions is increasingly diverse  and the company s various technologies are increasingly used in various combinations and in alternative applications 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and revenues and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may be subject from time to time to short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results  as it allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that smsc sells through distribution channels  and it better focuses the company on end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from its distributors 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as report the quantities of the company s products that are still in their inventories 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect reported operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  as title passes upon delivery  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market  and are reviewed for product obsolescence and impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
the company often receives orders from customers and distributors requesting delivery of product on relatively short notice and with 
table of contents lead times that are shorter than the manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to its customers  the company builds and stocks a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may or may not materialize 
historically  forecasts of customer demand  particularly at a part number level  are challenging and can vary significantly from actual future demand 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  customers may be allowed to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
these dynamics create risks that the company may forecast incorrectly and consequently produce excess or insufficient inventories 
when it is determined that specific inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to costs of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs may be required in future periods relating to inventory on hand as of any reported balance sheet 
stock based compensation the company has several stock based compensation plans in effect under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards rsas and stock appreciation rights sars are granted to employees and directors 
stock options and sars are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
new shares are issued in settling stock option exercises and restricted stock awards 
effective march  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature 
in march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
the company considered the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas r 
the company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
accordingly  prior periods have not been revised to reflect the impact of sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for fiscal year includes i compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no

r 
in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r  the company elected the long form method in determining our additional paid in capital pool of windfall benefits and the graded vesting method to amortize compensation expense over the service period 
the estimated value of the company s stock based awards including stock options  restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards respective requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis 
share based compensation recognized in fiscal and fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  as well as pro forma disclosures according to the original provisions of sfas no 
for periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  use the black scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of options and sars granted 
the black scholes model requires certain assumptions  judgements and estimates by the company to determine fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life 
the company based the expected volatility on historical volatility 
additionally  the company 
table of contents based the expected life of options  rsas and sars granted on an actuarial model 
share based compensation related to rsas is calculated based on the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
there were no dividends expected to be paid on the company s common stock over the expected lives estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company regularly performs credit evaluations consisting primarily of reviews of its customers financial condition  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of an individual customer or group of customers deteriorates  resulting in such customers inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if at the time of such evaluation the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when an event or circumstance occurs indicating a possible impairment in value 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  during which no impairment in value was identified 
unless an indicator of impairment is identified earlier  the next goodwill impairment review will be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal marketable and non marketable long term equity investments are also monitored for indications of impairment in value 
the company records an impairment charge against these investments when the investment is judged to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
judgments regarding the value of non marketable equity investments are subjective and dependent upon management s assessment of the performance of the investee and its prospects for future success 
as of february   the company had no significant long term equity investments 
income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effects of differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities as well as tax attributes such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of a valuation allowance of million and million of deferred tax liabilities 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient future taxable income for purposes of realizing its deferred tax assets include declines in sales and revenues or gross profit  increased competition and loss of market share  delays in product availability  and technological obsolescence 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no

fin  which for smsc  became effective as of march  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable  or adjustments to deferred taxes  or both 
the company adopted fin on march  as a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement  the company recognized million of previously unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings 
at adoption the company s total unrecognized tax benefits was stated at million which included million of interest 
legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future profitability

business acquisition on march   smsc announced the acquisition of oasis siliconsystems holding ag oasis  a leading provider of media oriented systems transport most or most technology  serving a top tier customer base of leading automakers and automotive suppliers 
oasis infotainment networking technology has been deployed by many european luxury and mid market car brands  including audi  bmw  daimler  land rover  porsche  saab and volvo and more recently  by asian vehicle manufacturers 
the initial cost of the acquisition at march  was approximately million  including approximately million of cash  million shares of smsc common stock  valued at million  and an estimated million of direct acquisition costs  including legal  banking  accounting and valuation fees 
included with the net assets acquired from oasis were approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  therefore smsc s initial net cash outlay for the transaction  including transaction costs  was approximately million 
the terms of the agreement also provided the former oasis shareholders the opportunity to earn up to million of additional consideration  based upon achieving certain fiscal performance goals  the amount earned of which was indeterminable until february  based upon fiscal performance and per the computation completed and submitted on april   the former oasis shareholders earned approximately million of additional consideration  consisting of approximately million shares of smsc common stock valued for accounting purposes as of may  at million  and approximately million of cash  all of which was tendered and paid during the first quarter of fiscal smsc s existing cash balances were used to fund the cash portion of the additional consideration 
the fair value of the shares tendered was approximately million less at the settlement date than had been estimated as of february   resulting in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal refer to part iv item a i financial statements note  for additional information on the final computation and settlement of this obligation 
results of operations fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  sales and revenues the company s sales and revenues for fiscal were million  consisting of million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues  compared to fiscal sales and revenues of million  consisting of million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues 
this increase for the company as a whole came from modest increases in mobile computing  networking  usb and automotive products 
during the calendar year of the company executed a strategy to reduce less profitable sales  by disengaging from sales efforts to certain customers and markets  and by declining to accept some lower margin business 

table of contents intellectual property revenues include million and million in fiscal and  respectively  received from intel corporation pursuant to the terms of a september business agreement 
intellectual property revenues for fiscal include payments under this agreement of million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters 
fiscal results include the payments of million in the first  second and third quarters and million in the fourth quarter

intellectual property revenues received from intel are included within the united states 
the company expects international shipments to asia to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales and revenues for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of the world s high technology manufacturing and assembly activity occurs in asia  where many of the company s significant customers conduct business 
in addition  many of the company s customers are establishing new lower cost operations in china  and a growing amount of the company s shipments are now being made to that country 
costs of goods sold costs of goods sold include the purchase cost of finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries including mask and tooling costs  costs of assembly  packaging and mechanical and electrical testing  manufacturing overhead  quality assurance and other support overhead including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  royalties paid to developers of intellectual property incorporated into the company s products  and adjustments for excess  slow moving or obsolete inventories 
costs of goods sold for fiscal were million  or of sales and revenues  compared to million  or of sales and revenues  in fiscal excluding intellectual property revenues  costs of goods sold were of product sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in costs of goods sold on a percentage basis in the current year period compared to the prior year results has resulted primarily from the company s strategy  beginning in the latter half of fiscal  to discontinue sales of certain lower profit generating legacy computing products  as well as successfully achieving material cost savings and production and test efficiencies 
the company routinely assesses its stock positions and evaluates for potential defective  excess or obsolete inventory 
lower of cost or market lcm adjustments are made as required 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million of net lcm adjustments  as compared with million in fiscal the reduction in net lcm charges is primarily attributable to a reduction in quality related issues  which were somewhat higher than usual in fiscal  as the company has recently increased its investment in quality assurance capabilities and can now more closely monitor and control quality performance at the fabless supply chain partner level

inventory and other purchase obligations include purchase commitments for processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
the company depends entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture its silicon wafers and provide assembly services  as well as for certain of its test services 
due to the length of subcontractor lead times  the company orders these materials and services well in advance  and generally expects to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
for purposes of the preceding table  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company cannot cancel these obligations without incurring cost 
non cancelable purchase orders for manufacturing requirements are typically fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons  generally three months or less 
the company has additional purchase orders  not included within the table  that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the company has considered in the past  and will continue to consider  various possible transactions to secure necessary foundry manufacturing capacity  including equity investments in  prepayments to  or deposits with foundries  in exchange for guaranteed capacity or other arrangements which address the company s manufacturing requirements 
the company may also consider utilizing cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its investment portfolio ie with respect to interest income 
the primary objective of smsc s investment portfolio management is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  investments are placed with high credit quality issuers and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer is limited 
as of february   the company s million of long term investments consisted primarily of investments in corporate  government and municipal obligations with maturities of between three and twelve months at acquisition 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at february   the company estimates that the fair values of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
equity price risk the company is not exposed to any equity significant price risks at february  
table of contents foreign currency risk the company has international sales and expenditures and is  therefore  subject to certain foreign currency rate exposures  principally the euro and japanese yen 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  most of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with its foundry  test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
from time to time  the company s foreign operating subsidiaries  smsc japan and smsc europe  have entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize the exposure of their us dollar denominated transactions  assets and liabilities to currency exchange rate risk 
gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains or losses recorded for statutory purposes from the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities from us dollars into local currencies 
as of february   the company s wholly owned subsidiary in japan had two forward contracts initiated in january for the delivery of million in exchange for yen  to cover scheduled payments on intercompany debt due the us parent company 
although these contracts were not formally designated as hedges  they were intended to lock in the settlement rate on the underlying obligations and  as such  effectively mitigate the currency exposure on this intercompany debt 
these were the only such contracts initiated during fiscal as of february  and during the fiscal year then ended  there were no such contracts outstanding 
the company has never received a cash dividend repatriation of cash from smsc japan 
commodity price risk precious metals are routinely used in the manufacture of our products 
supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted  or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such commodities 
in the latter part of fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter  the price of gold increased precipitously  and certain of our supply chain partners assessed surcharges to compensate for the resultant increase in manufacturing costs 
while the company is currently evaluating opportunities to control the risk of similar  increases in commodities related costs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully safeguard against potential short term and long term commodities price fluctuations
