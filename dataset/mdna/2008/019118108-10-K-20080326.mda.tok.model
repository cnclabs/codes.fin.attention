allied  the parent company  provides management  business development and related services to its subsidiaries and has no operating activities 
liquidity and capital resources as described further below  the company encountered serious liquidity difficulties in and the liquidity position improved markedly in the third and fourth quarters of the company expects to have some liquidity challenges in the first half of as mecar begins to perform on its increased backlog but anticipates that these challenges will decrease in the second half of as mecar begins to receive payment on its first deliveries from its increased backlog 
as described below  mecar continues working on refinancing of its credit facility 
further  the company will consider its options including raising additional capital or the disposition of another subsidiary to be in a position to satisfy a potential put of its senior secured convertible notes which may be made in december or january  as discussed below 
the company faced serious liquidity challenges in mainly resulting from the reduction of revenues and significant operating losses at mecar  the financing costs associated with registration delay penalties and interest premiums paid to the holders of its convertible notes  legal and restructuring costs associated with alleged events of default with the convertible note holders and with the issuance of new convertible notes in june and july  operational restructuring activities at mecar and nsm to reduce the fixed cost base of those operations  and the funding of continuing operating losses at several of the company s smaller us based subsidiaries 
the downturn in the mecar business resulted from lack of replenishment orders from mecar s largest customer after the completion of a large multi year contract in early in fiscal year and in the first nine months of  mecar incurred significant operating losses and used its cash balances and credit facilities to fund these losses 
the company managed its initial liquidity issues in through a combination of a restructuring of its convertible notes and sales of certain subsidiaries 
in july  mecar received substantial replenishment contracts from several customers  which required a working capital investment in the second half of it was followed by additional orders received by mecar throughout the balance of and early and increased orders received by gms and nsm in the fourth quarter of the increase in orders resulted in the company recording net income from continuing operations of for the fourth quarter of the company restructured its convertible notes in june and july in connection with the restructuring  the note holders withdrew their allegation of events of default and purchased an additional  of convertible notes 
at year end  mecar obtained an additional loan from a belgian regional agency 
the company sold each of its seaspace and the vsk group subsidiaries in seaspace generated net proceeds of while the sale of the vsk group generated net proceeds of  after repayment of  to the convertible note holders  pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes 
as a result of these actions  the company ended with unrestricted cash of  outlook for mecar has begun to work on the substantial backlog it accumulated in the second half of further  mecar has obtained substantial additional orders in early  including a multiyear contract for  as a result  the company expects to report a profit in notwithstanding the healthy cash position at the end of  the company expects liquidity challenges in as it executes on its backlog 
mecar expects to make substantial shipments in the second and third quarters of and payment for these shipments will not be received until the third and fourth quarters of this situation is also impacted by the status of the mecar credit facility 
based on the timing of purchases and the building of inventory  cash availability is expected to be at its lowest point in may and august of during  as mecar worked to secure its new long term sales contract and reduce its fixed cost base  the subsidiary was also working on restructuring its credit facility 
mecar has failed to be in compliance with annual covenant requirements for the facility at december   and although mecar did obtain debt waivers for and early in  the company committed to mecar s banking group that it would look to completely refinance the credit facility by march  in the fourth quarter of  the company faced difficulties refinancing mecar as a result of a tight credit market  political issues associated with financing ammunition manufacturers in europe  and the lack of profitable historical results reported by mecar prior to the fourth quarter of in january and february of  the banking group notified mecar that it would hold mecar to its commitment to refinance the facility in early the company has had extensive discussions with mecar s banking group in an effort to persuade them to continue to finance mecar s operations 
a tentative agreement has been reached to extend and expand the credit facility until november  the finalization of the agreement is subject to local government support that will guarantee an additional portion of mecar s performance bonds and advance payment guarantees from april through november this additional guarantee will reduce the required restricted cash balances at mecar and allow the company to fund mecar through it critical working capital expansion period 
the company s cash projections for show that the company  particularly mecar  should be able to generate cash from operations in in order for mecar to be able to generate this cash  mecar must secure its credit facility  at least at its current level as described in note i of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to securing the credit facility  mecar will require additional cash in the first half of in order to expand its working capital as it performs on its backlog 
in addition  the terms of the senior secured convertible notes  limit the additional secured debt the company can incur with preference to the convertible notes 
at december   the company had approximately  of additional availability that could be borrowed against on a secured basis 
the company believes it will be able to finance mecar s operations  in addition to the other operations  if the credit facility is secured for remainder of at the current levels 
the company s projections show that  if the credit facility is secured until november   the company should be able to manage through its liquidity issues and repay mecar s cash line and debt obligations 
as described in note k of the consolidated financial statements  the senior secured convertible notes have a put feature that allows the holders to put the notes back to the company on december  or january  the current principal balance outstanding on these notes is  the company is currently evaluating strategic alternatives and may look to sell another of its subsidiaries to ensure it has the funds available to meet this put feature 
the put feature requires the holders of the senior convertible notes to provide at least days notice of intent to enforce this feature 
at december   the company had  in cash on hand and the mecar cash credit line had approximately  of cash availability at year end 
for the year ended december   the company used  of cash for operating activities from continuing operations 
as explained above  the company does not anticipate using cash at this level in  mainly as a result of the substantial increase in the sales backlog at mecar 
in addition to the operational improvements that are anticipated for  the cash loss in was negatively impacted by significant cash expenditures that are not recurring in nature and are not projected for these expenditures include items such as registration delay payments and interest premiums paid for failure to register the company s common stock associated with the senior convertible notes of  financing fees paid in conjunction with additional borrowings of senior convertible notes of  additional legal costs associated with bondholder issues of cash funding of subsidiaries that have been divested 
seaspace corporation sold july and titan dynamics systems  inc sold march of  restructuring consultants and advisors fees of  in general  the company believes  it will be able to successfully find a solution for mecar s credit facility and fund operations in and meet the obligations associated with the potential put on its convertible notes based on its current backlog  history of performing at a profit when backlog is substantial  the ability to raise capital and the ability to further divest of its subsidiaries 
the company s independent audit firm has issued an audit opinion that expresses doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern mainly due to losses from operations and the uncertainty of the company s ability to refinance the mecar credit facility 
the company s backlog has shown substantial improvement from the prior year  and the profitability of the contracts should permit the company to generate cash from its operations in the company continues to work on a solution for the mecar credit facility 
the major obstacle to finalizing the restructured terms with the existing bank group is the approval of additional local government support related to guarantees for the performance bonds and advance payment guarantees 
the company is requesting that the local government agency guarantee a larger portion of the performance bonds and advance payment guarantees than they currently do  thereby lowering mecar s restricted cash requirements and providing more operating cash to mecar 
this agency started providing guarantees on mecar s performance bonds and advance payment guarantees on july  as mecar initially faced its liquidity challenges associated with the receipt of its new substantial sales contract 
the local government agency is scheduled to meet in mid april to review mecar s proposal 
while the company is looking to secure long term financing for operations for the remainder of and  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful securing new mecar financing or restructuring its existing banking group at mecar 
the company will be successful in taking necessary steps to be in a position to satisfy a potential put of its senior secured convertible notes which may be made in december or january the company will be successful in its restructuring and turnaround efforts at its subsidiaries 
the company will be able to meet the financial debt covenants of its debt instruments 
the company has less than of firm commitments for capital expenditures outstanding as of december  no additional capital commitments are necessary to support the company s revenue projections 
in addition  with the assistance of its investment banker  the company continues to examine its strategic alternatives 
results of operations allied had a net loss of  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the comparable period in the results were favorably impacted by a substantial gain on the sale of subsidiaries  particularly the vsk group  of  while the results were negatively impacted by tax expense of  related to the full valuation allowance recorded against mecar s deferred tax assets 
the net loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the comparable period in the increased loss from continuing operations before income taxes in mainly resulted from the following non recurring expenses increased legal and professional fees at corporate and mecar of  mainly associated with restructuring activities  the write off of debt issue costs associated with the company s financing and refinancing of  and  an increase in the loss from the fair value adjustment of the company s convertible notes of  due primarily to the settlement provisions of the amendment agreement 
in general  after adjusting for these non recurring charges  the company continued to sustain losses at the level because of reduced revenues 
in  mecar completed a significant multi year contract with its largest customer and a replenishment contract was not received from the customer until july notwithstanding the large orders received by mecar in july through december  mecar suffered a substantial decrease in revenue in inasmuch as mecar had virtually no work in early  its revenues in were only  compared to  in mecar was able to cut its operating costs in by keeping the facility idle in the early part of prior to the receipt of significant new orders 
in the quarter ended december   as raw materials and components were received for mecar s new contracts  mecar ramped up its production and generated revenues of  and pretax income of  the company expects continued improved performance from mecar throughout in july  mecar announced that it had successfully negotiated several new orders with various clients in asia  europe  north america and other export markets  with a total expected value exceeding  over a three year period 
of the  the segment had already received firm contracts totaling more than  for delivery during and the company expects mecar to receive a second tranche of these contracts of approximately  in early to mid in addition in february  the company announced the award of an additional multi year contract at mecar for  on a consolidated basis  the company had firm committed backlog of  and additional unfunded backlog of  at december  the company expects improved performance for mecar and the other subsidiaries 
the company has engaged consultants at mecar and nsm to restructure the operations in order to decrease the break even point at each subsidiary 
the company estimates that the break even point is approximately  per year in revenue for mecar while nsm s break even point is estimated at annual revenue of approximately  at nsm  the company has also restructured the subsidiary s sales and marketing structure for improved effectiveness

the decline of the es segment margins in was a result of a relatively high level of fixed production costs at nsm with lower sales volume 
the gross margin on gms products is typically more favorable than nsm s margins as gms production is manufacturing of a niche product and less system integration manufacturing than nsm 
overall  many of the company s segments operate within a relatively fixed cost environment 
sales declines on a year to year basis  below these fixed costs levels  can have an unfavorable impact on profitability 
the company is focused on reducing these breakeven points wherever it can on both a tactical and strategic level

the company has obtained a waiver for the year ending december  and is in discussion with the lenders regarding a waiver for and a potential refinancing 
mecar s banking group has been working with the company to restructure the terms of the facility as mecar has been restructuring its business to return to profitability 
early in  the company committed to the banking group that mecar would refinance its credit facility  no later than march  in january and february of  the banking group notified mecar that it would hold mecar to its commitment to refinance the facility in early the company has reached a tentative agreement with the lenders for a short term solution as the company continues to look for alternative financing and generates cash from its backlog position 
other subsidiaries 
nsm and the mecar usa operated in from cash generated from operations and cash infusions by allied 
in  gms operated from cash generated from operations 
stock repurchases 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in and does not anticipate repurchasing any shares in future liquidity 
allied s initial focus is to secure the restructuring of the mecar bank facility 
as described above  this will likely require assistance from the belgian local government 
assuming this restructuring is completed  allied must then take the steps necessary to assure that it can meet a put option of its convertible notes at year end as noted above  allied is considering a sale of another of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash for this purpose 
allied s future liquidity will depend on its ability to generate cash in based on its significant increase in backlog 
on a longer term basis  allied s future liquidity will depend on continuing to receive orders at the rate realized in the second half of from its traditional customers and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
the company s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its continued ability to generate positive cash flow from operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar  and the company s ability to minimize its corporate overhead structure 
over the past two years  the company has spent a significant amount on audit fees associated with multi year accounting restatements  consulting and strategic advisor fees used to reduce the fixed operating structure of its subsidiaries  refinance its senior convertible notes and evaluate its strategic alternatives including the sale of its subsidiaries  and increased legal costs associated with the alleged defaults of its senior convertible notes  their subsequent refinancing and the uncertainty regarding mecar s credit facility on a long term basis 
as described in note k of the consolidated financial statements  the senior secured convertible notes have a put feature that allows the holders to put the notes back to the company on december  and january  the put feature requires the holders of the senior convertible notes to provide at least days notice of intent to enforce this feature 
the company will take necessary steps including raising additional capital or the disposition of another subsidiary to be in a position to satisfy the potential put of its senior secured convertible notes 
the company is currently evaluating strategic alternatives to ensure it has the funds available to meet this put feature 
in  the company expects to fund its domestic operations and mecar with cash available at december  and possible additional financing from mecar s bank facility 
mecar s cash flow is expected to be positive in assuming that it resolves its current financing issues which will enable mecar to perform on the backlog it has today 
in addition to normal operating costs  mecar may incur additional legal  consulting and financing costs in conjunction with resolving its short term and long term financing alternatives 
the company continues to work to reduce the fixed cost structure at mecar and may incur additional costs to achieve any permanent cost restructuring at mecar 
additional costs related to a permanent restructuring of mecar or additional legal and restructuring costs may have to come from the sale of equity by the company and or the sale of existing assets 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
mecar is required to provide performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for certain contracts  which are provided by mecar s banking group 
mecar is obligated to repay the bank group any amounts it pays as a result of any demands on the bonds or guarantees 
the company s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
allied has provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us recent accounting pronouncements 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates or judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method goodwill and intangible asset valuation inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts foreign currency translations derivative instruments valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar and nsm for substantially all of their fixed price sales contracts 
approximately and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  using the percentage of direct labor incurred to total estimated direct labor mecar or on a total cost incurred to total estimated cost basis nsm 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in the calculation of the expected margin and the percent complete 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires the total contract value  the estimated total direct labor cost to complete which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred labor costs to date on the contract and the estimated labor costs to complete the contract s scope of work  and or the actual total cost to date on the contract and the total estimated cost to complete the contracts scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances and testing requirements 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual results will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
revenue on contracts that do not qualify for the percentage of completion method is taken on a shipment basis  usually fob shipping point 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
the company adopted fasb no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company had  of goodwill recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment charge to earnings was required 
as required by sfas no 
 the company will perform a similar review each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital and a market capitalization approach 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in these business units fail to meet expectations  it could negatively impact revenue or cost  and could result in charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset 
as of december   the company had  of gross intangible assets with definitive lives  which includes developed technologies  patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
impairment could also result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable pursuant to sfas for intangible assets with indefinite lives the company performs an impairment evaluation in accordance with fas at december  the company had  of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of  as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
some of our customers share the same weapons platforms 
for these customers  mecar  at times  produces inventory in anticipation of receiving signed contracts for their manufacture 
this inventory  while designated for a particular contract  can be used to fulfill other contracts as long as the customer uses the same weapons platform 
at times the company may have inventory in excess of the amount designated in a signed contract 
the company feels that this inventory is still viable as it is able to sell it to other customers that share the same platforms 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of arc europe and subsidiaries including mecar and arc limited are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates 
the resulting translation gains and losses are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
in years with greater currency fluctuation  the impact on the apparent change for the same line item eg property  plant equipment would appear more significant than if all assets or liabilities were held in the same functional currency eg us dollars 
as of december   of all company assets are located in belgium  making the company sensitive to year to year fluctuations in currency  particularly the euro 
income and expense items are converted into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are credited or charged directly to operations 
for  revenue from belgium represented of the total revenue for the company 
the company recognizes the significance of foreign subsidiary operations on reported financial results thus making this a critical accounting policy 
derivative instruments 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company no longer utilizes derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recognized currently in net income 
the company believes that derivative accounting is critical to its estimates and financial reporting 
pursuant to sfas  hedge accounting and the subsequent restatements related to non hedge accounting have been material to the company s financial results and thereby represent a significant policy to the company 
the company believes hedge accounting provides financial results that better describe the underlying economics of the company s transactions rather than the results reported under non hedge accounting 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
currently  the company has full valuation allowances recorded for all deferred tax assets based mainly on the substantial losses incurred over the past three years 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of these valuation allowance on a quarterly basis as mecar performs on its substantial backlog 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
