critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for those customers which have a hub arrangement  we recognize revenue when our products are transferred from the hub to the customer s manufacturing facility or to its assembly subcontractor s manufacturing facility 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of revenue to all our distributors  domestic and foreign  and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our distributors provide us an inventory balance report at the end of each period  which enables us to determine products sold to their end customer 
we recognize revenue from our nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts received upon delivery of proto type  if such a delivery is an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions 
in this case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analyses of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due  to reduce our net receivable from such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example due to bankruptcy  etc in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific allowances are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
second  a minimum allowance is established for all other customer receivables as a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next twelve months  which involves a great deal of management judgment on our part 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved 
we make judgments in establishing inventory reserves and do not establish a reserve if the management believes certain excess or obsolete inventory will be sold 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also reserved 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped 
any proceeds received will favorably impact gross margins 
while we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and consider technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
our management must determine the probability that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets 
if we determine that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing income tax expense 
as of march   we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to utilize or recover our deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on april  as a change in accounting principle  and have recorded the cumulative effect of adoption of  as a decrease in the opening balance of retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal  as permitted by the transition provisions 
at the date of adoption  we had  of unrecognized tax benefits which decreased to  as of march  fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently  affect our operating results 
the reserve amount was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on the best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  ongoing tax audits  and other information 
our fiscal year federal income tax return was under irs examination as of march  we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes and interest that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of this examination 
during fiscal  in connection with the irs examination of our fiscal federal income tax return  we paid a tax liability and interest of  which had been previously accrued 
subsequent to march   we paid a tax liability and interest of  as a result of the irs examination of our federal income tax return 
this payment had been adequately accrued for as of march  see provision for incomes taxes of this section and note and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation in fiscal years through  we included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a pro forma disclosure of the impact stock options would have on net income loss using the fair value stock option expense recognition method  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
a revised standard  sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  was effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on april  the adoption of sfas r required us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
accounting for investment in auction rate securities the company s available for sale portfolio in fiscal is composed entirely of auction rate securities ars 
these securities are reported at fair value in accordance with sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on the company s investment portfolio of auction rate securities  the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the auction rate securities market 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the security 
the company reviews its securities for impairments in accordance with sfas no 
and fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to statement of income and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
in light of the current market condition for ars  the company developed different scenarios for the significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow model  including  but not limited to liquidity discount from to basis points for the current ars market  and the timing of recovery of ars market from two to four years 
the estimated fair value of the company s ars ranges from  to  we believe this estimated range of fair value of our ars is appropriate taking into consideration historical ars market data  the possibility of development of a secondary market for ars  recent market participant behaviors  and public policy implications associated with the student loan based ars market 
we have concluded that the fair value of our ars was  at march  and recorded a temporary impairment in value of  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments we operate in the highly cyclical global semiconductor market  evidenced by fluctuating demand cycles for our products 
from a net sales trough in fiscal year  demand had increased steadily in each of the succeeding three fiscal years   and in fiscal  we experienced a reduction in sales primarily due to a reduction in demand from one of our significant customers  as its products that use our el inverter products experienced significantly reduced sales 
additionally  our overall foundry sales reduced  as we have not focused on expanding this portion of our business 
on the other hand  we have seen increases in sales of several new products  such as led driver ics for lighting applications  high voltage pulsers for the medical ultrasound market  and multi segment el drivers for handsets 
quote activity and design wins have been strong in these markets 
our backlog is strong and our book to bill is greater than one 
these are encouraging indicators for sales growth into fiscal book to bill ratio is defined as sales orders received  divided by orders shipped during the fiscal quarter 
we believe that current booked orders will be shipped in fiscal however  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and the price of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer  although these cases have been rare 
for these reasons  purchase orders received are not necessarily reliable indicators of future sales 
we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication and testing facilities in the coming fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we operate in one business segment comprised of the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the medical electronics  imaging  industrial other  telecom and led lighting markets as well as year over year changes are shown below in thousands dollars in thousands fiscal years ended year over year markets march  march  change medical electronics imaging industrial other telecom led lighting net sales we have a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
net sales for the fiscal year were  a decrease compared to  for the prior fiscal year  which was primarily due to reduced demand from a major handset customer of el inverters  which are part of our imaging market 
however  sales increased in our medical electronics  telecom and led lighting markets 
our sales to the medical electronics market accounted for of total sales in fiscal and increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase is attributable to higher unit shipments of our high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and foundry medical products 
these increases were partially offset by reduced selling prices of analog switches and multiplexers  as we have experienced increased pressure to reduce prices due to increased competition 
in recent years  the ultrasound market experienced significant growth in the transportable  hand carried ultrasound units 
these high performance  portable  affordable systems are accelerating the proliferation of ultrasound imaging to medical specialties other than the traditional clinical applications 
geographically  the market is expanding as well  as china  korea and india are now designing and producing medical ultrasound machines 
we believe that sales of our high voltage analog switches and multiplexers  high voltage pulser ics  high speed mosfet drivers  and discrete high voltage fets to this market will continue to increase as the ultrasound market continues to expand globally 
we are heavily investing in product development for the ultrasound market and we expect to introduce more new integrated pulser ics as well as ultrasound receiver blocks 
custom high voltage pulsers are projected to contribute to our revenue growth in fiscal sales to the imaging market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to significantly reduced demand from a major handset customer using our el inverter products for keypad backlights in its cell phones 
during fiscal  our customer lost market share as our customer s products matured and demand for them declined 
in the last half of fiscal new handset models using our recently developed multi segment el inverter products have been designed in and are in preproduction at this major customer as well as at another large handset customer 
sales of our el driver ics for other end products also declined in fiscal  while sales of drivers for non impact inkjet printers and plotters were essentially flat in fiscal we are one of the key providers of el driver ics for cell phones  pdas  and watches and the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
we project a continuing decline in sales of single segment el inverter products during the first half of fiscal  perhaps with a modest recovery in the second half 
we believe that the multi segment el inverter products will mitigate the first half decline 
sales in the industrial other market decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due to reduced foundry sales 
sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales is primarily due to higher shipments for a military radio application and for optical mems drivers 
we anticipate modest growth in this market in fiscal sales to the led lighting market of  in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to introduction of our new line of led backlight drivers for flat screen tvs and led drivers for general lighting 
we expect increasing sales in the led general lighting market in fiscal our principal geographic markets are in china  united states  asia  and europe

china japan united states europe japan other net sales net sales to international customers in fiscal were  or of our net sales as compared to  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
the decreases in sales to china and the asian region are primarily due to the decline in shipments of our el inverters to manufacturing locations in those regions 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower overall sales  reduced average selling prices in certain medical ultrasound products  and higher inventory write downs 
the company wrote down inventory valued at   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company recorded revenue from the sale of previously written down inventory of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively

we also expense proto type wafers and mask sets related to new products as r d expenses until new products are released to production 
expenditures for r d were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase of  in r d expense for the current year is primarily due to higher depreciation of  increased usage of wafer fab services in support of development activities for advanced manufacturing processes of  higher outside services design support of  and higher payroll expense of  partially offset by reduced benefits expense of  due to lower profit sharing bonus  a reduction in fair value of the company s deferred compensation plan assets  and reduced fas r stock compensation expense 
during fiscal  benefits expense related to sfas r was  compared to  in fiscal design win activities remained strong in fiscal as we introduced thirty two new products 
r d expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to decreased net sales 
we expect to keep r d spending in fiscal year at to of net sales

also contributing to the reduced expense were lower sales commissions due to lower sales  and reduced bad debt expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately  in payroll expense as we expanded our sales force in hong kong  japan and south korea 
sg a expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars as the company expands sales and marketing presence worldwide to support the expected strong growth 
sg a expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales

other income expense  net other income expense  net was an expense of  for fiscal compared to an income of  for fiscal this difference of  is primarily due to a decline in fair value of investments held by our supplemental retirement plan of  in fiscal versus an increase in fair value of  in fiscal provision for income taxes the provision for incomes taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  at an effective tax rate of compared to  at an effective tax rate of in the lower effective tax rate in fiscal reflects higher tax benefits from tax exempt investments  domestic production activities deduction  foreign earning tax differential and r d credits 
our effective tax rate of is less than the combined federal and state tax rate due to the benefits of tax exempt investment income  domestic production activities deduction and r d credits  partially offset by the adverse impact of stock based compensation expenses

overall demand for our products in fiscal was higher compared to fiscal in all five of our major markets  which are medical electronics  imaging  industrial other  telecom and led lighting 
the increase in net sales of is primarily due to higher unit shipments in our five major markets as several of our products  launched in fiscal through  continued to ship in increasing volumes 
our sales to the medical electronics market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase is attributed to an increase in ultrasound units shipped  primarily due to an increasing ultrasound market worldwide and design wins of our analog switches and multiplexers as well as our high voltage pulser ics 
in recent years  the ultrasound market experienced significant growth in the transportable  hand carried ultrasound units

sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed an increase of over the prior year primarily due to the continued increase in unit demand for el drivers for cell phones 
we are one of the key providers of el drivers for cell phones  pdas  and watches 
sales of our drivers for other products such as non impact inkjet printers and other display products were essentially flat in fiscal we are the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
sales to the industrial other market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments of our driver for a manufacturing tester application and due to increased shipments of our foundry products 
sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was the result of increased demand for our mosfets for satellite a tv interface  dc to dc converters  line protection devices  ics for military radio frequency scramblers and high voltage amplifier arrays for the optical to optical telecom market 
sales to the led lighting market increased to  from  or 
the increase was primarily due to introduction of our new line of led and led backlight drivers for flat screen tvs and general lighting

the increase in sales to europe is primarily due to design wins in germany 
the decrease in sales to our other customers is primarily due to products reaching the end of life

gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributed to higher sales  an increase in plant capacity utilization with economy of scale  and to a lesser degree a favorable product mix  which consisted of higher sales of our newer products replacing declining sales of the lower margin legacy products

financial condition overview total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments balance as of march  was  compared with  on march   and  on april  this decrease resulted primarily from our repurchase of  shares of our stock on the open market for  offset in part by  of cash provided by operating activities 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities

for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in net income  a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to an increase in fiscal  and an increase in accounts receivable balance in fiscal compared to a decrease in accounts receivable balance in fiscal  as a higher percentage of sales in fiscal were generated at the end of the year 
also contributing to the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities were greater increases in deferred tax assets and inventories compared to fiscal inventories increased more in fiscal compared to the prior year  as sales reduced while factory activity did not reduce proportionately 
in anticipation of higher sales in fiscal we have increased inventory levels of certain new products 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal compared to a decrease in fiscal investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we sold more auction rate securities than we bought in order to fund the repurchase of  share of our stock on the open market for  our capital expenditures in fiscal were slightly higher than in fiscal our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of auction rate securities ars and money market funds 
the auction rate securities we hold have a par value of  and have contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates are reset every seven to thirty five days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
we continue to believe that the credit quality of the auction rate securities we hold is high as they are primarily backed by student loans  are insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education  and continue to be rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
in the fourth quarter of  the auction rate securities market experienced failures 
for each unsuccessful auction  the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security  generally reset periodically at a level higher than defined short term interest benchmarks 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities  or final payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from to years 
although no assurance can be given  we expect that we will receive the full principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
as of march   we had approximately  of working capital  including approximately  of cash  cash equivalents  and shot term investments  and we have generated cash from our operations for the past several years 
at march   all of our company s long term investment securities were reported at fair value 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of auction rate securities  the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the auction rate securities market 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the security 
we have recorded a  temporary impairment in value at march  this unrealized loss reflects the decline in the estimated fair value of these securities in accordance with sfas we concluded that the impairment losses  which occurred in the year ended march  were temporary due to the following the decline in market value is due to unusual general market conditions  these investments are of high credit quality of which a significant portion of the investments are insured  there have been no defaults by the issuers  their aaa or aaa credit ratings have not been reduced at march   and  the company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs since they are generally paying comparatively high tax free interest rates every six months 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities as required by sfas r  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  compared to net cash provided of  in the prior year 
during fiscal we bought  shares of our stock on the open market for  whereas during fiscal  our stock repurchases were  shares for  in addition  during fiscal  proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp were lower as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we amended the espp to decrease the discount afforded to employees from at least to  which satisfied the requirement of a non compensatory plan for sfas r purposes but which reduced the employee participation in the espp in the second half of fiscal and fiscal we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal we believe that we have substantial production capacity in place to handle any projected increase in business in fiscal most of our  of property  plant and equipment are located in the united states 
we also believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the next twelve months 
fiscal in summary  our cash flows were as follows fiscal years ended dollars in thousands march  april  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year compared to was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable balances in fiscal  as sales softened in the second half of the fiscal year  compared to a increase at the end of fiscal  and higher net income in fiscal partially offsetting these items were an increase in inventories  a decrease in tax benefit from exercise of stock options  a reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating activities into financing activities as required by sfas r  and changes in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
fiscal year included share based compensation charges of  investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities was slightly higher in fiscal year than in fiscal this was due to the timing of purchases and sales of short term investments and slightly higher capital expenditures 
we spent  expanding our wafer fab capacity by approximately during the fourth fiscal quarter of financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities as required by sfas r  and of repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal primarily due to reduced proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options under the and plans and sale of stock through the espp 
during fiscal  we amended the espp to decrease the discount afforded to employees from at least to  which satisfied the requirement of a non compensatory plan for sfas r purposes and reduced the employee participation in the espp 
in addition  stock option exercises declined during fiscal compared to fiscal most of our  of property  plant and equipment  net  is located in the united states 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements

common stock repurchases share repurchase activities for fiscal and were as follows fiscal years ended march  march  number of shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased average price per share since the inception of the repurchase program in through march   we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of  upon their repurchase  shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares 
at march    shares remained authorized for repurchases under this program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments  and our holdings are for purposes other than trading purposes 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of auction rate securities ars and money market funds 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of  in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates  as has recently occurred  would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also adversely impact the fair value of our investments 
as of march   we had no long term debt outstanding 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are also subject to secondary market risk and credit risk 
ars are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have recently encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
we have recorded a  temporary impairment in value at march  under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
the auction rate securities we hold have a total par value of  and have contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates are reset every seven to thirty five days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
as our ars are of high credit rating  we believe the credit risk is very low and they generally pay relatively high tax free interest rates 
if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect that we will receive the principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
foreign currency exchange risks we do not hedge any potential risk from any foreign currency exposure 
with our operations in hong kong  we face exposure to an adverse change in the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar 
we believe that our exposure is relatively small  thus we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate this foreign currency exposure 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as the level of activity at this operation changes over time  actual currency gains or losses could have an adverse impact to the consolidated consolidated financial statements
