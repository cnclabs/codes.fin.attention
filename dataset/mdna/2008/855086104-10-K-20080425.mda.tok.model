impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass on certain associated costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended january   included in the company s annual report filed on form k 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods 
changes in the underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
receivables receivables are stated at an amount management expects to collect and provides for an adequate reserve for probable uncollectible amounts 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on management s assessment of the current status of individual balances 
a receivable is written off when it is determined that all collection efforts have been exhausted 
the company did not have any reserves for the fiscal year ending january  and january  notes receivable notes receivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect and provides for an adequate reserve for probable uncollectible amounts 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on management s assessment of the current status of individual balances 
a note receivable is written off when it is determined that all collection efforts have been exhausted 
the company did not have any reserves for the fiscal year ending january  and january  income taxes periodically  the company records or reduces the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions  and expectations of future taxable income 
the company expects to continue to record a valuation allowance on certain future tax benefits as required under sfas the assets are evaluated each period under the requirements of sfas currently  the company does not have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since the company expects to utilize all deferred tax assets 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires the recognition  in the financial statements  of the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the company does not have any tax positions that require recognition under fin as of april  property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building and leasehold improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment building and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception 
if a previously scheduled lease option is not exercised  any remaining unamortized leasehold improvements may be required to be recognized immediately which could result in a significant charge adversely affecting the operating results of that period 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s statements of operations for the year ended january  the company recorded impairment expense of  for goodwill in fiscal year ended january  sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit that included goodwill to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the company performed the transitional impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of relevant reporting units was in excess of the fair value of those units 
this resulted in a transitional impairment loss of  which was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of a tax benefit of  in the first quarter of fiscal subsequent to the adoption of sfas  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or when a triggering event occurs that indicates a potential impairment may have occurred in accordance with sfas future impairments of goodwill  if any  will adversely affect the results of operations in the periods recognized 
impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
any impairment which would adversely affect operating results in the affected period 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted net cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected net cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge and could adversely affect operating results in any period 
insurance programs historically  the company was self insured for casualty claims  retaining commercial insurance for casualty claims in excess of million per claim and million per year as a risk reduction strategy 
effective january  the company purchased commercial insurance for casualty claims in excess of  per claim 
accruals for self insured losses include estimates based on historical information and expected future developments 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in actual liabilities that are materially different from the calculated accruals

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks relates to interest rate changes on the revolving line of credit  of which  and was outstanding as of january  and april   respectively 
the current revolving line of credit interest rate is libor plus two percent or approximately on january  a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings  the amount of which would depend on the amount outstanding on the line of credit 
all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases a number of food items and utilizes utilities  most of which are influenced by the associated commodity prices 
although many of the products and utilities purchased are subject to changes in the associated commodity prices  certain purchasing contract arrangements containing risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility in the short term are available to the company 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to minimize price volatility 
the company does not utilize financial instruments to hedge commodity price 
the company believes it will be able to address significant commodity cost increases by adjusting its menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  rapid increases in commodity prices would likely result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts  particularly in the short term
