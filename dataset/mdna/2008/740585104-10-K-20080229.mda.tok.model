under sfas no 
 the deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on temporary differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes  in addition to net operating loss carryforwards which are reasonably assured of being utilized 
these differences are primarily attributable to the recognition of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and intangible assets  allowances for doubtful accounts and certain employee benefit accruals

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosures of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return 
under fin no 
 the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more than likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin no 
provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest  penalties and disclosures 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  we recorded provisions for certain international and state income tax uncertain tax positions based on the recognition and measurement standards of fin no 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
 approximately million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings as an increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
at the adoption date of january   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
included in the balance at january  is approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized

in january  an outstanding audit with the state of new york was agreed to and payment in the amount of million including interest was made 
with the exception of this payment  we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefit to change significantly over the next twelve months 
as permitted with the adoption of fin no 
 we have changed our classification of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognize these costs in interest and penalties expense 
as of december  and january   we had accrued interest and penalties of approximately million and million  respectively  related to uncertain tax positions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these inquiries may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other changing facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize income tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we are appropriately accrued for income taxes 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust income taxes payable which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations

that is expected to be settled during the remaining amount that has been accrued in accordance with fin is not included in the contractual obligations table because we are unable to determine when  or if  payment of these amounts will be made 
state sales taxes we have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation in accordance with sfas no 
historically  we have not collected and remitted state sales tax from conferencing collaboration solutions customers 
we were audited by the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue claiming that our audio conferencing services are subject to sales tax in massachusetts 
in march  we began assessing sales tax to our customers in massachusetts as a result of this audit 
in july  we paid an initial payment of approximately million to the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue for taxable years prior to amounts associated with and early are still under review and have yet to be settled 
after we were approached by the state of illinois in march regarding the taxability of our conferencing services in the state  we began assessing sales tax to our customers in illinois in april returns were filed and approximately million was paid to the illinois department of revenue for taxable periods prior to march additional amounts may be due as these returns are audited 
more states may claim that we are subject to an assessment of sales taxes

we believe we are appropriately accrued for these contingencies 
in january  an outstanding audit with the state of new york was agreed to and payment in the amount of million was made for outstanding telecommunications excise taxes 
in the event that actual results differ from these reserves  we may need to make adjustments which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
historically  we have collected and remitted sales tax from our non conferencing collaboration solutions customers in applicable states 
however  it is possible states may disagree with our method of assessing and remitting these state sales taxes 
capital resources in december  we expanded the committed amounts of our credit facility by million from million to million  which was further expanded to million in january we paid less than million of financing costs for each expansion of our line of credit 
our credit facility also provides for an uncommitted accordian feature allowing for an additional increase up to million of the revolving credit line  subject to its terms and conditions 
our credit facility is subject to customary covenants for secured credit facilities of this nature 
certain of our material domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged as collateral all of the issued and outstanding stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of our material foreign subsidiaries 
in april  we entered into an amendment to our credit facility which inserted into the applicable margin pricing grid a new tier based on a total leverage ratio of times or greater  increased the permitted covenant level of the consolidated total leverage ratio and amended certain other provisions to allow us to purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire up to an additional million of our common stock during  of which approximately million has been used to fund our self tender offer in the second quarter of we believe that as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants under our line of credit and have obtained any required waivers or consents from lenders  as applicable 
proceeds drawn under our credit agreement may be used for refinancing of existing debt  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under the line of credit  at our option  is the base rate the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank of america prime rate or libor  plus  in each case  an applicable margin which will vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   the applicable margin with respect to base rate loans was  and the applicable margin with respect to libor loans was

as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our line of credit 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our line of credit 
in february  we entered into a three year million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of plus applicable spread  and in august  we entered into two separate three year million interest rate swaps at and respectively 
these swaps were exclusive of our applicable margin as stated in our credit facility 
we did not designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and accounted for them in accordance with sfas no 
during the second quarter of  we terminated these interest swaps and recorded a gain of approximately million in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
changes in fair value prior to the termination of these swaps were approximately million for the six months ended june   and are recognized in earnings 
in august  we entered into two million two year interest rate swaps at a fixed rate of approximately plus applicable spread 
in december  we amended the life of one of the million swaps to three years and reduced the fixed rate to approximately 
these swaps are exclusive of our applicable margin as stated in our credit facility 
we did not designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
changes in fair value  which were approximately million of income for the twelve months ended december   are recognized in earnings 
in march and september  we entered into our yen denominated line of credit for million and million  respectively  with sumitomo mitsui banking which have interest rates of and  respectively  through march in may  the million line of credit was amended to million 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 
we have entered into various capital leases for the purchase of operating equipment 
these capital leases have interest rates ranging from to and a terms ranging from months to months 
the principal balance of these leases at december  was million 
liquidity as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic business segments for the twelve months ended december  each geographic business segment had sufficient cash flows from operations to service existing debt obligations  to fund capital expenditure requirements  which have historically been to of annual consolidated net revenues  and to fund research and development costs for new services and enhancements to existing services  which have historically been approximately to of annual consolidated net revenues 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
we have historically borrowed on our line of credit in order to fund acquisitions 
at december   we had million of available credit on our existing million line of credit 
we regularly review our capital structure and evaluate potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  cash flows from our operating segments and other factors  we may engage in other capital transactions 
these capital transactions include but are not limited to debt or equity issuances or credit facilities with banking institutions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue which results from non calendar month billing cycles and the one month lag time in billing related to certain of our services 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a  b and sab should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectibility is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in  sfas no 
became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed reviews as of january   and and immediately prior to the change in our segment reporting in the fourth quarter of with no impairments identified 
other intangible assets with finite lives that do not meet the criteria of sfas no 
continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income taxes payable  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset as of december  and was million and million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded this valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also have reserves for certain asserted international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
on july   fasb issued fin no 
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosures of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return 
under fin no 
 the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more than likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin no 
provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest  penalties and disclosures 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  we recorded provisions for certain international and state income tax uncertain tax positions based on the recognition and measurement standards of fin no 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
 approximately million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings as an increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
at the adoption date of january   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at january  is approximately million  all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
this amount is classified as income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we file federal income tax returns and income tax returns in various states and international jurisdictions 
in major tax jurisdictions  tax years from remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities 
as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits  including million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would reduce our annual effective tax rate 
in january  an outstanding audit with the state of new york was agreed to and payment in the amount of million including interest was made 
with the exception of this payment  we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefit to change significantly over the next twelve months 
as permitted with the adoption of fin no 
 we have changed our classification of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognize these costs in interest and penalties expense 
as of december  and january   we had accrued interest and penalties of approximately million and million  respectively  related to uncertain tax positions 
restructuring costs restructuring reserves are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments to individuals outside of the us are less than initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with fas no 
 we accrue an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of legal claims 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our estimates are subject to change  and we adjust the financial impact in the period in which they are resolved 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
new accounting pronouncements we will be required to adopt sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  sfas no 
provides a single definition of fair value and a hierarchical framework for measuring it  as well as establishing additional disclosure requirements about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  fas no 
r which replaces statement no 
 business combination 
fas no 
r retains the underlying concepts of fas no 
in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but fas no 
r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
fas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies under sfas no 
fas no 
r amends sfas no 
such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of fas no 
r would also apply the provisions of fas no 
r 
early adoption is not allowed 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of fas no 
r  if elected  on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the intent to mitigate volatility in financial reporting that can occur when related assets and liabilities are recorded on different bases and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas no 
 if elected  on our results of operations and financial position 
subsequent events in january  we expanded the committed amounts under the accordion feature of our line of credit by million from million to million 
we paid less than million of financing costs for this expansion of our line of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and the timing of intercompany payable settlements 
in addition  in august  we entered into two million two year interest rate swaps at a fixed rate of approximately 
on december   we amended one of the million swaps to reduce the rate to a fixed rate of and extend the maturity to august  all of these swaps are exclusive of our applicable margin as stated in our credit facility 
these interest rate swaps effectively convert the interest payments of million of our libor based borrowings to a fixed rate 
changes in fair value  which were approximately million of income for the twelve months ended december   are recognized in earnings as these interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges  in accordance with fas no 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our line of credit that are subject to interest rate risk 
each basis point increase in interest rates relative to these borrowings would impact annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million based on our december  debt level 
approximately and of our consolidated net revenues and and of our operating expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in and  respectively 
additionally  we have foreign currency denominated debt as part of our line of credit 
at december  we had debt outstanding of million euro and million canadian dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales  operating income and debt 
a hypothetical positive or negative change of in foreign currency exchange rates would positively or negatively change revenues for by approximately million  operating expenses for by approximately million and outstanding debt by million 
our principal exposure has been related to local currency sales and operating costs in the euro zone  norway  canada  the united kingdom  australia and japan 
we have not used derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange risk  and no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding at december
