item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this discussion is to summarize the financial condition and results of operations of parkvale financial corporation pfc and provide other information  which is not readily apparent from the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
reference should be made to those statements  the notes thereto and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for a complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
introduction pfc is a unitary savings and loan holding company incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
its main operating subsidiary is parkvale bank the bank  which is a pennsylvania chartered permanent reserve fund stock savings bank headquartered in monroeville  pennsylvania 
pfc and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as parkvale 
parkvale is also involved in lending in the columbus  ohio area through its wholly owned subsidiary  parkvale mortgage corporation pmc 
the bank general the bank conducts business in the greater tri state area through full service offices with offices in allegheny  beaver  butler  fayette  washington and westmoreland counties of pennsylvania  two branches in west virginia and five branches in ohio 
with total assets of billion at june   parkvale was the ninth largest financial institution headquartered in the pittsburgh metropolitan area and eleventh largest financial institution with a significant presence in western pennsylvania 
the primary business of parkvale consists of attracting deposits from the general public in the communities that it serves and investing such deposits  together with other funds  in residential real estate loans  consumer loans  commercial loans  and investment securities 
parkvale focuses on providing a wide range of consumer and commercial services to individuals  partnerships and corporations in the greater pittsburgh metropolitan area  which comprises its primary market area 
in addition to the loans described above  these services include various types of deposit and checking accounts  including commercial checking accounts and automated teller machines atms as part of the star network 
parkvale derives its income primarily from interest charged on loans  interest on investments  and  to a lesser extent  service charges and fees 
parkvale s principal expenses are interest on deposits and borrowings and operating expenses 
lending activities are funded principally by deposits  loan repayments  and operating earnings 
lower housing demand in parkvale s primary lending areas  relative to its deposit growth  has spurred the bank to purchase residential mortgage loans from other financial institutions in the secondary market 
this purchase strategy also achieves geographic asset diversification 
parkvale purchases adjustable rate residential mortgage loans subject to its normal underwriting standards 
financial condition parkvale s average interest earning assets decreased million for the year ended june  over fiscal year the overall reduction in average total assets is primarily related to the repayment of higher cost debt during fiscal and in the latter part of fiscal debt repayments included trust preferred securities of million on december   million on march  and million each of fhlb advances in february and june average loan balances decreased million  while average deposit balances rose million in fiscal year asset and liability management parkvale functions as a financial intermediary  and as such  its financial condition should be examined in terms of its ability to manage interest rate risk irr and diversify credit risk 
parkvale s asset and liability management alm is driven by the ability to manage the exposure of current and future earnings and capital to fluctuating interest rates 
this exposure occurs because the present value of future cash flows  and in many cases the cash flows themselves  change when interest rates change 
one of parkvale s alm goals is to minimize this exposure 
irr is measured and analyzed using static interest rate sensitivity gap indicators  net interest income simulations and net present value sensitivity measures 
these combined methods enable parkvale s management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of potential changes in the pricing relationship between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis provides one indicator of potential interest rate risk by comparing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing at similar intervals 
total assets define the gap ratio as rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities for a given time period divided by total assets 
parkvale continually monitors gap ratios  and within the irr framework and in conjunction with net interest income simulations  implements actions to reduce exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
such actions have included maintaining high liquidity  increasing the repricing frequency of the loan portfolio  purchasing adjustable rate investment securities and lengthening the overall maturities of interest bearing liabilities 
management believes these ongoing actions minimize parkvale s vulnerability to fluctuations in interest rates 
the one year gap ratio shifted from at june  to as of june   the three year gap ratio went from at june  to at june  and the five year gap ratio was at june  versus at june  the improvement in the one year gap ratio is due to an increase in investments and arm loans scheduled to reprice or mature within one year 
gap indicators of irr are not necessarily consistent with irr simulation estimates 
parkvale utilizes net interest income simulation estimates under various assumed interest rate environments to more fully capture the details of irr 
assumptions included in the simulation process include measurement over a probable range of potential interest rate changes  prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  other imbedded options  loan and deposit volumes and rates  nonmaturity deposit assumptions and management s capital requirements 
the estimated impact on projected net interest income in fiscal assuming an immediate shift in current interest rates  would result in the following percentage changes over fiscal net interest income basis points bp   bp   bp   bp  
this compares to projected net interest income for fiscal made at june  of bp   bp   bp   bp  
the fluctuation in projected net interest income between fiscal and is reflective of wider net interest margins 
interest sensitivity analysis 
the following table reflects the maturity and repricing characteristics of parkvale s assets and liabilities at june  dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets months months years years total arm and other variable rate loans other fixed rate loans  net variable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities investments and federal funds sold equities  primarily fhlb total interest sensitive assets ratio of interest sensitive assets to total assets interest sensitive liabilities passbook deposits and club accounts checking accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances and other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities ratio of interest sensitive liabilities to total liabilities and equity ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities periodic gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets includes total repayments and prepayments at an assumed rate of per annum for fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  with the amounts for other loans based on the estimated remaining loan maturity by loan type 
based on historical data  assumes passbook deposits are rate sensitive at the rate of per annum  compared with for fiscal include investment checking accounts  which are assumed to be immediately rate sensitive  with remaining interest bearing checking accounts assumed to be rate sensitive at in the first year and per annum thereafter 
noninterest checking accounts are considered core deposits and are included in the years category 
asset management 
a primary goal of parkvale s asset management is to maintain a high level of liquid assets 
parkvale defines the following as liquid assets cash  federal funds sold  certain corporate debt maturing in less than one year  us government and agency obligations maturing in less than one year and short term bank deposits 
the average daily liquidity was for the quarter ended june  during fiscal  in addition to maintaining high liquidity  parkvale s investment strategy was to purchase investment grade securities rated bbb or higher and single family adjustable rate mortgage arm loans to enhance yields and reduce the risk associated with rate volatility 
parkvale s lending strategy has been designed to shorten the average maturity of its assets and increase the rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio 
in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of mortgage loans originated or purchased were adjustable rate loans 
parkvale has continually emphasized the origination and purchase of arm loans 
arms totaled million or of total mortgage loans at june  versus million or of total mortgage loans at june  to supplement local mortgage originations  parkvale purchased loans aggregating million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  from mortgage bankers and other financial institutions 
the loan packages purchased were predominately and residential arms 
all of the fiscal  and purchases were residential arms that were generally originated at competitive rates that may be considered teaser rates as the rates are projected to increase when the rates contractually reset in future periods 
the loans purchased from others are reviewed for underwriting standards that include appraisals  creditworthiness and acceptable ratios of loan to value and debt to income that are calculated at fully indexed rates 
the practice of purchasing loans or arm securities in the secondary market is expected to continue in fiscal when liquidity exceeds targeted levels 
at june   parkvale had commitments to originate mortgage loans totaling million and commercial loans of million 
commitments to fund construction loans in process at june  were million  which were funded from current liquidity 
parkvale continues to focus on its consumer loan portfolio through new originations 
home equity lines of credit are granted up to of collateral value at competitive rates 
in general  these loans have shorter maturities and greater interest rate sensitivity and margins than residential real estate loans 
at june  and  consumer loans were million and million which represented a increase and a decrease over the balances at june  and  respectively  with fixed rate second mortgage loans totaling million  million and million of outstanding balances at june   and  respectively 
investments in mortgage backed securities and other securities  such as us government and agency obligations and corporate debt  are purchased to enhance parkvale s overall net interest margin and to diversify asset concentration 
during fiscal  parkvale purchased an aggregate of million of investment securities classified as held to maturity  compared to million of such purchases in fiscal and million in fiscal of the amount purchased in fiscal  million had adjustable interest rates 
of the adjustable rate securities purchased  are tied to one year treasury or libor indices  are tied to six month libor  are tied to three month libor and are tied to one month libor 
these adjustable securities were purchased at an average yield of 
yields fell as the index rates decreased in the second half of the fiscal year 
at june   the combined weighted average yield on adjustable corporate securities and collateralized mortgage obligations was 
if the interest rate indices were to fall further  net interest income may decrease if the net yield  after discount amortization  on these securities  as well as other liquid assets and arm loans were to fall faster than liabilities would reprice 
substantially all debt securities are classified as held to maturity and are not available for sale or held for trading 
liability management 
deposits are priced according to management s asset liability objectives  alternate funding sources and competitive factors 
certificates of deposits maturing after one year as a percent of total deposits were at june  and at june  the reduced percentage of longer term certificates is reflective of consumer preference for shorter terms 
over the past years  parkvale has made a concentrated effort to increase low cost deposits by attracting new checking customers to our community branch offices 
during fiscal  checking accounts increased by compared to a increase during fiscal parkvale s primary sources of funds are deposits received through its branch network  and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
fhlb advances can be used on a short term basis for liquidity purposes or on a long term basis to support lending activities 
contractual obligations information concerning our future contractual obligations by payment due dates at june  is summarized as follows 
contractual obligations for deposit accounts do not include accrued interest 
payments for deposits other than time  which consist of noninterest bearing deposits and money market  now and savings accounts  are based on our historical experience  judgment and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
due one year years years years total dollars in thousands deposits other than time time deposits advances from fhlb operating leases total concentration of credit risk financial institutions  such as parkvale  generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility of loss is known as credit risk 
credit risk is increased when lending and investing activities concentrate a financial institution s earning assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of related occurrences 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include  but not be limited to  geographic concentrations  loans or investments of a single type  multiple loans to a single borrower  loans made to a single type of industry and loans of an imprudent size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
for loans purchased and originated  parkvale has taken steps to reduce exposure to credit risk by emphasizing lower risk single family mortgage loans  which comprise of the gross loan portfolio as of june  the next largest component of the loan portfolio is consumer loans at  which generally consists of lower balance second mortgages and home equity loans originated in the greater pittsburgh area and ohio valley region and an auto loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate reo consisted of the following at june dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans mortgage consumer commercial total nonaccrual loans total nonaccrual loans as a of total loans total foreclosed real estate  net total amount of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate total nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate as a percent of total assets a weakening of the national and to a lesser extent local housing sector and credit markets has contributed towards an increased level of nonaccrual delinquent days or more assets 
nonaccrual single family mortgage loans at june  consisted of owner occupied homes 
as of june   million or of the million of nonaccrual mortgage loans were purchased from others 
management believes the loans are well collateralized as single family loans are generally originated at a maximum of loan to value or the borrower is otherwise required to purchase private mortgage insurance 
commercial loans delinquent days or more of million at june  includes real estate loans of million to a residential developer that has experienced very slow sales of spec units  and these loans are in the foreclosure process that was completed on september  an extended unit absorption rate on this multi phase residential development caused the developer to have financial difficulties that prevented his ability to continue development of this plan 
a commercial real estate loan of  is considered impaired as the primary business operating from this location has closed and foreclosure is in process 
the allowance for loan losses was increased during fiscal to provide for losses on these facilities 
a multi family apartment building loan with a balance of  is more than days past due and the borrower has declared bankruptcy in response to collection efforts that may result in foreclosure  management believes this facility is well collateralized 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when  in management s judgment  the probability of collection of principal and interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a result  uncollected interest income is not included in earnings for nonaccrual loans 
the amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that has not been recognized in interest income was  for fiscal and  for fiscal parkvale provides an allowance for the loss of accrued but uncollected interest on mortgage  consumer and commercial business loans  which are days or more contractually past due 
in addition  loans totaling million were classified as special mention and  were classified as substandard for regulatory purposes at june  the special mention loans consist of million of commercial loans and million of commercial real estate loans 
these loans  while current or less than days past due  have exhibited characteristics which warrant special monitoring 
examples of these concerns include irregular payment histories  questionable collateral values  investment properties having cash flows insufficient to service debt  and other financial inadequacies of the borrower 
these loans are regularly monitored with efforts being directed towards resolving the underlying concerns while continuing with the performing status classification of such loans 
loans that are to days past due at june  aggregated million  including million of single family loans  compared to million at june  and million at june  in addition  parkvale has invested in trust preferred securities issued by other companies 
at june   trust preferred securities with an aggregate carrying value of million had deferred interest payments aggregating  for a further discussion of the trust preferred securities held by parkvale  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this document 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan loss was million at june  and million at june  or and of gross loans at june  and june   respectively 
the allowance increased during fiscal commensurate with the increase of troubled loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss is determined by management through an evaluation of individual nonperforming  delinquent and high dollar loans  economic and business trends  growth and composition of the loan portfolio and historical loss experience  as well as other relevant factors 
the loan portfolio is monitored by management on a regular basis for potential risks to detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
management then establishes reserves in the allowance for loan loss based upon evaluation of the inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan loss is adequate to absorb probable loan losses 
the following table sets forth the allowance for loan loss allocation at june dollars in thousands general allowances residential mortgages commercial multi family mortgage consumer loans commercial loans total general specific allowances residential mortgage consumer commercial total specific total allowances for loan losses the allowance on residential family loans is million or of the residential family loan portfolio at june   on commercial and multi family loans the allowance is million or of the commercial and multi family loan portfolio  on consumer loans the allowance is million or of the consumer loan portfolio and on the commercial loan portfolio the allowance is million or of the commercial loan portfolio 
results of operations parkvale financial corporation reported net income for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per diluted share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended june  the  decrease in fiscal net income reflects increases of million of net security impairment writedowns  million in the provision for loan losses and  in non interest expense  offset by a decrease of million in income tax expense and increases of million in net interest income and million in other non interest income 
interest income interest income on loans decreased by  or in fiscal average loans outstanding in fiscal were billion  representing a decrease of million or  partially due to a decreased level of loan purchases amounting to million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal single family residential loans declined by million or from june  to june   and multi family residential loans declined by million or over the same period 
the lower interest income was mitigated by an increase in the average loan yield  which was in fiscal and in fiscal interest income on loans increased by million or from fiscal to commercial real estate loans and consumer loans  which have higher yields than single family residential loans  increased in fiscal the average yield on loans increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  the trend of higher yields earned relates primarily to arm loans re pricing at higher rates based on treasury rates and libor plus contractual additions 
interest income on investments increased million or in fiscal this was the result of an increase in the average yield on investments to in fiscal from in fiscal and by an increase in the average balance of million or to million 
the higher yield in fiscal is reflective of an increase in average corporate debt securities to million and the maturity or call of lower yielding agency securities 
during fiscal  there was a shift in the investment portfolio from lower yielding us government and agency obligations to higher yielding trust preferred securities and aaa rated collateralized mortgage obligations 
of the investment securities held to maturity  million matured in fiscal  including million of us government and agency obligations with an average yield of

interest income on investments increased by  or from fiscal to this was the result of the average yield on investments increasing to in fiscal from in fiscal and offset by a million or decrease in the average balance 
interest income on federal funds sold decreased million or from fiscal to the decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in the average yield from in fiscal to in fiscal  coupled with a decrease in the average federal funds sold balance from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the average balance of federal funds sold increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal with interest income increasing million from fiscal to the average yield increased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense interest expense on deposits increased million or from fiscal to fiscal the average deposit balance increased million or in fiscal and the average cost increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the average balance of certificate accounts increased by million or from fiscal to fiscal  and the average rate on such accounts increased by five basis points in fiscal interest costs increased in fiscal as maturing time deposits repriced at higher rates due to competition offering a variety of specials to attract funds 
interest expense on deposits increased million or between fiscal and the average cost increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  and the average deposit balance increased by million or from fiscal to the average balance of certificate accounts increased by million or from fiscal to fiscal  and the average rate on certificate accounts increased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense on borrowed money decreased by  or in fiscal this was due to a decrease of million in the average balance due to the maturity of fhlb advances 
the average cost of borrowings was in fiscal and in fiscal interest expense on trust preferred securities decreased million or for fiscal the average balance decreased million or and the average cost decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the lower average balance is attributable to the early extinguishment of million of trust preferred securities in december  which resulted in a pre tax charge of   after taxes or per diluted share in the december quarter  and of million of trust preferred securities in the march quarter  which resulted in a pre tax charge of   after taxes or per diluted share 
in fiscal  interest expense on borrowed money decreased by  or  primarily due to a million or decrease in average borrowings 
the overall average cost of borrowings increased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense on trust preferred securities decreased  or for fiscal  primarily due to the early extinguishment of million of trust preferred securities in the march quarter 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments and federal funds sold and interest paid for deposits  borrowings and trust preferred securities 
a positive interest rate spread is achieved with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities  which results in increased net interest income 
net interest income increased million or from fiscal to fiscal the average interest rate spread increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  while average net interest earning assets decreased million or 
in fiscal  net interest income decreased  or 
the average interest rate spread decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  while average net interest earning assets increased million between the two years 
at june   the weighted average yield on loans  investments and federal funds sold was 
the average rate payable on liabilities was for deposits  for borrowings and for combined deposits and borrowings 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an amount added to the allowance against which loan losses are charged 
the provision for loan losses was million in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the provision increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal year aggregate allowances were of gross loans as of june  compared to at june  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover the amount of probable credit losses in the loan portfolio as of june  parkvale s nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses are discussed earlier in this section 
in addition  see critical accounting policies and judgments allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased by million or in fiscal fee income derived from deposit accounts decreased  while other fees and service charges on loan accounts increased  net gain on the sale writedown of securities decreased by million 
the fiscal net loss on the writedown of securities of million was partially offset by  of gains on miscellaneous securities 
in fiscal  the net gain on sale of securities was  service charges on deposit accounts increased by  while other service charges and fees decreased by  between fiscal and other income increased  or in fiscal  and increased  or in fiscal the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance increased by million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due primarily to a million investment made in july investment service fee income earned by parkvale financial services investment representatives increased  to million in fiscal versus  in fiscal and  in fiscal noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased  or in fiscal and by  or in fiscal over fiscal compensation and employee benefits increased million or during fiscal and  or during fiscal over the respective prior periods 
the fas r expense recognized for stock option grants was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal compensation and benefits during fiscal include normal merit pay and benefits increases along with additional staff increases of a chief lending officer  parkvale settlement services title insurance personnel and the opening of our th branch office in pleasant hills  pennsylvania in november office occupancy expense decreased  or in fiscal and decreased  or in fiscal over the respective prior periods 
the decrease is due to lower levels of depreciation  which was partly offset by the costs of opening the pleasant hills branch office in november the decrease is primarily due to the purchase of the headquarters building in january reducing overall occupancy costs and mitigated somewhat by the opening of the th branch office 
marketing expenses increased  or in fiscal and decreased  or in fiscal the fiscal increase is attributable to the opening of the pleasant hills office in november and promotions to increase the awareness of newer offices 
deposits at the bank are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic through the deposit insurance fund dif 
fdic insurance expense was   and  relating to savings deposit premiums averaging basis points during fiscal  basis points during fiscal  and basis points during fiscal  respectively 
the financing corporation fico assessment is the total expense in the last three fiscal years and the fdic has slowly decreased the rate charged on a quarterly basis 
the fdic insurance premium is expected to increase for fiscal by  due to a change in assessed premiums as of a credit permitted by the fdic is payable in cash beginning with expense recognition for the september quarter 
see regulation insurance and regulatory structure section in item of this report 
other expense increased by  or in fiscal primarily due to data processing expense related to enhancements to products and services  primarily for image processing of check deposits 
the amortization expense of core deposit intangibles was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal and  in fiscal miscellaneous expense decreased by  or in fiscal income taxes federal and state income tax expense decreased by million or in fiscal due to a decline in the effective tax rate and a decrease in pre tax income 
federal and state income tax expense increased by  or in fiscal due to a increase in pre tax income and a slight increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal in each of the last three fiscal years  the effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory rate of as a result of the benefits of certain investments made by the company and its subsidiaries 
as discussed in note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the effective tax rate for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
commitments at june   parkvale was committed under various agreements to originate fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans aggregating million and million  respectively  at rates ranging from to for fixed rate and to for adjustable rate loans  and had million of unused consumer lines of credit and million in unused commercial lines of credit 
parkvale was committed to fund commercial development loans in process of million and residential loans in process of million 
parkvale was also committed to originate commercial loans totaling million at june  outstanding letters of credit totaled million at june  liquidity and capital resources liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers  as well as the obligations to depositors and debt holders 
parkvale uses its asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to control and manage liquidity risk 
federal funds sold decreased million or from million at june  to million at june  loan balances decreased million or  investments held to maturity increased million or and cash and non interest earning balances decreased million or 
the increase in total assets was due to increased deposit balances of million or  offset by the redemption of trust preferred securities of million and by decreased advances of million or 
parkvale s fhlb advance available maximum borrowing capacity exceeds million 
if parkvale were to experience a deposit run off in excess of available cash resources and cash equivalents  available fhlb borrowing capacity could be utilized to fund a decrease in deposits 
trust preferred securities of million at were repaid on december  the early extinguishment of million of trust preferred securities resulted in a pre tax charge of   after taxes or per diluted share in the december quarter 
shareholders equity increased million or at june  compared to june  accumulated other comprehensive loss income was million at june  dividends declared in fiscal were million equal to per share  representing of net income for the fiscal year ended june  treasury stock purchased in fiscal was million  which was partially deployed for funding stock options and benefit plans totaling million 
the book value of parkvale s common stock increased to at june  from at june  due to the net increase in shareholders equity 
at june   the bank held million of preferred stock in freddie mac 
since such stock is accounted for as available for sale  unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  are reported as a net amount under accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
the federal housing finance agency recently placed freddie mac into conservatorship  with the united states treasury to purchase up to billion of senior preferred stock in freddie mac as needed for such entity to maintain a positive net worth 
the closing market value of the bank s investment in the preferred stock of freddie mac on september   the first business day following the conservatorship  was approximately  the decline in the fair value of such investment will be included in the unrealized loss reported at september  in addition  the net unrealized losses are treated as a reduction of the bank s regulatory capital 
the bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of pfc 
the bank s primary regulators are the fdic and the pennsylvania department of banking 
the office of thrift supervision retains jurisdiction over parkvale financial corporation due to its status as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the bank continues to maintain a well capitalized status  sustaining a tier capital level as of june  compared to tier capital level at june  adequate capitalization allows parkvale to continue building shareholder value through traditionally conservative operations and potentially profitable growth opportunities 
management is not aware of any trends  events  uncertainties or recommendations by any regulatory authority that will have  or that are reasonably likely to have  material adverse effects on parkvale s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
however  if additional provisions for loan losses or write downs of investment securities become material in a weak economy  our net income and capital ratios would be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and judgments parkvale s consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies 
certain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect parkvale s reported results and financial position in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on parkvale s future financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased with provisions to decrease income and decreased by net charge offs 
the bank s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  trends within parkvale s market area and other relevant factors 
the first step in determining the allowance for loan losses is recognizing a specific allowance on individual impaired loans 
nonaccrual  substandard and doubtful commercial and other real estate loans are considered for impairment 
an allowance is recognized for loan losses in the remainder of the loan portfolio based on known and inherent risk characteristics in the portfolio  past loss experience and prevailing market conditions 
because evaluating potential losses involves a high degree of management judgment  a margin is included for the imprecision inherent in making these estimates 
while management believes that the allowance is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in its existing loan portfolio  future adjustments may be necessary if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at june  includes million or of the allowance allocated to loans that are not mortgages secured by single family homes 
the ability of bank customers to repay commercial or consumer loans is dependent upon the success of their business  continuing income and general economic conditions 
historically  the risk of loss is higher on such loans than single family loans  which has incurred fewer losses as the collateral value generally exceeds the loan amounts in the event of foreclosure 
investment securities available for sale 
equity securities classified as available for sale are valued at market prices at the balance sheet date 
if certain investments are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  writedowns are recognized as losses in the statement of operations 
investment securities held to maturity 
securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at cost adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity 
declines in the fair value of individual held to maturity securities below their amortized cost that are other than temporary result in writedowns of the individual securities to their estimated fair value 
such writedowns are included in earnings as realized losses 
regular quarterly reviews of investment ratings and publicly available information are conducted by management and reviewed by the audit finance committee and or the board of directors 
a listing of securities with ratings below investment grade are monitored and evaluated for possible writedown 
there were no writedowns in fiscal  and foreclosed real estate 
real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the property less cost to sell 
after foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and a valuation allowance is established for declines in the fair value less cost to sell below the property s carrying amount 
revenues  expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in the statement of operations 
gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in earnings as realized 
foreclosed real estate at june  included  of commercial property 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
 accounting for business combinations is the standard of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  fas no 
mandated use of the purchase method and eliminated the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations 
fas no 
also provided criteria to determine whether an acquired intangible should be recognized separately from goodwill 
fas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
at june   parkvale has million of core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization and million in goodwill  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
parkvale determined the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit analyses 
goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
parkvale s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business  and the value is dependent upon parkvale s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a regional basis 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features  and the ease of use of parkvale s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue  which is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services as measured by the consumer price index 
forward looking statements the statements in this annual report that are not historical fact are forward looking statements 
forward looking information should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  economic policy or conditions  federal and state banking and tax regulations and competitive factors in the marketplace 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risks considered in the development of forward looking information and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations regarding future performance 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
yields earned and rates paid the results of operations of parkvale depend substantially on its net interest income  which is the largest component of parkvale s net income
