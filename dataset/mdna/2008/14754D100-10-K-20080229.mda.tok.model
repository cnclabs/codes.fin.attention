critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  
table of contents merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was overestimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease by million in and net income would decrease by million 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or market 
management provides an allowance for shrinkage and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance  which was million  representing of the balance of merchandise held for disposition at december  adverse changes in the disposition value of the company s merchandise may require an increase in the valuation allowance 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on company owned cash advances including fees and interest and accrues losses for third party lender owned cash advances at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance product typically serves a customer base with high risk credit performance histories 
these advances are typically single payment cash advances with a typical term of seven to days 
cash advances written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding portfolio by age  delinquency and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
the company uses current portfolio performance  as well as the performance of cash advances made during the same calendar period twelve months earlier to develop expected loss rates used in determining the allowance 
increased defaults and 
table of contents credit losses  which could occur during a national or regional economic downturn or for other reasons  could require an increase in the allowance 
since cash advances are unsecured  unlike pawn loans  the portfolio s performance depends on the company s ability to collect on defaulted loans 
the company believes it effectively manages the risks inherent in this product by utilizing a variety of underwriting criteria to evaluate prospective borrowers  maintaining a customer database to track individual borrowers performance and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
any remaining unpaid balance of a cash advance is charged off once it has been in default for days or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
at december   allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned cash advances were million  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision for the combined cash advance portfolio  which increases the allowance for loan losses  was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party lenders 
if future loss rates increased  or decreased  by from levels  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income would decrease  or increase  by million  assuming the same volume of cash advances written in valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
effective january   the company began accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
management must evaluate tax positions taken on the company s tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
management judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition under fin

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
it establishes a fair value hierarchy and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in both interim and annual periods 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in december  fasb issued proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b  which delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
the company does not expect sfas to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in february  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value the fair value option and requires an entity to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect sfas to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations revised sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase price  and  determines what information to disclose to enable users of the consolidated financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in the past  the company has completed significant acquisitions 
the application of sfas r will cause management to evaluate future transaction returns under different conditions  particularly the near term and long term economic impact of expensing transaction costs up front

table of contents overview components of consolidated net revenue 
consolidated net revenue is total revenue reduced by the cost of merchandise sold in the period 
it represents the income available to satisfy expenses and is the measure management uses to evaluate top line performance 
the components of consolidated net revenue are finance and service charges from pawn loans  profit from the disposition of merchandise  cash advance fees  and other revenue 
other revenue is comprised mostly of check cashing fees but includes royalties and small miscellaneous other revenue items 
growth in cash advance fees has increased the related contribution of the cash advance products to consolidated net revenue during each of the three years of  and net revenue related to cash advance fees eclipsed pawn related net revenue  defined as finance and service charges on pawn loans plus the profit from disposition of merchandise  to become the largest component of net revenue in the growth in cash advance fees is primarily attributable to higher average balances  the addition of new units and the addition of cash advances made over the internet beginning in mid september of net revenue from pawn lending activities contributed  and of net revenue for  and  respectively 
the following graphs show consolidated net revenue and depict the mix of the components of net revenue for the years ended december   and pie chart pie chart pie chart contribution to increase in net revenue 
the company s net revenue increased and for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
cash advance fees have contributed the majority of the increase primarily because of the additional revenue and subsequent growth in revenue that followed the september acquisition of a business offering cash advances over the internet 
in addition  higher average balances owed by customers  and the growth and development of newly opened cash advance locations contributed to the increase 
as illustrated below  these increases represented of the overall increase in net revenue from to and of the company s overall increase in net revenue from to the increase in aggregate pawn related net revenue  including both finance and service charges and profit from the disposition of merchandise  contributed of the year over year increase in net revenue for compared to of growth in while the percentage of pawn lending operations contribution to the growth in consolidated net revenue was smaller in the years ended december  and than in each of the respective prior years  net revenue from pawn lending activities increased and for the years ended december  
table of contents and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
the disproportionate growth in net revenue from cash advance activities is mostly due to the inclusion of the operations of the online distribution channel acquired in september that were not in the full comparable periods through september other revenue accounted for and of the overall increase in net revenue in and  respectively

the increase in net revenue from cash advance operations of was primarily due to the inclusion of the operating results of cashnetusa for the full year in 
table of contents finance and service charges 
finance and service charges from pawn loans increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to higher loan balances attributable to the increased amount of pawn loans written through existing and new locations added during and an increase in the average balance of pawn loans outstanding contributed million of the increase and the higher annualized yield  which is a function of the blend in permitted rates for fees and service charges on pawn loans in all operating locations of the company  contributed million of the increase 
in addition  the company s decision to reduce the maximum loan term from days to days in pawn locations in the last half of contributed to higher reported pawn loan yields as the average balance of loans outstanding declined and customer payments of finance and service charges occurred earlier than in prior periods 
the average balances of pawn loans outstanding during increased by million  or  compared to the increase was driven by a increase in the average amount per loan outstanding that was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of pawn loans outstanding during management believes that the decrease in the average number of pawn loans outstanding could be related to the fact that higher advance rates on loans secured by gold collateral  such as jewelry  can allow customers to reduce the number of loans necessary to achieve their needs 
in addition  the decrease in loan term from to days reduces the number of loans outstanding  as the number of unredeemed loans that would have remained in the day loan cycle for the complete term are eliminated earlier in the day loan cycle 
pawn loan balances at december  were million  which was higher than at december  annualized loan yield was in  compared to in same store pawn loan balances at december  increased million  or  as compared to december  profit from the disposition of merchandise

overall gross profit margin decreased slightly from in to in excluding the effect of the disposition of refined gold  the profit margin on the disposition of merchandise including jewelry sales decreased to in from in the profit margin on the disposition of refined gold increased to in from in primarily due to the higher market prices for gold  which in turn caused the hedge adjusted selling price per ounce to increase in compared to the company also experienced a increase in the volume of refined gold sold during  which is generally in line with the increase in pawn loan balances for the period  primarily due to higher pawn loans on jewelry  the liquidation of jewelry inventory and the sale of gold items purchased directly from customers 
proceeds from disposition of merchandise  excluding refined gold  increased million  or  in primarily due to to the higher levels of retail sales activity that was supported by higher levels of merchandise available for disposition entering into and the net addition of pawnshop locations 
the 
table of contents consolidated merchandise turnover rate was times in both and management expects that profit margin on the disposition of merchandise in the near term will likely remain at or slightly below current levels mainly due to higher inventory levels and an increase in the percentage mix of refined gold sales  which typically have lower gross profit margins

cash advance loss provision 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on cash advances at a level projected to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance loss provision is utilized to increase the allowance carried against the outstanding company owned cash advance portfolio as well as expected losses in the third party lender owned portfolios which are guaranteed by the company 
the allowance is based on historical trends in portfolio performance based on the status of the balance owed by the customer with the full amount of the customer s obligations being completely reserved when they become days past due 
the cash advance loss provision increased million to million in  compared to million in an increased volume of cash advances contributed million of the increase in the loss provision with the remaining increase of million attributable to higher loss rates 
total charge offs less recoveries divided by total cash advances written increased in to compared to in the loss provision expense as a percentage of cash advances written was higher in  increasing to compared to in the prior year 
the loss provision as a percentage of cash advance fees increased to in from in these increases are mostly attributable to a significant increase in cash advance receivable balances and the greater mix of cash advance balances from online customers  which historically generates a higher loss rate 
in addition  this increase in loss rates and losses as a percent of fees was weighted heavily in the first six months of due to a significant increase in new customers over that period as a result of opening new markets for the online distribution channel in late and early due to the short term nature of the cash advance product and the high velocity of loans written  seasonal trends are evidenced in quarter to quarter performance 
the table below shows the company s sequential loss experience for each of the calendar quarters under multiple metrics used by the company to evaluate performance 
management believes that the increase in loss levels experienced early in was due to a large increase in new customers during the early part of the year 
typically  the normal business cycle leads sequential losses  as measured by the current period loss provision as a percentage of combined loans written in the period  to be lowest in the first quarter and increase throughout the year  with the final two quarters experiencing the peak levels of losses 
during  the quarterly sequential performance deviated from 
table of contents this typical cycle as sequential loss rates decreased from the second to the third quarter and from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
management believes that this sequential decrease was mainly due to the increase in customers who had established borrowing histories as a percent of all customers in the later half of the year 
this change in mix was primarily in the portfolio of cash advances originated by the company s online channel 
in addition  management took steps to reduce losses in its storefront business beginning in the last half of  including additional underwriting guidelines and more emphasis on collections activities 
these changes accounted for a smaller portion of the decrease in relation to the customer composition mix

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate cap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million of the company s outstanding floating rate line of credit for a term of months at a fixed libor rate of 
this interest rate cap agreement was perfectly effective at december  the company had variable rate borrowings outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rates on million of the net variable rate borrowings at december  were capped at 
interest rates on million of the net variable rate borrowings at december  were capped at 
if prevailing interest rates were to increase basis points over the rates at december  and  respectively  and the variable rate borrowings outstanding remained constant  the company s interest expense would increase by million and  and net income after taxes would decrease by million and  in and  respectively 
gold price risk 
the company periodically uses forward sale contracts with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of refined gold produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of forfeited gold merchandise 
a significant decrease in the price of gold would result in a reduction of proceeds from the disposition of refined gold to the extent that amounts sold were in excess of the amount of contracted forward sales 
in addition  a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of some of the goods pledged as collateral by customers and identified for liquidation as refined gold 
in this instance  management believes some customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount 
however  those 
table of contents customers unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral would receive lower loan amounts  possibly resulting in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company
