item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional geographic data 
our international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in approximately thirty six currencies in fiscal years and compared to twenty eight currencies in fiscal year the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows fiscal year ended june  of reported revenues exchange rates revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar mexican peso all other currencies total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the fiscal year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates as of june for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for all other currencies 
weighting is based on the twelve month fiscal year revenue for each country or region 
a increase or decrease in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year would have affected total revenues by approximately million  or 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a weighted average change in the exchange rate during the year with all other variables being held constant 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the effect of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes  and accordingly  is not necessarily an indicator of the effect of potential exchange rate changes on our net income 
we are also subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as we have the capacity to elect to borrow in other jurisdictions with more favorable interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate the need to invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and economic  pricing  financial  and other risks described in item a  risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold six patents through our jtech subsidiary 
in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that applicable law has provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of its intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  we pursue appropriate legal action when we determine that such action is appropriate

we also own numerous other trademarks and servicemarks 
this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
fluctuations and customers our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
political uncertainty and international events that often are unpredictable  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  are expected to continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our quarterly operating results 
historically  our business has been affected by seasonal trends 
for example  the european summer holidays tend to lower our sales volume in the european countries during our first fiscal quarter  as compared to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in our second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of the calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues 
during the three fiscal years ended june   we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
our us government related revenue was approximately  and of our total consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have a backlog of approximately two months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment of hardware and software or rendering of services 
as of june   and  the backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year is not recognized in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a number of risks to which we are subject 
these risks include the following environmental and geopolitical risks 
while we do not sell our products and services directly to consumers  changes in consumer habits in response to environmental or geopolitical risks affect demand for our products and services by the hospitality and tourism industries 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to downturns in customer buying habits associated with the threat of terrorist attacks and the uncertain political climates  such as those existing in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental and health disasters 
actual or anticipated environmental disasters and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  and disease  will deter and delay purchases of our products by customers  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters can also adversely affect our operations in the affected areas 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries 
reduction of discretionary spending by consumers  such as on travel and dining  as well as on retail spending generally  when there is a material increase in non discretionary expenses caused by a rise in oil and gas prices 
moreover  the increase in oil and gas prices also directly adversely affects our customer base as a direct result of higher ingredient and food costs for our restaurant customers 
while in fiscal year we did not see any material impact in connection with spikes in oil and gas prices  these developments may adversely affect our business in the future 
we maintain offices in certain parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest  and terrorism  such as argentina  brazil and israel 
the performance of our offices in these areas will be adversely impacted if these regions become subject to economic declines  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
increasing tensions between russia and the united states could adversely affect our business in eastern europe and central asia 
recent events in georgia could signal increased difficulties in the us russia relationship  which could adversely affect our customers and our business operations in the area  particularly in those countries that were formerly part of the soviet union 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
we are subject to the variability of world economies 
since a substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries  a downturn in the economies of foreign countries could adversely affect our financial results 
while  under certain circumstances  reliance on foreign operations can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions can offset another region s declining conditions  our foreign businesses nonetheless add a degree of uncertainty to our planning and forecasting process 
our quarterly financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for more than an insignificant portion of earnings in any quarter 
we expect the customers with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each customer s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  revenues that we may have expected in a given quarter could be deferred or accelerated into subsequent or earlier quarters  respectively 
these events could have a meaningful effect on our quarterly results 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our pricing to obtain business 
market forces have and will continue to place pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
product mix can affect our operating results 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our overall gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software licensed and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
because actual product mix is difficult to predict on a quarter to quarter basis  there is uncertainty and variability as to the projected gross margin on a quarter to quarter basis 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account customers generally those customers who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business involves non major accounts  there is inherent difficulty in predicting buying patterns and  accordingly  it is much harder to appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand 
this can result in inefficiencies that adversely affect our operating results 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication  which may result in increased costs that adversely affect our operating results 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of addressing increasingly complex software systems in more remote locations is high and may require us to engage contractors  who generally have a higher cost structure than that of our own employees 
the additional costs are also driven by the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products the support and service of which may be more difficult and costly  and difficulty in implementing  operating  maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases that may be out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we have little or no control over certain material expenses  such as health care costs which are generally experience based  compliance with new legislation  and rising oil and gas prices 
significant increases in any of these expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
as we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience exchange rate fluctuations that can have a significant impact on our reported results 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market trends that are out of our control and that may not reflect our actual operating performance 
we can experience short term increases and declines in our stock price due to factors other than those specific to our business  such as economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets 
we have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances 
while we have attempted to invest our cash balances in conservative investments  we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks 
for example  the company has invested some of its cash in auction rate securities  which proved to be illiquid when the financial resale markets contracted in february additionally  bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts 
technology risks 
our customers requirements are increasingly sophisticated 
to be able to continue to offer competitive products and to meet our customers requirements  we must continually develop and update our products 
unexpected costs and delays in development and implementation  and addressing our commitments to various customers  could adversely affect our financial results 
the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a customer s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement before the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
our business could be adversely affected if these problems are significant 
the manufacturing of our hardware platform is performed primarily by ges  a company in singapore 
while we believe we have a very good relationship with ges  and while we have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with ges  we cannot assure that ges will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future 
additionally  ges procures many of its components from other third parties who could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
such difficulties could interrupt ges s supply of products to us  which would adversely affect our business 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
we have certain contracts under which we are required to provide systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb costs that may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this risk can be pronounced given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the ever increasing size and scope of some of the deployments 
unanticipated costs that are not recoverable could adversely affect our operations 
our investment in certain technologies may prove to be unsuccessful and may delay our focus on more promising technologies 
as we invest significantly in research and development  there is an ever present risk that we will pursue technology that we ultimately determine is not marketable or does not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment which could have an adverse impact on our operating income 
moreover  if we are delayed in deploying better technologies  our business also could be adversely affected 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data eg  credit card numbers  and is sometimes used to store such data 
it may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in those instances  the customer may attempt to seek damages from us 
while we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems  we cannot assure that our customers systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a customer  or other person  seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach  our business could be adversely affected 
resource and personnel risks 
we could be adversely affected by vendor labor difficulties 
some of our vendors have employees who are protected by certain labor laws or who may be members of unions 
we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are subject to labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire qualified personnel  including particularly research development personnel  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer requirements on an efficient basis 
finding qualified technical personnel in all the localities where our research and development facilities are situated is an ongoing challenge 
if we cannot find appropriate personnel  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant because we do not have available personnel  development costs would increase 
in general  our inability to recruit and retain appropriate personnel would adversely affect our business 
legal and accounting risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology  these protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
we cannot guarantee that we can effectively preserve the proprietary nature and competitive advantages of our products  despite our efforts to do so through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures 
others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
moreover  others have been able to develop competitive products and services that do not violate our proprietary rights 
we are subject to litigation  which may be costly 
as a company that does business with many customers  employees and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to litigation  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
for example  we recently were subject to an adverse jury determination that we were liable for million in damages in connection with the termination of dealer relationships in while we will pursue an appeal in this matter  and while we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation and damages  litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to claims by others that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive letters from entities that assert that we are infringing a patent 
in those instances  we assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued  we also face indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
there is at least one action pending in which some of our customers have been sued on such a claim and some of our customers are seeking indemnification from us 
while we do not believe that any of our products and services infringe any patents  we may become involved in patent infringement litigation 
we may incur significant legal expenses and  if we are found liable  significant damages in connection with patent infringement litigation 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud  which may substantially increase our expenses  breaches of our customers credit card security may adversely affect us 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with the credit card associations security regulations and best practices applicable to our products and services 
we cannot assure  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  we cannot assure that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers 
our customers may not establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
if there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is a potential that parties could seek damages from us 
additionally  changes in the security guidelines could require significant and unanticipated development efforts

in general  we believe that additional space will be available as needed 
item legal proceedings we are and have been involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
there is a case pending in the us district court for the northern district of georgia  styled ware v 
abercrombie fitch stores  inc et al  although we are not a party to that case  we may have some obligation to indemnify certain of the defendants who are our customers  based on the terms of our contracts with those customers 
the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants are infringing a patent relating to the processing of credit card transactions 
the defendants include approximately individual retailers  of whom are our customers for retail point of sale software 
we are currently providing indemnity coverage to five of the defendants who are our customers in accordance with applicable provisions of the contracts between us and those customers 
the indemnity coverage estimated as of june  is immaterial 
through june   our legal fees with respect to indemnity coverage for this matter have not been material 
currently  the case is subject to a court ordered stay pending the completion of the united states patent and trademark office s reexamination of the patent that is the subject of the lawsuit 
should the case proceed  we will vigorously defend the action and assert all available defenses and arguments 
in any event  based on currently available information  we do not believe that our products infringe the patent 
heartland payment systems  inc  has filed an action in the us district court for the district of new jersey naming as defendants micros systems  inc  merchant link llc  and chase paymentech solutions  llc 
in its complaint  heartland claims that micros  merchant link  and paymentech have engaged in an anti competitive arrangement relating to credit and debit card payment processing for restaurant point of sale systems  and further claims that this arrangement violates federal antitrust law and applicable new jersey state laws 
heartland claims it has been damaged by virtue of being required to deal with merchant link if it wishes to provide services to users of micros pos software  by being required to pay fees to merchant link that it claims are inappropriate or excessive  and by being competitively disadvantaged relative to chase paymentech s services 
heartland seeks monetary damages in excess of million  and also injunctive and other equitable relief 
in february  we moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds  but the court has not yet ruled on the motion 
because the motion is still pending  our answer to the complaint is not yet due  however  we dispute the substantive allegations in the complaint 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that our relationships and agreements with merchant link and paymentech are anti competitive or otherwise violate either federal antitrust law or applicable new jersey law 
if the court does not grant micros s motion to dismiss the complaint  micros will vigorously contest the action 
on may   a jury returned a verdict of million against us in the consolidated actions of roth cash register v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
and shenango systems solutions v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
the cases initially were filed in in the court of common pleas of allegheny county  pennsylvania 
the complaints both related to the non renewal of dealership agreements in the year between us and the respective plaintiffs 
the agreements were non renewed as part of a restructuring of the dealer channel 
the plaintiffs alleged that we and certain of our subsidiaries and employees entered into a plan to eliminate the plaintiffs as authorized dealers and improperly interfere with the plaintiffs relationships with their respective existing and potential future clients and customers without compensation to the plaintiffs 
as a result  the plaintiffs claimed that we were liable for  among other things  breach of contract and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relationships 
we have moved for reconsideration of the verdict by the trial court  and  if unsuccessful in that regard  we intend to pursue a appeal  as we believe the instructions to the jury  certain rulings made by the trial court  and the jury verdict were erroneous on multiple legal grounds 
there are no other litigation matters relating to the restructuring of the dealer channel in the year subject to the foregoing  we are of the opinion  based upon presently available information and the advice of counsel concerning pertinent legal matters  that any resulting liability should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer  marketer  and servicer of enterprise information solutions for the global hospitality and specialty retail industries 
as detailed elsewhere in this report on form k  our enterprise solutions comprise three major areas hotel information systems  restaurant information systems  and specialty retail information systems 
we also offer a wide range of related services 
we distribute our products and services directly and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete on various bases  including product functionality  service capabilities  price  and geography 
we believe that our competitive strengths include our established global distribution and service network  our ability to offer a broad array of hardware  software and service products to the hospitality and retail industry and our corporate focus on providing specialized information systems solutions 
we are organized and operate in four operating segments us  europe  the pacific rim  and latin america regions 
as the products and services for all acquired entities are all similar to those of ours  the acquired entities have been incorporated into the existing four operating segments based on their respective geographic locations  and operated and managed as a part of that operating segment 
for the purposes of applying statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we have identified us as a separate reportable segment and have aggregated our three international operating segments into one reportable segment  international  as the three international operating segments share many similar economic characteristics 
our management views the us and international segments separately in operating its business  although the products and services are similar for each segment 
we continue to see overall growth in the hospitality and retail industries  slower growth in some sectors has historically tended to be offset by faster growth in other areas 
we have seen particular growth in our quick service restaurant business  including that generated by sales to various quick service restaurant chains with which we have announced buying agreements 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition  share based compensation  capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  investments in auction rate securities  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following comprise the critical accounting estimates that we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generated from software licenses  hardware and service and support 
revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which typically include hardware  software licenses and maintenance agreements sold together  are allocated to each element in the arrangement using the residual method prescribed by sop  based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement  ie  recognition of an allocated portion of revenue equivalent to the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred 
revenue from software license  hardware and service and support are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require a contract signed by both parties to the agreement or a purchase order received from the customer as persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs at fob shipping point when provided to a common carrier  if the risk of ownership has passed to the buyer or in the case of electronic delivery  delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
if the risk of ownership has not passed to the buyer when provided to the common carrier  delivery occurs when the risk has passed to the buyer 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within twelve months of delivery with generally no more than of the contract price due at the end of the payment term 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
we consider service fees to be fixed or determinable if the service fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  revenue is recognized as collection occurs 
costs related to shipping and handling and billable travel expenses are included in cost of sales 
the revenue is reduced to reflect estimated customer returns and allowances 
since our revenue deferral for undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement  our financial results for current fiscal year and future periods could be significantly different if our estimates of the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of undelivered elements change 
additionally  significant differences in the actual customer returns and allowances from our estimates could also significantly affect our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due to us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires estimates and is based on the age of the receivable  customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods 
as of june  and  accounts receivable totaled approximately million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  bad debt expenses for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or market 
standard cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we maintain a reserve for obsolescence for inventory in the amount of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
investments  non current and short term our investments in auction rate securities  which are debt instruments with long term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates  are classified as available for sale 
we carry these securities at estimated fair value with any related impairment being classified as either temporary and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity or as other than temporary and recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   we held approximately million in auction rate securities  classified as investments  non current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets compared to approximately million classified as short term investments as of june  as of june   there were temporary unrealized losses of approximately million approximately million  net of tax on these investments 
as of june   there were no unrealized gains or losses on these investments 
we recognized no gains or losses related to the sale of our investments in auction rate securities during the three fiscal years ended june  see note  investments  non current and short term in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be licensed to others  primarily consisting of salaries  employee benefits and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses until technological feasibility is established 
the capitalization of software development costs on a product by product basis starts when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization begins 
technological feasibility is established when the product reaches the working model stage 
the cost of purchased software is also capitalized 
annual amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to software cost of sales  and for each capitalized software product is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that of the software product s current fiscal year gross revenue to the total of current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the amount computed based on straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if we incorrectly estimate the remaining economic life of a product or the anticipated future gross revenues of a product  our future financial results could be materially affected as a result of the write off of amortized costs or acceleration of amortization 
amortization expense for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  during the fiscal years and  we wrote off approximately million and million in capitalized software costs related to products for which no future revenue was projected 
no capitalized software was written off in fiscal year long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the assets  based on the undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate or market value  if available  to the book value of the assets 
if the fair value is less than book value  the asset is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of book value over fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the assets for the purposes of our analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these assets 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the company 
a change in assumptions and estimates in future periods could cause us to determine that assets are impaired  resulting in a significant charge in future periods 
goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
we assess whether goodwill and our only indefinite lived purchased intangible assets  trademarks  are impaired in accordance with sfas on an annual basis  during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units our four operating segments consisting of us  europe  the pacific rim and latin america to its book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of the income approach ie  discounted future income and market approach ie  comparison to the purchase and sale of similar assets in the relevant industry to value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing their fair value to book value 
we estimate the fair value of trademarks using an income approach to value  and recognize an impairment loss if the estimated fair value of a trademark is less than its book value 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances indicating that it is more likely than not that the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademarks is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired which could result from a change in our assumptions or a decline in our market capitalization could result in a significant charge in future periods 
share based compensation we account for our option awards granted under our stock option program in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the estimated fair value of option awards is measured as of the date of grant  and non cash share based compensation expense adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures are recognized ratably over the requisite service ie vesting period of options in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  non cash share based compensation expense adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures is recognized for the non vested portion of awards that were granted before the effective date of sfas no 
r as those options become incrementally vested 
as we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions  we are required to input highly subjective assumptions about volatility rates  expected term of options  dividend yields and applicable interest rates in the option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical stock prices 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical option activities  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
for this purpose  we separate groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
total expense recorded from period to period can be significantly different depending on several variables  including any changes to these assumptions such as pre vesting cancellations and the estimated fair value of those vested awards 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no

fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin of approximately million  including interest and penalties of million  was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase in net income taxes payable 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded net unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million and million  including interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and july   respectively 
we have recognized approximately million of interest expense for the fiscal year the non current portion of the net unrecognized income tax benefits represents benefits with respect to which we do not anticipate making a payment within months of the balance sheet date 
if recognized  all of the net unrecognized income tax benefit would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense  impacting the effective income tax rate 
we have reviewed our uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fin  and currently are not able to reasonably estimate material changes in the unrecognized income tax benefits and the impact it would have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the next twelve months 
we historically classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we are maintaining this practice following our adoption of fin in the ordinary course of our business  transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain 
in addition  tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include examination of our significant tax filing positions  including the timing and amounts of deductions and the allocation of income and expenses among tax jurisdictions

software cost of sales as a percent of related revenue increased primarily due to a decrease in the third party software margin percentage compared to fiscal year additionally  the revenue from the opera suite of products was comparable to fiscal year revenue  but represented a lower percentage of total software revenue 
because the opera suite of products generates much higher margins than our third party software  this product mix change had the impact of increasing the overall software cost of sales as a percent of related revenue 
service cost of sales as a percent of related revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in travel expenses and maintenance service part costs 
the decreases in travel expenses and parts costs were partially offset by an increase in overall service labor costs mainly associated with some of our newly acquired subsidiaries

the decrease in total capitalized software development costs is primarily due to the release of our capitalized retail software product in december of for fiscal year  non cash share based compensation expenses allocated to r d were not capitalized because stock options were not granted to employees whose labor costs were capitalized as software development costs 
for fiscal year  less than million in non cash share based compensation expenses allocated to r d had been capitalized because stock options were granted to employees whose labor is capitalized

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the company s consolidated statement of cash flows summary for fiscal years is as follows fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year increased approximately million compared to fiscal year primarily due to increases in cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million and increases net income of approximately million  deferred revenue of approximately million and income taxes payable of approximately million 
one source of deferred revenue is prepaid maintenance and support fees  many of our customers are invoiced annually in advance for maintenance and support 
these increases were partially reduced by a decrease of approximately million in accrued expenses and other liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk and to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see part i  item i  foreign sales and foreign market risks  and part ii  item for information regarding foreign currency exchange risks 
the company s committed lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate  which exposes the company to interest rate risks 
the company manages its exposure to this risk by minimizing  to the extent feasible  overall borrowing and monitoring available financing alternatives 
at june   the company had total borrowings of approximately million  and had not entered into any instruments to hedge the resulting exposure to interest rate risk 
management believes that the fair value of the debt equals its carrying value at june  and june  the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under the line of credit 
as the company s total borrowing as of june  was approximately million  a change in interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to minimize the company s exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments  the company places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  generally with bond rating of a and above
