the revolving credit facility provides the company with seasonal working capital  letters of credit and funds for appropriate acquisitions of businesses similar in nature to the company s current business segments 
this debt carries a variable rate of interest that is based on prime or libor rates plus applicable margins 
at december   the revolving credit facility has a committed weighted average rate of interest including applicable margins of approximately 
such rate commitment expires in january at march   the interest rate on then current outstanding balances was set at for a period of ninety days 
the company s revolving credit facility is collateralized by certain accounts receivable  inventories and property  plant and equipment  and shares of a certain subsidiary s outstanding capital stock and ownership interests of certain of the company s limited liability subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and restrictions on additional indebtedness  common stock dividend payments  capital disposals and intercompany management fees 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  subsequent to december   the company and its primary lenders executed an amendment to the revolving credit facility 
the primary provisions of the amendment i extend the term of the revolving credit facility from october  to january   ii provide the company the option to expand the capacity of the facility from million to million during the term of the agreement  iii relieve the company of certain monthly reporting obligations  iv modify the pricing structure to provide interest rates more favorable to the company  and v update certain financial covenants to standards relevant to the company s current financial condition

management of the company believes it has sufficient capacity to maintain current operations and support a sustained level of future growth 
inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity 
inflation  including as it related to the increased cost of fuel and plastic materials  did not significantly impact the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity in  and significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements prepaid catalog costs and amortization the company accumulates all direct costs  less applicable vendor rebates  incurred in the development  production and circulation of catalogs on the consolidated balance sheets until the related catalog is mailed  at which time such catalog costs are amortized into selling and administrative expense over the estimated sales realization cycle of one year  using the straight line method 
deferred income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  wherein deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the estimated discounted cash flows or earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company evaluated its goodwill at december  and  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
defined benefit plans the company accounts for the benefits under its defined benefit pension plan using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 

these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plan 
examples of events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and  therefore  the statement of earnings effects of pension benefits are earned  and should be expensed in the same pattern 
in calculating the net periodic benefit cost and the related benefit obligation  the company is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate assumptions reflect the prevailing market rates for long term  high quality  fixed income debt instruments that  if the obligation was settled at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due 
the company uses long term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  as well as future estimates of long term investment returns  to develop its assumptions of the expected return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is based on historical experience and the company s long term plans for such increases 
in  the company increased its pension liability by million relating to the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan as required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 

in  a basis point decline in the discount rate assumptions caused a decrease in the funded status of the company s pension plan 
no change in the discount rate assumption was made in in  a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption caused an increase in the funded status of the company s pension plan 
the accumulated benefit obligation of the company s pension plan exceeded the fair market value of the plan assets at december  and as required by sfas no 
 the company recorded a minimum pension liability and recognized related non cash  after tax  net charges of 
million and 
million to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive earnings in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
these charges did not impact the company s pension expense  earnings or cash contribution requirements in or on december   the company froze the plan benefits for all hourly employees and certain salaried employees 
see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
revenues customarily applying fob shipping point terms  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers 
the point of shipment is typically from one of the company s distribution centers or  on occasion  a vendor s location as a drop shipment 
all drop shipment sales are recorded at gross selling price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
as described below  credit risk  market risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of risk in the company s accounts receivable  investments and debt 
qualitative credit risk the company provides credit in the normal course of business to its customers  which are primarily educational institutions or distributors 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  maintains allowances for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral to support its accounts receivable balances 
market risk the company s exposure to market risk relates to the quality of holdings of its limited partnership investments 
the fair market value of the limited partnerships investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuers  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuers and from changes in general market conditions 
the company seeks to manage its exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with standards established by the investment committee of the board of directors 
the standards of the investment committee are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market condit ions and tax considerations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability and its ability to realize assets and satisfy liabilities 
interest rate risk is resident primarily in debt  which typically has variable interest rates based on prime or libor rates 
assuming no other change in financial structure  an increase of in the company s variable interest rate for debt would decrease pre tax earnings for by approximately 
million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of a increase in interest rates on the average debt estimated to be outstanding on the company s primary credit facility in quantitative the company s debt as of december  is as follows in millions  except percentage data maturity less than one year maturity greater than one year amount weighted average interest rate fair market value the fair market value of debt equals the face amount of debt outstanding because the underlying rate of interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable based upon prime or libor rates 
the carrying value of the company s other long term accruals approximates fair value because the company has no reason to believe that the value of the related long term assets will increase or decrease from the sales prices thereof at their respective transaction dates
