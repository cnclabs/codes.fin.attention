many power supply manufacturers target markets similar to those of the company 
representative examples of these manufacturers are lambda electronics  a subsidiary of tdk corporation  lineage power formerly tyco electronics power systems  now owned by the gores group  artesyn technologies and astec power  subsidiaries of emerson electric co  power one  inc  and murata power solutions  a subsidiary of murata manufacturing co 
although certain of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and longer operating histories than the company  the company believes that it has a strong competitive position  particularly with customers who need small  high density power system solutions requiring a variety of input output configurations 
the company bases its competitive strategy on technical innovation  product performance  service and technical support  and in offering a broad product line 
the principal methods of competition in the markets in which the company s products compete are price  performance and the level of service and technical support offered 
patents the company believes that its patents afford advantages by building fundamental and multilayered barriers to competitive encroachment upon key features and performance benefits of its principal product families 
the company s patents cover the fundamental conversion topologies used to achieve the performance attributes of its converter product lines  converter array architectures which are the basis of the products parallelability  product packaging design  product construction  high frequency magnetic structures  and automated equipment and methods for circuit and product assembly 
the company has been issued patents in the united states which expire between and  and in far east which expire in 
the company also has a number of patent applications pending in the united states  europe and the far east 
the company intends to vigorously protect its rights under its patents 
although the company believes that patents are an effective way of protecting its technology  there can be no assurances that the company s patents will prove to be enforceable see  eg  part i  item legal proceedings 
while some of the company s patents are deemed materially important to the company s operations  the company believes that no one patent is essential to the success of the company 
licensing in addition to generating revenue from product sales  licensing is an element of the company s strategy for building worldwide product and technology acceptance and market share 
in granting licenses  the 
table of contents company generally retains the right to use its patented technologies  and manufacture and sell its products  in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use 
licenses are granted and administered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  vlt  inc  which owns the company s patents 
revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded of the company s consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately  full time and part time people 
the company believes that its continued success depends  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
although there is strong demand for qualified technical personnel  the company has not to date experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet its needs see part i  item ia risk factors 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
item a risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the risk factors set forth below 
our future operating results are subject to fluctuations 
our future operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the level of orders and demand from customers  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  the ability to achieve and or maintain yield improvements and cost reductions particularly with maxi  mini  micro and fpa products  achieving increased sales of fpa products  changes in the product mix  and changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market leading edge  cost effective products 
the power supply industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion for mature products  each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality  our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
specifically  we may not be successful in leveraging the v i chips in standard products to promote market acceptance of factorized power 
our future operating results are dependent on the growth in our customers businesses 
we manufacture modular power components and power systems that are incorporated into our customers electronic products 
our growth is therefore dependent on the growth in the sales of our customers products as well as the development by our customers of new products 
if we fail to anticipate changes in our customers businesses and their changing product needs  our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted 
if we were unable to use our manufacturing facility in andover  massachusetts  we would not be able to manufacture for an extended period of time 
all modular power components  whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products  are manufactured at our andover  massachusetts production facility 
damage to this facility due to fire  natural disaster  power loss or other events could cause us to cease 
table of contents manufacturing 
any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of this facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products  or we may purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory 
the power supply industry  and the electronics industry as a whole  can be subject to business cycles 
during periods of growth  key components required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers demands 
our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results 
we may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components 
increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers end markets 
if we purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory  we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write off the inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations 
our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we have made significant additions to our manufacturing equipment and capacity over the past several years  including equipment for fpa products and the fastrak platform 
if overall revenue levels do not increase enough to offset the increased fixed costs  or significant revenues do not materialize for the fpa products or if there is deterioration in our business  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assemblies and  therefore  cannot control their availability or quality 
we depend on third party suppliers and subcontractors to provide components and assemblies used in our products  some of which are sole sourced 
if suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications  we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected 
in addition  we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties 
in order to grow  we may need to find new or change existing suppliers and subcontractors 
this could cause disruptions in production  delays in the shipping of product or increases in prices paid to third parties 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our foreign sales and distributors 
international sales have been and are expected to be a significant component of total sales 
dependence on foreign third parties for sales and distribution is subject to special risks  such as foreign economic and political instability  foreign currency controls and market fluctuations  trade barriers and tariffs  foreign regulations and exchange rates 
sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers 
the loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
in particular  we are dependent on the services of dr 
patrizio vinciarelli  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of dr 
vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations 
in addition  we depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace 
our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
table of contents in a very competitive employment market 
if we are unable to attract and retain these employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies which must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies 
we devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights  and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights 
this protection  however  may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products 
we may be unable to protect or enforce current patents  may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict  or may be unable to acquire patents in the future  and this may have a material adverse affect on our competitive position 
in addition  the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the united states 
we have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in and devote significant resources to these efforts which  if unsuccessful  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
we may face legal claims and litigation that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future encounter legal action from customers  vendors or others concerning product warranty or other claims 
we have ongoing litigation with several customers and vendors over product warranty matters  which are fully described in part i  item legal proceedings 
such litigation is costly and diverts the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these current or future matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
if we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud or to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified 
our management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  and because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
specifically  we determined that our accounting department did not have sufficient experienced personnel and resources with the requisite technical skills to address complex and judgmental accounting  tax and financial reporting matters within the financial statement close process  including accounting for the company s related party investment in great wall semiconductor corporation  accounting for income taxes  accounting for complex revenue transactions  and accounting for judgmental accrued liabilities 
our plans to improve the effectiveness of our internal controls and processes are in process 
we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures will remediate the material 
table of contents weaknesses reported by our management 
further  additional deficiencies in our internal controls may be discovered in the future 
if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting  we may be unable to accurately report our financial results  prevent or detect fraud  or provide timely and reliable financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in fact  the company did not file its june  and september  quarterly reports on form q within the time period specified under the exchange act 
in addition  in december  the company s former chief financial officer transitioned to the position of vice president of treasury services 
the company s vice president  chief accounting officer has assumed the role of interim chief financial officer 
the company is in the process of a search for a new chief financial officer 
however  we cannot assure you if or when a new chief financial officer will be hired 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain required financial information for certain investments on a timely basis  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act  within the time periods specified 
the company is required to account for an investment under the equity method of accounting 
the company has developed processes and controls to ensure proper accounting and reporting for the investment 
we cannot assure you that those procedures  processes and controls will be adequate to ensure that we obtain the required information in order to properly account for this investment under the equity method of accounting and allow us to file our reports under the exchange act on a timely basis 
the lack of timely filing could prevent continued listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq global select market and could have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock 
the failure of auction rate securities to sell at their reset dates could impact the liquidity of the investment and could negatively impact the carrying value of the investment 
the company s short term investments consist mainly of municipal and corporate debt securities in which a significant portion are invested in auction rate securities  the significant majority of which are student loan backed securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with longer contractual maturities that range  for our holdings  from to years 
at the end of each reset period  investors can typically sell at auction or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
through march   auctions held for the company s auction rate securities with a total aggregate value of approximately million failed 
as of march   the company was holding a total of approximately million in auction rate securities 
while these debt securities are all highly rated investments  generally with aaa aaa ratings  continued failure to sell at their reset dates could impact the liquidity of the investment which in turn could negatively impact the liquidity requirements of the company 
in addition  continued failure to sell at their reset dates could also negatively impact the carrying value of the investment which could lead to impairment charges in future periods should a decline in the value of those securities be other than temporary  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item b unresolved staff comments the company has not received written comments from the securities and exchange commission regarding its periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  that were received days or more before december  and remain unresolved

table of contents the following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes of the company contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes as restated critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company employs a variety of methodologies to estimate allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
for the company s brick products produced at the andover location  its principal manufacturing location  the model used is based upon a comparison of on hand quantities to projected demand  such that amounts on hand in excess of three year projected usage are fully reserved for inventories of those products 
since v i chip products are at a relatively early stage  a one year projected usage assumption is used 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
short term and long term investments the company s short term and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and 
table of contents accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization  along with interest and realized gains and losses  are included in other income expense  net 
the company has no trading securities or held to maturity securities 
through march   auctions held for the company s auction rate securities with a total aggregate value of approximately million failed 
as of march   the company was holding a total of approximately million in auction rate securities  the significant majority of which are student loan backed securities 
these municipal and corporate debt securities have their interest rates reset at auction at regular intervals ranging from seven to ninety days 
because of these short term intervals between interest reset dates  the company monitors the auctions to ensure they are successful  which provides evidence that the recorded values of these investments approximate their fair values 
as discussed above  auctions related to substantially all our auction rate securities have failed and if auctions continue to fail such that the securities were deemed to be not liquid  the company would need to seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities  which may not be based on the quoted market transaction 
in addition  due to the company s inability to quickly liquidate these investments  the company may reclassify those investments with failed auctions as long term assets in its consolidated balance sheet 
other investments the accounting for investment transactions is reviewed for compliance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method for accounting for investments in common stock apb and or fasb interpretation no 
revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company previously accounted for the investment in great wall semiconductor corporation gws under apb as a cost method investment as management believed it did not have significant influence over gws 
an additional investment in gws in may resulted in the company owning approximately of gws which management believes  along with other qualitative factors considered  gives the company significant influence over gws 
as a result of the additional investment  the company is required to account for the investment in gws under the equity method of accounting and to retroactively restate its previously issued consolidated financial statements to reflect the equity method of accounting  in accordance with apb the company periodically evaluates the investment in gws to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment  including the net book value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
examples of such impairment indicators include  but are not limited to gws actual results of operations  actual results of operations compared to forecast  working capital requirements  additional third party equity investment  if any  and other considerations 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value  the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
for other than temporary impairments  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value 
in the second quarter of  the investment was adjusted for a decline in value judged to be other than temporary of  deterioration or changes in gws business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods and the impairment adjustments may be material 
in fact  the company made an additional  investment in gws in february  which will increase its ownership in gws to approximately  for which the company expects that it will take an impairment charge of approximately  in the first quarter of long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows 
table of contents from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income 
determining the amount of stock based compensation requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of this model requires us to make estimates for the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
changes in any of these assumptions may have an impact on the amount of stock based compensation recorded 
product warranties the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a significant portion of the deferred tax assets is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if the tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold then it is not recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with fin  the company accrues interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the company s adoption of fin as of january  did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents contingencies from time to time  we receive notices for product failure claims or that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others or for other matters 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
in making this assessment  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a loss in accordance with fas in determining the amount of the loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  if any  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position
