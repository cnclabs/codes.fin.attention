overview pharmathene is a biodefense company engaged in the business of development and commercialization of medical countermeasures against biological and chemical weapons 
in addition to our own research efforts  we collaborate with pharmaceutical companies to support clinical development of product candidates 
the company has two products under development valortim  a fully human monoclonal antibody an identical population of highly specific antibodies produced from a single clone for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection  and protexia  which mimics a natural bioscavenger for the treatment or prevention of nerve agent poisoning by organophosphate compounds which include nerve gases and pesticides 
our lead product candidate  valortim  is a fully human monoclonal antibody designed to protect against and treat human inhalation anthrax  the most lethal form of the infection caused by the bacillus anthracis bacterium 
the company is co developing valortim with medarex  inc  a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing fully human antibody based therapeutic products  and will share with medarex any profits derived from sales of valortim 
preclinical trials in animal models have demonstrated valortim to be effective prophylactically and therapeutically for inhalation anthrax infection 
the company and medarex have completed dosing of healthy volunteers in a phase i open label  dose escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability  immunogenicity eliciting an undesired immune response  and pharmacokinetics the study of absorption  metabolism and action of drugs of a single dose of valortim administered intravenously or intramuscularly 
no drug related serious adverse events were reported 
final results from the phase i trial were presented at the infectious disease society of america meeting in october valortim was granted fast track status by the us food and drug administration the fda  which may permit the company to submit portions of a biologics license application bla or efficacy supplement before the complete bla is submitted 
this can expedite the review process depending upon whether the fda has sufficient resources to review the portions submitted 
in addition  valortim was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of inhalation anthrax 
protexia  the company s second product candidate  is a recombinant form that is  produced using genetic engineering technology of human butyrylcholinesterase  a naturally occurring enzyme bche  for use in the prophylaxis and treatment of organophosphate chemical nerve agent poisoning 
preclinical trials in animal models suggest that protexia may be effective prophylactically and therapeutically for chemical nerve agent poisoning 
the company plans to continue preclinical animal studies of protexia through and file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda in the procurement process for the scale up development and sale of protexia is already underway with the us department of defense the dod  the department charged with purchasing biodefense countermeasures for military use 
the dod requested competitive bids in a request for proposal an rfp for a recombinant form of bche drug for the prophylaxis treatment of chemical nerve agent poisoning  which the company submitted in november in september  the company was awarded a multi year contract by the dod 
the contract provides an initial million for the advanced development of protexia through march and  thereafter  the us government  in its sole discretion  may elect to continue development assistance with further funding of million 
assuming development milestones are met and contract extensions are exercised by the us government  in its sole discretion  and that it elects to procure an initial  doses of protexia from pharmathene  the company could receive up to million in funding including the million for advanced development 
for the next several years  we believe our main customer will be national governments  primarily the united states government 
currently  the united states government can purchase critical biodefense products prior to fda approval under project bioshield for the united states strategic national stockpile sns 
based on available information  the company has performed an in depth analysis of the factors  including comparisons to competitors products  and has developed revenue and cost projections to the united states government for sales to the us and other governments 
based on our evaluation we believe sales can commence during or before prior to the merger  when our operating subsidiary  pharmathene us  was a privately held corporation  our operations since inception in march were financed primarily through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes  and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
in addition to the trust funds obtained in the merger  any  or all  of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to fund our future capital requirements 
recent events purchase and sale agreement on march   pharmathene entered into a sale and purchase agreement the purchase agreement with avecia biologics limited and certain of its affiliates collectively  avecia for the acquisition of all of the assets related to avecia s vaccines business which includes a second generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine  a recombinant dual antigen plague vaccine and a third generation rpa anthrax vaccine program the acquisition 
in consideration for the acquisition  pharmathene has agreed to pay avecia the following i million exclusive of vat at the time of the consummation of the acquisition the initial consideration subject to a working capital adjustment whereby the initial consideration shall be reduced or increased by an amount equal to the shortfall or excess over  plus ii an additional million exclusive of vat payable upon the earlier to occur of a the completion of a financing transaction in which pharmathene receives gross proceeds of not less than million and b the first anniversary of the consummation of the acquisition the deferred consideration which payment is to be secured by a letter of credit  plus iii additional contingent amounts payable upon the occurrence of certain events the milestone consideration as follows million upon the entry by pharmathene into a multi year funded contract with the us department of defense or other agency or representative or sub contractor of the us government for the further development of avecia s pneumonic and bubonic plague ryp vaccine as a result of a a resources allocation decision of the resource allocation review board and the resource allocation advisory committee of the us department of defense or b some other similar substantial funding in excess of million including the value of any option elements within such contract  and million upon the entry by pharmathene into a multi year funded development contract to be issued by the biological advanced research and development authority part of the us department of health and human services under solicitation number rfp barda for the further development of avecia s anthrax rpa vaccine  and million upon the entry by pharmathene into a contract or contracts for the supply of rpa vaccine into the strategic national stockpile  and of net sales as defined under the purchase agreement of rpa vaccine made by pharmathene to the us government within the period of ten years from the consummation of the acquisition after the first million doses  and of net sales as defined under the purchase agreement of third generation anthrax vaccine made by pharmathene to the us government within the period of ten years from the consummation of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  pharmathene and avecia have agreed to enter into certain ancillary agreements upon the consummation of the acquisition including  without limitation  transitional services agreements  laboratory facilities agreements  master services agreement  supply agreement and subcontract agreement which  in each case  provide for services to be performed by avecia for pharmathene both on a transitional and on a going forward basis 
one of such agreements is a long term manufacturing agreement for the supply by avecia of the vaccines and component ingredients comprising the vaccines business purchased by pharmathene in the acquisition 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  consummation of the acquisition is conditioned upon  among other customary conditions  the receipt of all consents  approvals and material permits i for the transfer by novation of avecia s contracts with the defence science and technology laboratory  an agency of the uk ministry of defence  ii for the entry into a subcontract with respect to avecia s contracts with the national institutes of health  an agency of the us government  and iii for the transfer whether by novation or assignment of a particular grant from the national institutes of health referred to as the challenge grant 
on march   avecia received a letter from the dstl advising avecia of the recent resource allocation decision of the us department of defense that the dod had decided not to fund avecia s plague vaccine candidate beyond the current contractual commitment 
the parties are engaged in discussions to amend the terms of the purchase agreement to accommodate this change in circumstances 
the parties anticipate a closing in early april 
consent and first loan modification agreement as previously disclosed  pharmathene is a party to a million secured credit facility evidenced by a loan and security agreement  dated as of march  the loan agreement  with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation together the lenders 
under the credit facility  the company has borrowed million which bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  restrict the company s ability to undertake certain acquisitions  incur certain indebtedness or make certain investments 
as a consequence  pharmathene sought to obtain the consent of its lenders to the acquisition and entered into a consent and first loan modification agreement  dated as of march   with the lenders the loan modification agreement pursuant to which  among other things  the lenders consented to the acquisition provided that i pharmathene or its uk subsidiary involved in the acquisition is the surviving entity in the acquisition  ii the total initial cash consideration upon the consummation of the acquisition does not exceed million  iii the consummation of the acquisition will not otherwise result in an event of default as defined under the loan agreement  after giving effect to the acquisition and iv within days following the consummation of the acquisition  pharmathene shall cause its uk subsidiary to become a co borrower or a secured guarantor under the loan agreement

it is contemplated that silicon valley bank will issue the letter of credit in the amount of million securing the deferred consideration payable under the purchase agreement

liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary cash requirements are to fund our research and development programs  to fund general corporate overhead and to fund the acquisition of avecia s vaccines business 
our cash requirements could change materially as a result of changes in our business and strategy 
these changes could arise from the company s management team s evaluation of our business strategy  the progress of our research and development activities and clinical programs  licensing activities  acquisitions  divestitures or other corporate developments 
prior to the merger when our operating subsidiary  pharmathene us  was a privately held corporation  operations since inception in march primarily through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
in addition to the use of the trust funds obtained in the merger  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to fund our future capital requirements 
in evaluating alternative sources of financing  we consider  among other things  the dilutive impact  if any  on our stockholders  the ability to leverage stockholder returns through debt financing  the particular terms and conditions of each alternative financing arrangement and our ability to service our obligations under such financing arrangements 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that pharmathene will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses and expects to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities 
the company does not have commercial products and  given the substantial costs relating to the development of pharmaceutical products  has limited capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional funds to support our research and development efforts 
although the company continues to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to secure financing through government contracts and grants 
continuation of pharmathene as a going concern is dependent upon  among other things  the success of the company s research and development programs and our ability to obtain adequate financing 
the company s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents for the company were million and million at december  and  respectively

on march   the company entered into a million credit facility with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation 
under the credit facility  the company borrowed million which loan bears interest at the rate of per annum 
pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement evidencing the credit facility  the company made monthly payments of interest only through september  and now makes monthly payments of principal and interest over the remaining month term of the loan

the company has made principal repayments of million through december  future cash needs the company has financed our operations since inception in march primarily through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
any  or all  of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to fund the company s future capital requirements 
the company s future capital requirements and liquidity will depend on many factors including  but not limited to  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and any future change in our business strategy 
the company expects to fund its development activities for protexia primarily using the funds available from the contract with the dod 
under the agreement  the dod has agreed to fund up to million of development costs as incurred over a three year period 
management believes this funding will be sufficient to complete the development of protexia 
in connection with the collaboration with medarex for the development of valortim  we have expended million of our own funds and medarex has received million in grants from the united states government 
on september   pharmathene was awarded a million contract for the advanced development of valortim from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  niaid and the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda 
management believes that the remaining costs for this development program will be financed through additional grants to the company not medarex anticipated to be received from the united states government and from the company s available cash 
however  as a result of the contemplated acquisition of avecia  in addition to other future payments that may be payable to avecia based on the achievement of certain milestones  we have agreed to pay to avecia million upon the closing of the acquisition and an additional million upon the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and the consummation of a financing transaction in which we receive gross proceeds of not less than million 
pharmathene has incurred cumulative net losses and expects to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities 
it does not have commercial products and has limited capital resources 
to the extent that our losses continue at the current level  if we do not access additional funding through contracts with the us government  we may need to seek additional financing through a combination of collaborative agreements  strategic alliances  research grants  equity and debt financing as soon as twelve months from the date of the closing of the avecia acquisition 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to secure financing from anticipated government contracts and grants 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into facility and equipment operating lease agreements 
the company s obligations under these agreements are presented in this section under contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
adoption of fasb r regarding share based payments the fasb issued fas r  which requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values 
costs of all share based payments are recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie usually the vesting period and charged to the operating expense associated with that employee 
the company adopted fas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
because the company has a limited history as a publicly held company  it has based such measurements as volatility on publicly held companies similar to the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all terms and conditions of the agreements providing for the receipt of revenues have been met including persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for reimbursable cost research grants  the company recognizes revenue as costs are incurred and appropriate regulatory approvals have been obtained or approval criteria are met for invoicing the related government agency 
all of the grant revenue the company recognized historically was received under cost reimbursement grants from the us government to fund the development of pharmaceutical products for biodefense applications in addition  reimbursed costs are subject to review and adjustment by the granting agency 
as the company develops experience with contracting authorities and as our incurred cost submissions are reviewed and approved by the responsible government authorities  estimates of the assumptions related to these uncertainties may change 
research and development expenses research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
such costs are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets when the company acquires development products  it allocates the purchase price  including expenses and assumed liabilities  to tangible and intangible assets 
the portion allocated to intangible assets may be allocated to trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
the company estimates the useful lives of the assets by considering the remaining life of the patents  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other related factors 
because of the nature of pharmaceutical research  and particularly because of the difficulties associated with efficacy studies in humans related to the bioterrorist products with which the company works and the government s related funding provisions  factors that affect the estimate of the life of the asset are often more uncertain than other non bioterrorist pharmaceutical research 
on an annual basis  the company assesses recoverability of intangibles from future operations  using undiscounted future cash flows derived from the intangible assets 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value  which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows  in certain situations  where the carrying value is dependent upon the outcome of a single study and that study is unsuccessful  that impairment may be significant in amount and immediate in timing 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with leases  research and development arrangements  collaborative development obligations and long term debt contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating facility leases    research and development agreements   notes payable  including interest   total contractual obligations   this table does not include any royalty payments of future sales of products subject to license agreements the company has entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known
