item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described under risk factors  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a defense electronics manufacturer and supplier that designs  develops and manufactures innovative electronic components and systems for inclusion in high technology products for the defense and aerospace markets 
our defense electronics solutions include advanced semiconductor and state of the art multi chip packaged components  circuit card assemblies and electromechanical assemblies  as well as our proprietary process for applying anti tamper protection to mission critical semiconductor components 
our customers  which include military prime contractors and the contract manufacturers who work for them in the united states  europe and asia  outsource many of their defense electronic components and systems to us as a result of the combination of our design  development and manufacturing expertise 
executive summary continuing operations net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to net sales of million for fiscal net sales increased million  or  from fiscal primarily due to higher sales of our anti tamper and ball grid array bga products which more than offset decreases in modules and power pc products  as well as our electromechanical assemblies 
a key indicator of our future sales is the amount of new orders received compared to current net sales  known as the book to bill ratio 
during the year  we received new orders of approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of bookings were consistent throughout the year and we expect bookings to increase in fiscal new orders for our anti tamper process technology were approximately million for the year and we had sales of approximately million 
we currently expect to see continued growth for anti tamper technology products over the next several years 
our gross margins were approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the decrease is due to a lower margin product mix and higher costs associated with product yield as well as startup costs associated with circuit card assembly introduction 
our gross margin historically has been a blend of margins derived from custom and standard microelectronic components and electromechanical assemblies 
we have traditionally experienced a range of margins in the to range depending on the custom versus standard concentration 
as we move vertical with the introduction of military grade circuit card assemblies  which are more price sensitive  we expect overall margins to center around 
income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september  was million  or per diluted share  compared to income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the million decrease was primarily due to the million in expenses related to severance costs and expenses in connection with the departure of our ceo 
on august   we announced the resignation of hamid shokrgozar  chairman  chief executive officer and director to pursue other opportunities 
we recorded severance related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal following his departure  edward a 
white  the company s founder  was elected chairman of the board and the board of directors appointed roger a 
derse  vice president and chief financial officer  and dante v 
tarantine  executive vice president  sales and marketing to perform the duties of the office of the president 
the office of the president reports to a committee of the board headed by mr 
white 
the board also formed a special committee to evaluate all possible strategic alternatives 

table of contents discontinued operations on march   the board of directors authorized the disposal of the interface electronics division ied and the commercial microelectronic product lines 
on september   the board of directors authorized the disposal of the display systems division dsd 
these decisions resulted from an effort to streamline the company s businesses to focus on product lines where the company has superior technical knowledge  specialized manufacturing capabilities and an ongoing commitment to research and development 
with the streamlining of our business operations  we are now reporting one segment defense electronics 
we believe this course of action will increase shareholder value and allow us to focus on growing our business both organically and through other alternatives  including potential acquisitions 
as a result of our decision to dispose of these product lines  we have accounted for them as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are classified as assets and liabilities held for sale 
our discontinued operations generated million in revenues in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue of million  or  was primarily due to the economic downturn which affected demand for our tablet pc  appliance  and other consumer products 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or  compared to million  or  in fiscal the decrease was a result of lower revenues and lower overhead absorption 
loss from discontinued operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in the loss was due to the lower gross profit and the million write off of goodwill related to our dsd reporting unit which more than offset the million write down of customer relationship intangibles related to our ids acquisition and the savings from our reductions in force and other cost reductions taken in fiscal in fiscal  we also recorded million  net of tax  for loss on sale of discontinued operations 
based on market factors and the consideration being discussed in connection with the disposal of the product lines  we recorded impairment charges related to the customer relationship and existing technology intangibles of the ied and commercial microelectronics reporting units  fixed assets at ied and inventory at ied and in our commercial microelectronic product lines 
we currently expect to complete the disposal of our ied and commercial product lines by the end of the second quarter of fiscal and dsd by the end of fiscal including the charges in connection with the disposal of the product lines discussed above  net loss for the fiscal year ended september  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal strategic initiatives for continuing operations and a fourth quarter update of their progress pursuit of circuit card assembly cca for military customers 
update expansion in cca for defense customers continued with several advanced design and development orders as well as production orders 
quoting activity for the fourth quarter also increased over the third quarter of fiscal next generation anti tamper at technology 
update at technology development has continued with advances in protection of sensitive data 
as this business involves classified programs  these programs are generally not discussed 
quoting activity increased during the fourth quarter over the previous quarter  with several production orders booked 
continue the stock repurchase program 
update in april  we announced our third repurchase program to acquire up to an additional  or approximately million shares  of the company s outstanding common stock 
the duration of the program is twenty four months and will be funded from available working capital 
the timing and amount of any purchases under this program will depend on market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
during the third quarter we purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
no further purchase activity occurred during the fourth quarter 
resumption of the program is under evaluation 
pursuing strategic alternatives 
update the company s previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives under the supervision of the independent special committee of its board is actively underway 

table of contents the company continues to work closely with its financial advisor jefferies quarterdeck  a division of jefferies co 
to identify opportunities to enhance stockholder value 
wilson sonsini goodrich rosati  professional corporation  is acting as legal advisor 
as previously indicated  the process involves a thorough review of strategic alternatives  including wedc continuing as an independent public company  merging with or acquiring another public or private defense electronics company  or being acquired by a strategic or financial investor 
the special committee is giving due consideration and deliberation with respect to all opportunities that are available to the company with the goal of identifying what it believes is the best strategy for the company 
we believe the company s realignment to be exclusively focused as a defense electronics manufacturer and supplier coupled with its positive cash flow  substantial cash reserves and lack of debt allows the company substantial flexibility to conduct a thorough process with a focus on creating long term shareholder value 
the committee is committed to completing the process expeditiously as possible  while ensuring that all alternatives are given appropriate consideration

selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase resulted from an increase in general and administrative expenses of million  offset by a decrease in selling expenses of million over the comparable period 
general and administrative expenses increased mainly because of million in severance related costs in connection with the departure of our ceo and million of payroll related expenses 
selling expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in commissions as the commission percentage decreased from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately as compared with for the prior year 
the increase was caused by the higher expenses in fiscal due to the continued compliance requirements related to the sarbanes oxley act  the expense related to the adoption of sfas r and the restructuring of our business  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to average between and of net sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales have been approximately to of net sales over the past three years 
we are committed to the research and development of new and existing products and expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of net sales in the future 
ongoing product development projects include new product designs for various types of memory products including ddr ii  ddr iii  flash and microprocessors  and ball grid arrays using these semiconductors  continuing development of anti tamper technologies  and advanced custom designs for use in defense markets 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances invested primarily in money market accounts

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to the shipment of increased orders received in recent quarters as we experienced a greater demand for our products

selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million  for the year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in selling expenses of million  offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of million over the comparable period 
selling expenses increased primarily due to the hiring of additional sales executives to support our long term growth and higher commissionable sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased mainly because of lower compensation expense 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenditures for our next generation anti tamper technology

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of september  totaled approximately million and was primarily invested in money market accounts 
during fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million versus million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense related to employee stock awards  primarily as a result of the million of severance costs in connection with the departure of our ceo 
depreciation totaled approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we expect depreciation to remain consistent with the level in fiscal accounts receivable in fiscal increased approximately million from fiscal  primarily as a result of the timing of invoicing and receipts 
days sales outstanding at september  was days  which was lower than the days at september  our days sales outstanding typically approximates days 
inventories increased approximately million from fiscal year inventory of approximately million as of september  represents days of inventory on hand  a decrease from days on hand at september  the levels of inventory fluctuate based on changes in expected production requirements  the fulfillment of orders and availability of raw materials 
inventory amounts will generally take several quarters to adjust to significant changes in future sales 
also  as lead times for raw materials increase  we are required to purchase larger amounts of inventory per order and hold it for longer periods of time 
this has the effect of increasing the number of days of inventory on hand 
we expect to fund any increases in inventory caused by sales growth or manufacturing planning requirements from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased approximately million from the end of fiscal this was primarily due to the prepayment of income taxes 
accrued expenses as of september  decreased approximately million from the end of fiscal accrued salaries and benefits were approximately million higher at september  compared to the end of fiscal due to higher accrued compensation 
other accrued expenses were approximately million lower  primarily due to the decrease in income taxes payable and accrued commissions 
deferred revenue at september  was approximately million  and included approximately million of advance payments from customers 
purchases of property  plant and equipment during the year ended september  totaled approximately million  with million remaining in accounts payable at year end 
in connection with our decision to consolidate our phoenix locations  we entered into a new ten year operating lease for the expanded headquarters microelectronic building in fiscal the project and the consolidation were completed in the second quarter of fiscal and we incurred approximately million in improvements 
we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we expect to fund our pension obligation through returns on plan assets and our contributions to the plan over the next several years 
actual contributions will be dependent on the actual investment returns during that period 
while the current market conditions could have an adverse effect on our plan investments  any additional required contribution is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and we expect to fund such contributions from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
we contributed million to the pension plan in fiscal year we believe that funding the plan over the next several years will not significantly impact our liquidity 

table of contents an additional million of cash was received pursuant to common stock options exercised throughout fiscal year we purchased  pursuant to two separate stock repurchase programs  a total of approximately million shares  or  of our then outstanding common stock 
the number of shares repurchased under these programs in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
all repurchases were funded from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
on april   we announced our third repurchase program to acquire up to an additional  or approximately  million shares  of our then outstanding common stock 
the timing and amount of any repurchases under the program will depend on market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
during the fiscal year ended september   we repurchased  shares under this program for a total cost of million  inclusive of commissions and fees 
the duration of the program is twenty four months and any repurchases will be funded from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
on april   we entered into a million revolving line of credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na borrowings  if any  under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the lower of the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or the jpmorgan chase bank  na prime rate 
a commitment fee of is charged on the unused portion of the line 
the line of credit expires on march  this agreement replaced the previous jpmorgan chase bank  na loan and security agreement that expired on march  on august   we entered into a second modification agreement to our revolving line of credit agreement the amendment to the credit agreement 
the primary purpose of the amendment to the credit agreement was to amend the definition of net income  which is used in one of our financial covenants  to provide that the impact of any extraordinary non cash gains or losses  determined in accordance with gaap  and any non cash goodwill impairments or non cash gains or losses on sale of discontinued operations are excluded from the determination of net income 
taking into account the amendment to the credit agreement  we are in compliance with all debt covenant requirements contained in our revolving line of credit agreement 
as of september   there were no borrowings against the revolving line of credit  and we have not borrowed against any credit facility since april we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including expected cash flows from operating activities  existing cash balances  existing credit facilities and other financing sources  will satisfy our expected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations we have entered into certain long term contractual obligations in our continuing operations that will require various payments over future periods as follows in thousands payments due by period as of september  less than more than total year years years years operating leases pension funding total contractual obligations we also have the following obligations related to discontinued operations total  less than year  years we are committed to meeting the annual minimum funding requirements relating to our pension plan  which covers active employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
we contributed million to the pension plan in fiscal year we do not expect minimum funding requirements to be material 
we may also make contributions to the pension plan in excess of the minimum funding requirements during any year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pension fund 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
contingencies from time to time  we are subject to claims and litigation incident to our business 
there are currently no such pending proceedings to which we are a party that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following items revenue recognition we sell defense electronic products primarily to military prime contractors 
a portion of our products are also sold through distributors or resellers 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer exists  title to the product has passed to the customer usually occurs at time of shipment  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the related billing is reasonably assured 
advance payments from customers are deferred and recognized when the related products are shipped 
revenue relating to products sold to distributors or resellers who either have return rights or where the company has a history of accepting product returns are deferred and recognized when the distributor or reseller sells the product to the end customer 
we also provide limited design services pursuant to related customer purchase orders and generally recognize the associated revenue as such services are performed 
however  it may be deferred until certain elements are completed 
we may from time to time enter into certain arrangements that contain multiple elements such as performing limited design services accompanied with follow on manufacturing of related products 
we allocate revenue to the elements based on relative fair value  and recognize revenue for each element when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
arrangements with multiple elements that are not considered separate units of accounting require deferral of revenue until certain other elements have been delivered or the services have been performed 
the amount of the revenue recognized is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements  and whether the elements are considered separate units of accounting  as well as management s judgments regarding the fair values of the elements used to determine relative fair values 
excess and obsolete inventory historically  we have experienced fluctuations in the demand for our products based on cyclical fluctuations in the defense electronics markets 
these fluctuations may cause inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and record provisions to write down such inventories to net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and they do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from 
table of contents our estimates 
continuing operation write offs against the allowance were in fiscal   in fiscal and in fiscal defined benefit plan we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
to account for the cost of this plan  we make estimates concerning the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of investment income expected to be earned in the future 
we base our related estimates using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as projections for future returns on such investments 
if the actual returns on plan assets do not equal the estimated amounts  we may have to fund future benefit obligations with additional contributions to the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the plan s future benefit obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the liabilities of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
we use published bond yields to estimate the discount rate used for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
goodwill recorded was million both at september  and september  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we also regularly evaluate intangible assets for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and evaluate the continued appropriateness of estimated future lives assigned to these assets 
stock based compensation expense with the adoption of sfas r  we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability by assessing our forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which became effective for the company on september  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return 
table of contents and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable  or adjustments to deferred taxes  or both

the company does not currently have an application for this statement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we had no borrowings on our revolving line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank  na should we borrow against the line  interest charged on these borrowings would be at the lower of the jpmorgan chase bank  na prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
during fiscal  the bank s prime rate averaged and was as of september  we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
we are also subject to fluctuations in the libor 
as of september   the libor was approximately 
should we begin borrowing against the credit line  annual interest expense at would be approximately  for every million borrowed 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by approximately  per million borrowed on an annual basis 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk on foreign customer purchase orders we accept payment in us dollars only or commodity price risk
