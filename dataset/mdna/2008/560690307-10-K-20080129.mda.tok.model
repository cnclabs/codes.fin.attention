item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of interactive entertainment products 
we sell our products primarily to large retail chains  specialty retail stores  video game rental outlets and distributors 
we also sell our products internationally through distribution agreements with other publishers 
we have developed our retail and distribution network over our year history 
we publish video game software for most major interactive entertainment hardware platforms  including nintendo s wii  game boy advance  or gba  ds  micro and gamecube  sony s playstation  or ps  and playstation portable  or psp  microsoft s xbox  xbox and the personal computer  or pc 
our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points  from lower priced value titles to more expensive premium titles 
in some instances  these titles are based on licenses of well known properties  and in other cases based on original properties 
we collaborate and enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of the majority of our video games 
majesco sales inc was incorporated in under the laws of the state of new jersey 
on december   majesco sales inc completed a reverse merger with majesco holdings inc formerly  connectivcorp then a publicly traded company with no active operations 
majesco holdings inc was incorporated in under the laws of the state of delaware 
as a result of the merger  majesco sales inc became a wholly owned subsidiary and the sole operating business of the public company 
on april   majesco sales inc was merged into majesco holdings inc  and majesco holdings inc 
changed its name to majesco entertainment company 
during  we revised our business model and shifted our product strategy away from capital intensive premium console games to a focus on lower cost games for both console and handheld 
table of contents systems targeting mass market consumers 
we believe this strategy allows us to capitalize on our strengths and expertise while reducing some of the cost and risk associated with publishing a large number of premium console titles 
we continue to publish titles for popular handheld systems such as the gba  ds and psp 
we also publish software for nintendo s wii console released in late as we believe this platform allows us to develop games within our cost parameters  while enabling us to reach mass market consumers 
in addition  we continue to opportunistically look for titles to publish on the pc and other home console systems 
net revenues 
our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video game titles 
we primarily provide video games for the mass market and casual game player 
we work with third party development studios to develop our own proprietary titles and we also license rights to properties from third parties 
in  we announced the opening of our own development studio 
however  we expect to continue to use third party studios for the significant majority of our development 
we have also developed  manufactured and marketed a variety of digital media peripherals and applications including plug and play video game systems 
our revenues are recognized net of reserves for price protection and other allowances 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization of software development costs and license fees 
a significant component of our cost of sales is product costs 
these are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media  royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales 
gross profit 
gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization of software development and license fees 
development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales 
the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume  which varies by title 
our value titles are generally characterized as having lower gross profit margin potential than premium titles as a result of their lower sales price  and carry lower financial risk associated with the recovery of upfront development and license fees as compared with premium game titles 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses relate principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers  testing new products and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle 
costs incurred are employee related  may include equipment and are not allocated to cost of sales 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses  the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs 
a large component of these expenses relate to marketing and promotion expenses  which includes certain customer marketing allowances 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs  including corporate executive and support staff  general office expenses  professional fees and various other overhead charges 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  typically represent the second largest component of our general and administrative expenses 
these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchase order financing arrangements 
benefit provision for income taxes 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
since the company has a history of losses  a full valuation allowance has been established under the provisions of sfas no 
and the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for its net operating loss carryforwards until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when title and risk of loss are transferred and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
in order to recognize revenue  we must not have any continuing obligations and it must also be probable that we will collect the accounts receivable 
revenues  including sales to resellers and distributors  are recognized when these conditions are met 
reserves for price protection and other allowances 
we generally sell our products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  we may provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular advertisement  are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue 
generally our price protection for premi um priced titles is higher than that needed for our value titles 
our reserves for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience  current sell through of retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the interactive entertainment market  the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
however  actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of c ompetitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  this will result in a change in our reserves  which would impact the net revenues and or selling and marketing expenses we report 
for the twelve month periods ended october    and  we provided allowances for future price protection and other allowances of million  million  and million  respectively 
the fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above 
we do not have significant exposure to credit risk as we factor our receivables to a third party that generally buys our receivables without recourse 

table of contents inventory 
inventory  which consists principally of finished goods  is stated at the lower of cost as determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
we estimate the net realizable value of slow moving inventory on a title by title basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales 
software development costs and prepaid license fees 
software development costs include development fees  most often in the form of milestone payments made to independent video game developers for development services 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and it is determined that such costs should be recoverable against future revenues 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs 
prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in association with our products 
minimum g uaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset prepaid license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract when no significant performance remains with the licensor 
capitalized software development costs classified as non current relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date 
commencing upon a related product s release  capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii the straight line method 
the amortization period is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product 
the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate 
the following criteria are used to evaluate expected product performance historical performance of comparable products using comparable technology  orders for the product prior to its release  and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized c osts 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred to complete and publish the product 
if revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than  and or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than  the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis  the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter  which could result in an impairment charge 
we recorded an expense of million  million and million for the twelve months ended october   and  respectively  related to development costs for projects which were either canceled  or for which full recoverability was not expected 
in the twelve month periods ended october   and  we charged million  million  and million  respectively  to cos t of sales for amortization of software development costs  prepaid license fees and royalties on products which were sold 
accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r on november  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we use the modified prospective transition method  which requires that compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employee s prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
commitments and contingencies 
the company accounts for commitments and contingencies in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company records a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable

net revenues for the year ended october  decreased to million from million in the comparable period last year

during  we released two minute video movies for the nintendo gba handheld system and the company changed its focus to handheld and console games with lower development  royalty and marketing expense requirements 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million in the same period last year 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the lower net revenues discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is primarily attributable to a decrease in software development and licensing fees as a percent of net sales  as a result of the company s shift in strategy away from publishing higher priced premium games 
product research and development expenses 
research and development costs decreased million to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the decrease is principally the result of a reduction in the number of quality assurance employees in january  as we changed our focus to games with shorter development times and relatively lower development costs 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in media and other marketing costs associated with premium games that were launched in the quarter ended january  in addition  the variable selling and marketing costs such as commissions  also decreased due to lower revenues in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october  general and administrative expenses were million  a decrease of million from million for the year 
table of contents ended october  the decrease is primarily due to lower legal and stock based compensation costs

we recorded million of stock based compensation expense related to sfas r during compared to million during settlements  loss on impairments and other expenses gains 
settlements  loss on impairments and other expenses gains increased from a loss of million for the year ended october  to a gain of million for the year ended october  the million increase is primarily due to a million non cash charge related to the settlement of litigation in and a decrease in gains on the settlement of accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges of million 
as discussed in item legal proceedings contained herein  during the quarter ended october   we entered into settlement agreements to settle certain litigations pending in the united states district court  district of new jersey i a securities class action brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the company s securities  ii a private securities action filed by trinad capital master fund  ltd  and iii a second action filed by trinad purportedly on behalf of the company 
under the terms of the settlement agreement in the securities class action  which is subject to notice to the shareholder class and court approval  our insurance carrier will make a cash payment and we will contribute shares of our common stock with a market value of million 
the shares being contributed to the settlement will be distributed to the settlement class if and when the court grants final approval to the settlement and the settlement becomes effective 
at this time  we cannot estimate the exact number of shares that will be contributed to the settlement  however  it will not be less than million shares 
further  if the average closing bid price of our common stock for the days prior to the settlement becoming effective is less than  we would have to issue additional shares to fulfill our obligation under the settlement  or could  under certain circumstances determine not to conclude the settlement and revert back to disputing the class claims 
during the twelve months ended october   we recorded a million charge in connection with the expected settlement of the class action litigation discussed above 
the charge is comprised of million  representing the fair value  on the date the settlement agreement was executed  of the common stock expected to be distributed when the settlement becomes effective  and million  representing the increase in the value of the shares since that date 
we will adjust the fair value of the liability to the fair value of the shares expected to be distributed at each balance sheet date and record the resulting change as a non cash charge to earnings in each period until the shares are distributed 
the settlement provides that if the fair value of the stock falls below million  we will have to issue additional shares  subject to certain limitations  with a fair market value equal to the amount of the decrease 
therefore  the liability will not be adjusted below million 
there is no assurance that the settlement described above will be achieved  and if not achieved  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our costs relating to the litigation 
any expenses incurred in connection with the litigation not covered by available insurance or any adverse resolution of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future viability of the company 
gains on settlement of liabilities for the year ended october  consist of the settlement of marketing accounts payable for less than the invoice amount 
gains on settlement of liabilities for the year ended october  consist of million related to negotiated reductions in royalty payments due for certain video and video game titles  million gain on the sale of the rights to certain video game titles  and million gain on the settlement of legal and marketing and development accounts payable for less than the invoice amount 
operating loss 
operating loss for the year ended october  was million  compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended october  the increase in operating 
table of contents loss of million  was primarily due to the increase of million in settlements  impairments and other expenses gains discussed above  partially offset by the positive impact of higher gross margin percentages and lower operating expenses of million 
interest and financing costs  net 
interest and financing costs decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the the decrease is the result of lower factoring fees and a reduction in the amount of inventory financing 
change in fair value of warrants 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  we recorded income of million for the twelve months ended october   reflecting the decrease in fair value of warrants issued in connection with a private placement of our equity securities in september income taxes 
we did not record any income tax benefit because realization of the resulting loss carryforwards cannot be assured 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended october  was million  a decrease of million from a net loss of million for the comparable period in the decrease in net loss was primarily due to a charge for the settlement of litigation in of million and decreased gain on settlement of liabilities and other gains of million  partially offset by lower operating expenses discussed above and a million decrease in impairment charges 
year ended october  versus year ended october  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million in the comparable period in the million increase is primarily due to increased international sales and a lower provision for price protection and other allowances on domestic sales 
the lower provision for price protection and other allowances is the result of a higher sell through percentage at retailers for titles released during the year ended october  this is reflective of our change in strategy of selling fewer premium games 
gross loss profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross loss of million in the prior year 
the increase of million is primarily due to a million charge to cost of sales during the year ended october  to recognize impairments in the carrying value of games for which orders received were significantly below expectations  a decrease in provisions for price protection and other allowances  and increased sales in europe 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to compared to in the prior year 
product research and development expenses 
for the year ended october  product research and development costs decreased million to million from million in the comparable period in the decrease is principally attributable to a lower number of quality assurance employees as a result of the fewer number of premium game projects currently in the development cycle 
selling and marketing expenses 
for the year ended october  total selling and marketing expenses were million  a million decrease from million for the comparable period last year 
the decrease is primarily the result of higher media costs related to premium games launched in the year ended october  during  we changed our strategy to focus on value titles which typically require lower expenditures for advertising and marketing than premium titles 
sales  selling and marketing as a percentage of net sales decreased to from in the same period in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million during the comparable period in the million increase is primarily due to higher non cash compensation costs related to the adoption of sfas r  partially offset by lower franchise taxes resulting from a lower asset base used to calculate the taxes and a decrease in one time charges related to severance 
for the year ended october  we recorded million of stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r effective november   and million for stock and warrants issued 
table of contents for services 
for the year ended october   we recorded a one time charge of million  primarily related to a below market stock option grant to our former chief executive officer 
this option grant was subsequently forfeited as part of his severance agreement 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended october  also include approximately million of legal settlements and related expenses 
other operating expenses 
during the year ended october  we recorded gains on settlement of liabilities of million  consisting of million related to negotiated reductions in royalties due for certain video and video game titles  million gain on the sale of the rights to certain video game titles and a million gain on the settlement of accounts payable for legal  marketing and development expenses for less than the invoiced amounts 
in addition  we charged operations million to write off capitalized costs related to games for which development plans were changed such that it is uncertain whether potential value of that development will be realized 
during the year ended october  we recorded a provision for a loss of million in connection with a proposed settlement with one of our distributors 
we do not have significant exposure to credit risk as our factor generally buys our receivables without recourse  however  during the year ended october   we recorded an accounts receivable write off of million related to customer bankruptcies 
in addition  during the year ended october  we recorded million of expense related to severance agreements and we charged operations million to write off all capitalized costs related to the development of video games that we had determined would not be commercially viable and for which development was stopped 
operating loss 
for the year ended october  we generated an operating loss of million  compared to an operating loss of million during the same period in the decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower selling and marketing expenses related to our shift in product strategy  a decrease in impairment of software development costs  and gains on settlement of liabilities 
interest and financing costs  net 
for the year ended october  interest and financing costs increased approximately million to million from million in the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the use of purchase order financing to purchase inventory and an increase in borrowing rates 
loss on foreign exchange contract 
during the year ended october  we recorded a loss of  related to a foreign exchange contract 
there were no comparable amounts recorded in the period 
income taxes 
as a result of the availability of loss carryforwards  we have not recorded any provisions for federal or state income taxes in the current period 
federal and state income taxes were provided for at a combined effective rate of in the fiscal year 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended october   net of a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets recorded in prior periods 
net loss 
for the year ended october   we generated a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in the same period in included in the loss for is a million charge related to the fair value of warrants exercised at a discount 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in historically  we have funded our operating losses through sales of our equity and use of our purchase order financing and factor arrangements 
we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of our equity securities in september while our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales  we may be required to modify that plan  or seek outside sources of financing if our operating and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
while management has already significantly reduced expenditure levels  in the event that we are unable to 
table of contents negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to further materially modify our business plan  including making further reductions in expenditures 
management believes it can operate under the existing level of financing for at least one year 
however  if the current level of financing was reduced and the company was unable to obtain alternative financing  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
during the second half of fiscal year  we had several major developments that ultimately led us to revise our business model and shift our product strategy away from capital intensive premium console games to a focus on value products and lower cost games for handheld systems 
in conjunction with our shift in strategy  we evaluated our existing portfolio of premium console titles in development and decided to sell our rights or cancel a number of these titles 
while this resulted in decreased revenues from premium game titles  these actions improved the financial position of the company by significantly reducing our future obligations and  in some instances  generating cash 
going forward  we will continue to publish titles for popular handheld systems such as the gba  ds and psp  as well as look for opportunistic titles that fit our business model for home consoles such as the wii and pcs 
we believe that a decreased emphasis on premium console titles  along with a renewed focus on value and handheld titles  will allow us to capitalize on our strengths and expertise 
although there can be no assurance  we expect this model will lessen the level of required working capital to support the plan 
while our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of october   we expect continued volatility in the use and availability of cash due to the seasonality of our business  timing of receivables collections and working capital needs necessary to finance our business and growth objectives 
to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables 
we also utilize purchase order financing through the factor and through a finance company to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
in connection with these arrangements  the finance company and the factor have a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
under our factoring agreement we have the ability to take cash advances against accounts receivable and inventory of up to million  and million in letters of credit 
the factor  in his sole discretion  can reduce the availability of financing at anytime 
in addition we have million of availability for letters of credit and purchase order financing with another lender 
factoring and purchase order financing 
as mentioned above  to provide liquidity  we take advances from our factor and utilize purchase order financing to fund the manufacturing of our products 
under the terms of our factoring agreement  we assign our accounts receivable to the factor 
the factor  in its sole discretion  determines whether or not it will accept a receivable based on its assessment of its credit risk 
once a receivable is accepted by the factor  the factor assumes substantially all of the credit risk associated with the receivable 
the factor is required to remit payments to us for the assigned accounts receivable in accordance with the terms of the assigned invoice  regardless of whether the factor receives payment on the receivable  so long as the customer does not have a valid dispute related to the invoice 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer less factor charges of of invoiced amounts for these credit and collection services 
manufacturers require us to present a letter of credit  or pay cash in advance  in order to manufacture the products required under a purchase order 
currently  we utilize letters of credit from a finance company which charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days  plus administrative fees 
our factor also provides purchase order financing at a cost of of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
when our liquidity position allows  we will pay cash in advance instead of utilizing purchase order financing 
this results in reduced financing and administrative fees associated with purchase order financing 
in addition  we may request that the factor provide us with cash advances based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
the factor may either accept or reject our request for advances at its 
table of contents discretion 
amounts to be paid to us by the factor for any assigned receivable are offset by any amounts previously advanced by the factor 
as our needs require  we may request that the factor advance of the eligible receivables  and advance of inventory up to a maximum of million 
the interest rate is prime plus 
advances from customers 
on a case by case basis  distributors and other customers have agreed to provide us with cash advances on their orders 
these advances are then applied against future sales to these customers 
in exchange for these advances  we offer these customers beneficial pricing or other considerations
