item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes 
our international operations are vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks as a result of our foreign operations 
to minimize the financial impact of these risks  we attempt to match the currency of our debt and operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams 
we occasionally enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures  but we do not speculate in foreign currencies 
because we conduct a large portion of our operations in foreign currencies  any increase in the value of the us dollar in relation to the value of applicable foreign currencies could potentially adversely affect our operating revenue when translated into us dollars 
vessel construction and repair projects are subject to risks  including delays and cost overruns  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our vessel construction and repair projects are subject to the risks of delay and cost overruns inherent in any large construction project  including shortages of equipment  unforeseen engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  and shortages of materials or skilled labor 
significant cost overruns or delays in connection with our repair projects would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
significant delays could also result in penalties under  or the termination of  most of the long term contracts under which we plan to operate our vessels 
our current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital  and our indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund our capital requirements 
expenditures required for the repair  certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age 
these expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain our fleet either by extending the economic life of existing vessels through major refurbishment or by acquiring new or used vessels 
our industry is highly competitive  which could depress vessel prices and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance 
we operate in a competitive industry 
the principal competitive factors in the marine support and transportation services industry include price  service and reputation of vessel operations and crews  national flag preference  operating conditions  suitability of vessel types  vessel availability  technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  safety and efficiency  complexity of maintaining logistical support  and cost of moving equipment from one market to another 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we have 
competitive bidding and downward pressures on profits and pricing margins could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the operations of our fleet may be subject to seasonal factors 
operations in the north sea are generally at their highest levels during the months from april to august and at their lowest levels during december to february 
vessels operating offshore southeast asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season  which moves across the asian continent between september and early march 
the monsoon season for a specific southeast asian location is generally about two months 
however  operations in any market may be affected by unusually long or short construction seasons due to  among other things  abnormal weather conditions  as well as market demand associated with increased drilling and development activities 
we are subject to war  sabotage and terrorism risk 
war  sabotage  and terrorist attacks or any similar risk may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including changes in the insurance markets  disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  refineries  electric generation  transmission and distribution facilities  offshore rigs and vessels  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 
war or risk of war may also have an adverse effect on the economy 
insurance coverage has been difficult to obtain in areas of terrorist attacks resulting in increased costs that could continue to increase 
we continually evaluate the need to maintain this coverage as it applies to our fleet 
instability in the financial markets as a result of war  sabotage or terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital and could also adversely affect the oil  gas and power industries and restrict their future growth 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key management personnel 
there is no assurance that these individuals will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key management personnel could adversely affect our operations 

item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item legal proceedings general various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be instituted or asserted against us 
although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe  based on discussions with legal counsel and in consideration of reserves recorded  that an unfavorable outcome of these legal actions would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of our operations 
we cannot predict whether any such claims may be made in the future

b effective january   we began expensing the costs associated with drydocks 
previously  these costs were capitalized and amortized over months 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of million  net of tax per basic and diluted common share 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item c earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding 
d ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  interest income  income tax benefit provision  and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items that we believe are non cash or non operational  consisting of i cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  ii debt refinancing costs  iii loss from unconsolidated ventures  iv minority interests  and v other income expense  net 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow data  a measure of liquidity or an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because they are widely used by security analysts  creditors  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
this information is a material component of certain financial covenants in debt obligations 
failure to comply with the financial covenants could result in the imposition of restrictions on our financial flexibility 
when viewed with gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculation provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt and meet our ongoing liquidity requirements 
ebitda is also a financial metric used by management as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations 
however  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies or comparable for other purposes 
also  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as non gaap financial measures  have material limitations as compared to cash flow provided by operating activities 
ebitda does not reflect the future payments for capital expenditures  financing related charges and deferred income taxes that may be required as normal business operations 
management compensates for these limitations by using our gaap results to supplement the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense interest income income tax benefit provision depreciation and amortization ebitda adjustments cumulative effect of change in accounting principle debt refinancing costs other adjusted ebitda includes foreign currency transaction adjustments 
e includes managed vessels in addition to those that are owned and chartered at the end of the applicable period 
see our fleet in part i  items and business and properties for further information concerning our fleet 
f average number of vessels is calculated based on the aggregate number of vessel days available during each period divided by the number of calendar days in such period 
includes owned and bareboat chartered vessels only  and is adjusted for additions and dispositions occurring during each period 
g excludes current portion of long term debt
