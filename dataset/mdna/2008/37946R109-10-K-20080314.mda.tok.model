item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of global partners lp should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of global partners lp and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview general we own  control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products in the northeast 
we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of gasoline  distillates such as home heating oil  diesel and kerosene and residual oil to wholesalers  retailers and commercial customers in the northeast 
in  we sold approximately billion of refined petroleum products 
we purchase our refined petroleum products primarily from domestic and foreign refiners wholesalers  traders and producers and sell these products in two segments  wholesale and commercial 
like most independent marketers of refined petroleum products  we base our pricing on spot physical prices and routinely use the nymex or derivatives to hedge our commodity risk inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives  we maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations 
we earn a margin by selling the product for physical delivery to third parties 
products and operational structure our products include gasoline  distillates and residual oil 
we sell gasoline to unbranded retail gasoline stations and resellers 
the distillates we sell are used primarily for fuel for trucks and off road construction equipment and for space heating of residential and commercial buildings 
we sell residual oil to major housing units  such as public housing authorities  colleges and hospitals and large industrial facilities that use processed steam in their manufacturing processes 
in addition  we sell bunker fuel  which we can custom blend  to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets 
we have increased our sales in the non weather sensitive components of our business  such as transportation fuels  however  we are still subject to the impact that warmer weather conditions may have on our home heating oil and residual oil sales 
our business is divided into two segments wholesale 
this segment includes sales of gasoline  distillates and residual oil to resellers of transportation fuels  home heating oil retailers and wholesale distributors 
commercial 
this segment includes sales and deliveries of unbranded gasoline  distillates and residual oil to customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial customers  primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms 
this segment also purchases  custom blends  sells and delivers bunker fuel and diesel to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets generally by barges 
our business activities are substantially comprised of purchasing  storing  terminalling and selling refined petroleum products 
in a contango market when product prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery to customers at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market when product prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices  we attempt to minimize our inventories to reduce commodity risk and maintain or increase net product margins 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for additional information related to commodity risk 
outlook this section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future  both in the short term and in the long term 
our results of operations and financial condition depend  in part  upon the following we commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions  though there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers of terminalling  storage and or marketing assets and related businesses 
in an effort to prudently and economically leverage our asset base  knowledge base and skill sets  management has also expanded its efforts to pursue businesses that are closely related to or significantly intertwined with our existing lines of business 
our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions 
we may be unable to make such accretive acquisitions for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts  we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or we are outbid by competitors 
in addition  we may consummate acquisitions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive  but that ultimately may not be accretive 
if any of these events were to occur  our future growth would be limited 
we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms that are favorable to us 
our financial results are generally better in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
demand for some refined petroleum products  specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes  is generally higher during november through march than during april through october 
we obtain a significant portion of our sales during these winter months 
therefore  our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally better than for the second and third quarters 
with lower cash flow during the second and third calendar quarters  we may be required to borrow money in order to maintain current levels of distributions to our unitholders 
warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil 
because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter  warmer than normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales 
energy efficiency  new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products 
increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil 
consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades 
we could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government mandated controls or regulation further promoting the use of cleaner fuels 
end users who are dual fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas 
other end users may elect to convert to natural gas 
during a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas  dual fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas 
residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas 
such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
new  stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regulating product quality specifications and other environmental matters 
the trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations 
we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
however  there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith 
in the first quarter of  we are experiencing the following events which  we believe  are leading to a significant negative impact on our results of operations refined petroleum product prices have continued to rise which we believe is contributing to the conversion to other products primarily natural gas from residual fuel and heating oil  heat conservation  and shifts to more fuel efficient  hybrid or alternative fuel vehicles and changes in driving habits 
adverse market conditions in our markets  including volatility and backwardation  have led to comparatively higher product supply costs and intensified competition from other wholesalers 
temperatures have been warmer during the first quarter of we have fewer fixed priced sales of heating oil in than in comparable prior periods  which we believe is due to higher refined petroleum product prices 
the opportunistic conversion of certain gasoline markets to ethanol in late and into has put us in a temporarily disadvantaged competitive position while our terminal infrastructure is being converted 
temporary logistical supply issues related to rail capacity  which began in and are continuing into the first quarter of  are adversely affecting the performance of our burlington  vermont facility 
results of operations evaluating our results of operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include net product margin  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  operating expenses  heating degree days  adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains and distributable cash flow 
net product margin we view net product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review net product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
we define net product margin as our sales minus product costs 
sales include sales of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and natural gas 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products that we sell and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
net product margin is a non gaap financial measure used by management and external users of our financial statements to assess our business 
net product margin should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our net product margin may not be comparable to net product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies 
gross profit we define gross profit as our sales minus product costs and terminal depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales 
sales include sales of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and natural gas 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products that we sell and all associated costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a expenses include marketing costs  corporate overhead  employee salaries and benefits  pension and k plan expenses  discretionary bonuses  non interest financing costs  professional fees and information technology expenses 
employee related expenses including employee salaries  discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes  and benefits  pension and k plan expenses are paid by our general partner which  in turn  is reimbursed for these expenses by us 
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals used in our business 
lease payments and storage expenses  maintenance and repair  utilities  taxes  labor and labor related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our system but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
degree day a degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption 
degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of f 
each degree of temperature above f is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below f is counted as one heating degree day 
degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long term multi year average  or normal  to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual 
degree days are officially observed by the national weather service and officially archived by the national climatic data center 
for purposes of evaluating our results of operations  we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the national weather service at its logan international airport station in boston  massachusetts 
adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit we use adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit to measure our financial performance on a per unit basis 
adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit is defined as net income after adding back the theoretical amount allocated to the general partner s interest as provided under emerging issues task force eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf and a non cash reduction in net income available to limited partners under eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf  divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted common and subordinated units  or limited partner units  during the period 
net income per diluted limited partner unit as dictated by eitf is theoretical and pro forma in nature and does not reflect the economic probabilities of whether earnings for an accounting period would or could be distributed to unitholders 
the partnership agreement does not provide for the quarterly distribution of net income  rather  it provides for the distribution of available cash  which is a contractually defined term that generally means all cash on hand at the end of each quarter after establishment of sufficient cash reserves required to operate our business 
accordingly  the distributions we historically paid and will pay in future periods are not impacted by net income per diluted limited partner unit as dictated by eitf the non cash reduction under eitf is the result of accounting for the sale of class b units see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
although eitf affects net income available to limited partners  it does not affect net income or distributable cash flow to limited partners  nor does it affect total unitholders equity 
adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income per diluted limited partner unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit may not be comparable to the adjusted net incomer per diluted limited partner unit or similarly titled measure of other companies 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains are used as a supplemental financial measures by management and external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to assess our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements  our financial performance without regard to financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners  our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale marketing and distribution of refined petroleum products business  without regard to financing methods and capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities 
adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains reflect the exclusion of the million gain on investment for the year ended december  see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains should not be considered alternatives to net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income  and these measures may vary among other companies 
therefore  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and net income as adjusted for one time gains may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
distributable cash flow distributable cash flow also is an important non gaap financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distribution 
distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow for the year ended december  reflects the exclusion of the million gain on investment see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
distributable cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or a similarly titled measure of other companies 
years ended december   and in the year ended december   we continued to broaden and strengthen our distribution network with the acquisitions of five refined products terminals and the leasing of an additional terminal 
in addition  we continued to broaden the non weather sensitive components of our business 
in may  we acquired three refined products terminals in albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont from exxonmobil oil corporation exxonmobil 
products distributed from these terminals primarily include gasoline  ultra low sulfur diesel and heating oil 
in november  we acquired two refined products terminals in glenwood landing and inwood  new york from exxonmobil 
products distributed from these terminals also include gasoline  ultra low sulfur diesel and heating oil 
also in november  we leased a terminal in providence  rhode island which has access to deepwater marine facilities 
refined petroleum product and natural gas prices rose throughout for the year ended december   prices for gasoline  heating oil  residual oil and natural gas increased   and  respectively  compared to temperatures were less than colder than normal for and colder than as measured by aggregate heating degree days 
in the year ended december   we continued to expand our higher margin product lines and broaden the non weather sensitive components of our business 
we completed two acquisitions in our bridgeport  connecticut terminal is used as a distribution point for diesel and home heating oil  and our macungie  pennsylvania terminal is used as a distribution point for diesel  gasoline and home heating oil 
refined petroleum product prices rose throughout most of but experienced significant declines in september and december 
for the year ended december   prices for gasoline  distillates and residual oil decreased  and  respectively 
temperatures were warmer than normal for in the year ended december   we completed our initial public offering  generating million in gross proceeds from the sale of over million common units representing limited partner interests of us including common units sold upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we had increased gross profits and improved margins across both our wholesale and commercial segments 
refined petroleum product prices continued to rise in from december  to december   published prices for distillates  gasoline and residual oil increased  and  respectively 
temperatures were lower than normal as measured by aggregate heating degree days 
during  we continued to concentrate on expanding our distillate  gasoline and residual oil businesses

consolidated sales our total sales for increased by  million  or  to  million compared to  million for the increase was driven primarily by our terminal acquisitions in albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont in may and  to a lesser extent  in glenwood landing and inwood  new york in november and in bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania in and an increase in refined petroleum product prices for compared to the prior year 
our aggregate volume of product sold increased by approximately million gallons  or  to  million gallons 
the increase in volume primarily includes increases of million and million gallons in gasoline and distillates  respectively  as a result of our terminal acquisitions and colder temperatures in compared to the increase in volume was offset by a million gallon decrease in residual oil  primarily due to conversion and fuel switching related to increased residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas and intensified competition in the marketplace 
the number of actual heating degree days increased by approximately to  compared to  for our gross profit for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to  primarily due to higher net product margins in distillates and residual oil 
the increase was offset by a decline in gasoline net product margins and an increase in depreciation on our terminals  which is included in cost of sales  as a result of our recent terminal acquisitions 
our total sales for increased by million  or  to  million compared to  million for the increase was due to our acquisitions of the bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania terminals and higher refined petroleum product prices during most of  despite a decrease of approximately million gallons  or  to  million gallons in aggregate volume of product sold 
the decrease in aggregate volume sold was primarily attributable to decreases of million and million gallons in distillates and residual oil  respectively  offset by a million gallon increase in gasoline 
the number of actual heating degree days declined in to  compared to  for our gross profit for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher net product margins in our wholesale segment 
wholesale segment distillates 
wholesale distillate sales for were  million compared to  million for the increase of  million  or  was due to an increase in volume sold and in refined petroleum product prices for compared to the prior year 
we attribute the increase in volume sold primarily to the terminal acquisitions in albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont in may and  to a lesser extent  in glenwood landing and inwood  new york in november  and in bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania in  as well as to temperatures that were colder for compared to the prior year 
our net product margin contribution from distillate sales increased by million  or  to million primarily as the result of margin expansion  volume expansion related to our and terminal acquisitions and additional volume expansion due to colder weather during compared to the prior year 
despite the increase in net product margin for  we had fewer fixed priced sales of heating oil in compared to  which we believe were due to higher refined petroleum product prices 
wholesale distillate sales for increased by million  or  to  million from  million for the increase was due to our acquisitions of the bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania terminals and higher distillate prices during most of  despite a decrease of in distillate volume sold for compared to we attribute the decrease in volume sold to a reduction in bulk sales transactions and the expiration of supply contracts in the ordinary course of business 
our net product margin contribution from distillate sales increased in by million  or  to million compared to the increase was  in part  the result of our ability to pass through to customers our increased costs related to sales and the introduction of specialty fuels ethanol and lower sulfur grades of diesel fuel into our marketplaces 
gasoline 
wholesale gasoline sales for were  million compared to  million for the increase of  million  or  was due primarily to our recent acquisition of the albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont terminals  our acquisition of the macungie  pennsylvania terminal  an increase in gasoline volume sold and higher prices 
our net product margin from gasoline sales decreased by million  or  to million for compared to we attribute the decrease in net product margin to the return of margins to more historical norms as the industry adjusted to the introduction of ethanol based gasoline  narrower net product margins generally  some initial start up supply costs at the albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont terminals and general market conditions 
wholesale gasoline sales for were  million compared to  million for the increase of million  or  was due to our acquisition of the macungie  pennsylvania terminal  higher gasoline prices for most of and an increase of in volume sold 
our net product margin from gasoline sales increased million  or  to million for compared to we attribute the increase in net product margin to an increase in our volume of sales  sales to higher margin customers and market dislocation associated with the introduction of ethanol 
residual oil 
wholesale residual oil sales for were million compared to million for the increase of million  or  was due to an increase in refined petroleum product prices  despite a decrease in residual oil volume sold  primarily due to conversion and fuel switching related to increased residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas and intensified competition in the marketplace 
our net product margin contribution from residual oil sales increased by million  or  to million for compared to wholesale residual oil sales for were million compared to million for the increase of million  or  was the result of higher residual oil prices for most of our net product margin contribution from residual oil sales decreased by million  or  to million for  primarily due to a per unit margin reduction 
commercial segment in our commercial segment  residual oil accounted for approximately  and of total commercial volume sold in  and  respectively 
distillates  gasoline and natural gas accounted for the remainder of the total volume sold 
commercial residual oil sales for decreased by compared to due to a decrease in volume sold 
we attribute the decrease in volume sold to the competitive pricing from natural gas and reductions in production by certain industry participants in our territory 
specifically  for compared to  prices for residual oil and heating oil increased and  respectively  while the price for natural gas increased 
commercial residual oil sales for decreased compared to due to a decrease in volume sold 
we attribute the decrease in volume sold to the competitive pricing from natural gas  warmer than normal weather conditions  reductions in production by certain cyclical industry participants in our territory and closure of plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increases of approximately million in salaries and million in employee related benefits  partly due to additional employees to support our recent terminal acquisitions  million in compensation cost on our long term incentive plan and million in other sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was offset by a decrease of approximately million in legal fees as a result of insurance reimbursement from insurance carriers for previously expensed legal fees 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for during the third quarter of  we paid million in special bonuses to certain officers and employees in connection with our initial public offering 
during  we had increases in accrued discretionary bonuses of million  professional and consulting fees of million  information technology expenses of million  insurance related fees of million  pension and deferred compensation expenses of million and expenses associated with becoming a public company  including increases in audit and tax review fees of approximately million  expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance  planning and documentation of million  director and officer insurance and fees of million and schedule k preparation and distribution expenses of million 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million in costs associated with operating our albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont terminals  million in costs associated with operating our bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania facilities  million in increased costs at our chelsea terminal  million in costs associated with operating our newly acquired glenwood landing and inwood  new york terminals  million in increased rent for additional storage and repair expenses at the capital terminal in east providence  rhode island  million in increased rent at our gateway terminal  million in additional costs at our south portland terminal  million in additional costs at our wethersfield terminal and million in other operating expenses 
the increase in expenses was offset by non recurring charges of approximately million at our new bedford terminal and pipeline repair and other expenses at our chelsea terminal incurred during operating expenses for increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million in costs associated with operating our newly acquired bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania facilities and the expansion of storage and delivery systems at an alternative location in new bedford  massachusetts 
we also had a million increase in rent for additional tankage at the capitol terminal in east providence  rhode island and million and million in pipeline repair expenses and other repair and maintenance expenses  respectively  at the terminal in chelsea  massachusetts 
amortization expense amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily the result of amortization related to intangible assets recognized as part of the albany  newburgh  glenwood landing and inwood  new york and burlington  vermont terminal acquisitions in see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest expense interest expense for increased by million  or  to million compared to million for we attribute the increase primarily to borrowing on our acquisition facility to fund the albany  newburgh  glenwood landing and inwood  new york and burlington  vermont terminal acquisitions in  higher average balances on our revolving line of credit due to higher refined petroleum product prices  increased inventory levels and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average interest rate for compared to interest expense for increased by million  or  to million compared to million for we attribute the increase to a rise in product prices for purchases throughout most of and the resulting increased costs of carrying inventory and accounts receivable 
other expense in  certain affiliates of the slifka family acquired certain outstanding interests in certain split dollar life insurance policies from global companies llc and affiliates for the aggregate amount of premiums that had been paid on these policies by global companies llc and affiliates on behalf of certain directors and their immediate family members 
additionally  one split dollar life insurance policy was surrendered in at the time of surrender  the cash value of the policy was less than the amount of premiums paid on it by global companies llc and affiliates  resulting in a loss of approximately million in the fourth quarter ended december  other income other income of approximately  and  for the year ended december  and for the period from january  through october   respectively  represented dividend income from our ownership interest in nymex holdings  inc along with our nymex seats 
no other income items were recognized for the period from october  through december  in march  we sold our investment in nymex holdings  inc along with our nymex seats and  as a result  other income was not recognized for the year ended december  see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
gain on sale of investment the million gain on sale of investment for the year ended december  represented the amount we realized on the march sale of our nymex holdings  inc and related seats 
see note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements and our capital expenditures 
cash generated from operations and our working capital revolving credit facility provide our primary sources of liquidity 
working capital increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  in  we and certain of our subsidiaries registered with the sec the issuance and sale  from time to time and in such amounts as is determined by market conditions and our needs  of up to million of our common units and debt securities of both us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we will use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities covered by this registration for general partnership purposes  which may include debt repayment  future acquisitions  capital expenditures and additions to working capital 
on may   we issued  class b units in a private placement from which we received gross proceeds of million 
the class b units were convertible into common units on a one for one basis 
in connection with the issuance of the class b units  we agreed to a discount in the purchase price of approximately million  which is the amount equal to the product of i the number of issued and outstanding class b units and ii  the amount of our first quarter per unit distribution that was paid to the common and subordinated unitholders on may  such discount was paid by us to the purchasers of the class b units substantially contemporaneously with the payment of our first quarter distribution 
on may   the class b units converted into common units on a one for one basis 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement described in note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec for the registration of  common units  which the sec declared effective on august  on february   we paid a cash distribution of million for the fourth quarter of to our common and subordinated unitholders of record as of the close of business february  contractual obligations we have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash 
the amounts of our contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years revolver loan obligations    operating lease obligations     capital lease obligations  other long term liabilities    total      includes principal and interest on our revolving line of credit at december  the revolving credit facility has a contractual maturity of april  and no payments are required prior to that date 
however  we repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements 
therefore  the current portion of the revolving credit facility included in the accompanying balance sheets is the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year  and the long term portion of the revolver is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year 
in addition  our credit agreement  as amended  provides that in each calendar year the outstanding amount under our working capital revolving credit facility must be equal to or less than million for a period of ten consecutive calendar days 
in addition to the obligations described in the above table  we have minimum volume purchase requirements at december  pricing is based on spot prices at the time of purchase 
please read note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to financial statements with respect to purchase commitments and sublease information related to certain lease agreements 
capital expenditures our terminalling operations require investments to expand  upgrade and enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operations regulations 
our capital requirements primarily consist of maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of  or sales generated by  existing assets and extend their useful lives  such as expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability  tankage and pipeline integrity and safety  and to address environmental regulations 
we had approximately million  million  million and million in maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended december  and and for the periods from january  through october  and from october  through december   respectively  which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated combined statements of cash flows 
repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
expansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets to grow our business and to expand existing facilities  such as projects that increase operating capacity by increasing tankage or adding terminals 
we generally fund our expansion capital expenditures through our acquisition and working capital revolving credit facilities or by raising additional equity 
we had approximately million and million in expansion capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  respectively  to increase our operating capacity and capabilities 
specifically  in may  we acquired three refined petroleum products terminals in albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont for cash consideration of approximately million plus million in acquisition costs  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in november  we acquired two refined petroleum products terminals in glenwood landing and inwood  new york for cash consideration of million plus million in acquisition costs  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  bringing the total for terminal acquisitions to million 
in addition  we had million in expenditures related to construction in process on our newly leased terminal in providence  rhode island and million in other expansion capital expenditures  which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated combined statements of cash flows  and partly include some investments we made in our information technology infrastructure to maintain uniformity among all our locations as we acquired assets 
for example  we are implementing an enterprise wide system that provides improved access to information about inventory  pricing and sales by location 
during  we acquired the bridgeport  connecticut facility for approximately million and the macungie  pennsylvania facility for approximately million  bringing the total for terminal acquisitions to million 
in addition  we had million in other expansion capital expenditures  which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated combined statements of cash flows  to increase our operating capacity and capabilities 
we did not incur expansion capital expenditures in the year ended december  we anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by operations 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquid assets  cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and the ability to issue additional common units and or debt securities under our shelf registration statement to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
cash flow in thousands successor predecessor consolidated consolidated combined october through december  january through october year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net cash used in provided by operating activities  net cash used in investment activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  combined results for the year ended december  is a non gaap financial measure and is presented here to provide additional information for comparing year over year information 
cash flow from operating activities generally reflects the purchasing patterns of inventory  the timing of collections on our accounts receivable  the seasonality of our business  fluctuations in refined petroleum product prices  our working capital requirements related to acquisitions and general market conditions 
net cash used in operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and primarily reflects the following i the million increase in net income offset by million representing the gain on the sale of our nymex holdings  inc shares and related nymex seats  ii changes of million in accounts receivable  million in inventories and million in prepaids and other assets  offset by changes of million in accounts payable and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  primarily the result of our acquisitions of refined petroleum products terminals in albany  newburgh  glenwood landing and inwood  new york and burlington  vermont in and in macungie  pennsylvania and bridgeport  connecticut in and the related supply and throughput contracts as well as increases in refined petroleum product prices year over year  and iii a million change in the fair value of our forward fixed price contracts 
for the year ended december   contracts supporting our forward fixed price hedge program required margin payments of approximately million to the mercantile exchange due to market direction while for the year december   similar hedging activity provided funds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  refined petroleum product prices  which have a significant impact on our cash flow  declined in compared to specifically  prices for gasoline  distillates and residual oil decreased  and  respectively 
as a result  we sold and purchased our products at reduced prices  which lowered our accounts receivable and accounts payable carrying values at december  our inventories balance increased by million at december  compared to december   due to product purchases for our newly acquired terminals in bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania and to expand our storage capacity at other locations 
in addition  we used approximately million in cash to fund the change in the fair value of our forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts 
theses changes were partially offset by the net income of million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  reflected the continued expansion of our balance sheet from increases in the carrying value of accounts receivable and inventories  which were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  as a result of continuing increases in product prices 
year end prices of home heating oil  which product accounted for the largest portion of our sales and inventories  as reflected on nymex increased by from december  to december  year end prices of residual oil as reflected in a leading industry publication increased by from december  to december  net cash used in investing activities increased by million for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and included a total of million in cash used to acquire the albany and newburgh  new york and burlington  vermont terminals million and the glenwood landing and inwood  new york terminals million  million in total capital expenditures which includes million related to construction in process on our newly leased terminal in providence  rhode island  and million in other total capital expenditures  offset by gross proceeds of million from the sale of our investment in nymex holdings  inc and related nymex seats 
net cash used in investing activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily attributable to million in cash used to acquire our bridgeport  connecticut and macungie  pennsylvania terminals  and million and million in cash used for expansion capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities represented maintenance capital expenditures of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and included net borrowings on our credit facilities of million  consisting of million in borrowings on our revolving line of credit and million in borrowings from our acquisition facility to fund the purchase of the albany  newburgh  glenwood landing and inwood  new york and burlington  vermont terminals  and net proceeds of million from the issuance of class b units  offset by million in cash distributions to our common and subordinated unitholders 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  we had borrowings of million from our revolving credit facility to finance business operations and paid cash distributions of million to our common and subordinated unitholders 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflected increased trade credit and borrowings under our then current revolving credit facility to finance our business activities  as well as the use of our revolving credit facility to finance business expansion and to assist global petroleum corp 
and other slifka family entities consistent with prior practices in the payment of their taxes on income derived from their ownership interests in our predecessor  global companies llc and affiliates 
credit agreement we  our general partner  our operating company and our operating subsidiaries have a four year senior secured credit agreement with total available commitments of million 
we repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements and  therefore  classify as a current liability the portion of the revolving line of credit we expect to pay down during the course of the year 
the long term portion of the revolving line of credit is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year 
the credit agreement will mature on april  there are three facilities under our credit agreement a working capital revolving credit facility to be used for working capital purposes and letters of credit in the principal amount equal to the lesser of our borrowing base and million  of which two million seasonal overline facilities are available each year only during the period between september and june  an million acquisition facility to be used for funding acquisitions similar to our business line that have a purchase price of million or less or million or less in the aggregate in any month period  and a million revolving credit facility to be used for general purposes  including payment of distributions to our unitholders 
in addition  provided no event of default as defined in the credit agreement then exists  we may request to increase the acquisition facility by up to another million  for a total acquisition facility of up to million  and the working capital revolving credit facility by up to another million  for a total working capital revolving credit facility of up to million 
any such request for an increase by us must be in a minimum amount of million  and no more than three such requests may be made for each facility 
borrowings under our working capital revolving credit  acquisition and revolving credit facilities bear interest at our option at the eurodollar rate  plus  and  respectively  the cost of funds rate  plus  and  respectively  or the bank s base rate 
the average interest rate for the year ended december  was 
we incur a letter of credit fee of per annum for each letter of credit issued 
in addition  we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the three facilities under the credit agreement including the unused portion of either of the seasonal overline facilities exercised by us at a rate of basis points per annum  a facility fee of basis points per annum on any unexercised seasonal overline facility during the period between september and june and a seasonal overline fee of  each time we elect to exercise either of the seasonal overline facilities 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
the total remaining availability for borrowings and letters of credit at december  was million 
as a result of an amendment dated october   the credit agreement provides that in each calendar year the outstanding amount under the working capital revolving credit facility must be equal to or less than million for a period of ten consecutive calendar days 
it is anticipated that the seasonal decrease in working capital as we exit our heating season will contribute to a decrease in borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement also imposes covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum working capital amounts  capital expenditure limits  a minimum ebitda ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
in the event of default under any of these covenants  we may seek a waiver or amendment of the covenants 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the capital expenditures limit for the year ended december  was million  and we exceeded this limit 
we sought and received from our lender a waiver to the capital expenditures limit covenant for the year ended december  we were in compliance with all other covenants at december  and expect to be in full compliance in the credit agreement limits distributions to our unitholders to available cash and permits borrowings to fund such distributions only under the million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is subject to an annual clean down period  requiring us to reduce the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility to for consecutive calendar days in each calendar year 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our operating company and operating subsidiaries 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and environmental matters our business of supplying refined petroleum products involves a number of activities that are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws 
for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our business  please read items and  business and properties environmental 
critical accounting policies and estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated combined financial statements is detailed in note of notes to financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis inventory we hedge substantially all of our inventory purchases through futures and swap agreements 
hedges are executed when inventory is purchased and are identified with that specific inventory 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized currently in earnings 
all hedged inventory is valued using the lower of cost  as determined by specific identification  or market 
prior to sale  hedges are removed from specific barrels of inventory  and the then unhedged inventory is sold and accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to our own inventory  we have exchange agreements with unrelated third party suppliers  whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and replace it at a later date 
similarly  these suppliers may draw inventory from us and replace it at a later date 
positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable 
negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable 
exchange transactions are valued using current quoted market prices 
leases we have a throughput agreement with global petroleum corp  one of our affiliates  with respect to its terminal in revere  massachusetts 
this agreement is accounted for as an operating lease 
please read item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence throughput agreement with global petroleum corp 
we also have entered into terminal and throughput lease arrangements with various unrelated oil terminals  certain of which arrangements have minimum usage requirements 
please read items and  business and properties storage 
we have future commitments  principally for office space and computer equipment  under the terms of operating lease arrangements  and we have lease income from office space leased to an unrelated third party at one of our terminals 
additionally  we have capital leases for other computer equipment 
our leases are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
revenue recognition sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products and natural gas and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery  net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of sale based on the estimated future outcome 
we also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale  which are included in cost of sales 
the amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers 
bad debt provisions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements  which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products of a desired quality or reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  any net differential for exchange agreements is recorded as an adjustment of inventory costs in the purchases component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are to be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
fair value hedges the fair value of our derivatives is determined through the use of independent markets and is based upon the prevailing market prices of such instruments at the date of valuation 
we enter into futures contracts for the receipt or delivery of refined petroleum products in future periods 
the contracts are entered into in the normal course of business to reduce risk of loss of inventory on hand  which could result through fluctuations in market prices 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized currently in earnings 
we also use futures contracts and swaps to hedge exposure under forward purchase and sale commitments 
these agreements are intended to hedge the cost component of virtually all of our forward commitments 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as offsetting gains or losses on the forward fixed price purchase and sale commitments  are recognized currently in earnings 
gains and losses on net product margin from forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts are reflected in earnings as these contracts mature 
we also market and sell natural gas 
we generally conduct business by entering into forward purchase commitments for natural gas only when we simultaneously enter into arrangements for the sale of product for physical delivery to third party users 
we generally take delivery under our purchase commitments at the same location as we deliver to third party users 
through these transactions  which establish an immediate margin  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between firm forward purchase and sales commitments 
natural gas is generally purchased and sold at fixed prices and quantities 
current price quotes from actively traded markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
interest rate hedge our zero premium interest rate collar is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the three month libor rate with respect to million of long term three month libor based borrowings 
under the collar  we capped our exposure at a maximum three month libor rate of 
in addition  we established a minimum floor rate of 
the collar  which expires on may   is designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the collar are recorded as either an asset or a liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
environmental and other liabilities we record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we are subject to other contingencies  including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  environmental matters  contract and employment claims 
environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses we previously owned 
further  due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations  there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements a description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and commodity risk 
we utilize one interest rate collar to manage exposure to interest rate risk and various derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity risk 
interest rate risk we utilize variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facility and term loan 
therefore  from time to time  we utilize interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific and anticipated debt issuances 
borrowings under our working capital revolving credit  acquisition credit and revolving credit facilities bear interest at our option at the eurodollar rate  plus  and  respectively  the cost of funds rate  plus  and  respectively  or the bank s base rate 
the average interest rate for the year ended december  was 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
the impact of a increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations  of approximately million annually  assuming  however  that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the year 
in  we executed a zero premium interest rate collar with a major financial institution 
the collar  which became effective on may   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the three month libor rate with respect to million of long term three month libor based borrowings 
under the contract  we capped our exposure at a maximum three month libor rate of 
in addition  we established a minimum floor three month libor rate of 
whenever the three month libor rate is greater than the cap  we receive from the financial institution the difference between the cap and the current three month libor rate on the million of long term three month libor based borrowings 
conversely  whenever the three month libor rate is lower than the floor  we remit to the financial institution the difference between the floor and the current three month libor rate on the million of long term three month libor based borrowings 
as of december   the three month libor rate of was within the cap and floor 
the collar  which expires on may   is designated as a cash flow hedge and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended 
commodity risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to refined petroleum products in storage and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the nymex and over the counter transactions  including swap contracts entered into with established financial institutions and other credit approved energy companies 
our policy is generally to purchase only products for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our profit 
while our policies are designed to minimize market risk  some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our product purchase activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of refined petroleum products 
we enter into futures contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchase and fixed forward sales of refined petroleum products 
any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations 
we utilize the nymex  which is a regulated exchange for energy products that it trades  thereby reducing potential delivery and supply risks 
generally  our practice is to close all nymex positions rather than to make or receive physical deliveries 
with respect to other energy products  we enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile  in order to hedge market fluctuations and or lock in margins relative to our commitments 
at december   the fair value of all of our commodity risk derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price increase are shown in the table below in thousands gain loss fair value at december  fair value after effect of price increase nymex contracts   swaps  options and other  net   the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at december  for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the spot market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
we have a daily margin requirement to maintain a cash deposit with our broker based on the prior day s market results on open futures contracts 
the balance of this deposit will fluctuate based on our open market positions and the commodity exchange s requirements 
the required brokerage margin balance was million at december  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties of forward contracts  options and swap agreements  but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 
futures contracts  the primary derivative instrument utilized  are traded on regulated exchanges  greatly reducing potential credit risks 
exposure on swap and certain option agreements is limited to the amount of the recorded fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
we utilize primarily one broker  a major financial institution  for all derivative transactions and the right of offset exists 
accordingly  the fair value of all derivative instruments is displayed on a net basis
