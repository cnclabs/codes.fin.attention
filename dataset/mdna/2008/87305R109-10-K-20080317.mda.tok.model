we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
ebitda is also a key component in two of our debt covenant calculations under our credit agreement the leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
however  the ebitda amount determined under our credit agreement is further adjusted to exclude certain transaction costs and other non cash charges see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the following provides a reconciliation of ebitda to the financial information in our consolidated statement of operations

we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit boards pcbs and backplane assemblies  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial and aerospace defense markets including the networking communications infrastructure  high end computing  defense  and industrial medical markets which are characterized by high levels of complexity and moderate production volumes 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing services ems providers  and aerospace defense companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
on october   we completed the acquisition of pcg from tyco international ltd 
the total purchase price of this acquisition was million  excluding acquisition costs 
this acquisition enhanced our business in the following ways positioned us as the largest pcb fabricator in north america as well as the largest pcb fabricator in the aerospace defense end market  expanded and diversified our customer base  added complementary commercial pcb fabrication facilities to our historic three commercial pcb manufacturing sites  added global backplane and sub system assembly capability  entered the backplane assembly market in china with a facility in shanghai  and expanded our engineering and materials expertise 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and approximately as of december  
table of contents sales to our largest customers accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively 
the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
year ended december  end markets networking communications aerospace defense computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
for pcbs we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders decreased from approximately of net pcb sales in to of net pcb sales in due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the inclusion of the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  and bad debt expense 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  the use of independent valuation firms and licensed environmental professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies for which significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  derivative instruments and hedging activities  realizability of deferred tax assets  establishing the fair value of individual assets acquired and individual liabilities assumed when we acquire other businesses  determining stock based compensation expense  self insured medical reserves  asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our acquisitions of other businesses 
during the fourth fiscal 
table of contents quarter  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and determined that no impairment existed 
at december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fas and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and current derivative financial instruments are limited to a single interest rate swap agreement 
when an interest rate swap derivative contract is executed  we designate the derivative instrument as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be paid cash flow hedge 
for its hedging relationship  we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged  how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed  and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivative that is used in hedging transactions is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with measurement at fair value 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of our interest rate swap is determined based on current market quotes for the underlying libor interest rate 
these values represent the estimated amount the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
the value of the actual difference between the market rate and the hedged rate applied to the notional value of the hedge is recorded to interest expense each period 
to the extent the interest rate swap provides an effective hedge  the differences between the fair value and the book value of the interest rate swap are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  as a component of stockholders equity 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have net deferred income tax assets of million and no valuation allowance 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if we reestablish a valuation allowance subsequent to december   and then determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets would be realizable in an amount greater than what already is recorded  we would reverse all or a portion of valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
business combinations we apply the provisions of purchase accounting when recording our acquisitions 
application of purchase accounting requires that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed of a business 
determination of the fair value of the assets involves a number of judgments and estimates 
in our acquisitions to date  we engaged an outside valuation firm to provide us with an appraisal report  which we utilized 
table of contents in determining the purchase price allocation 
the allocation of the purchase price to different asset classes impacts the depreciation and amortization expense we subsequently record 
the principal assets we have acquired to date are receivables  inventory  real estate  property and equipment  as well as intangible assets such as customer relationships 
the principal liabilities we have assumed to date are payables  asset retirement obligations and future environmental remediation obligations 
the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of tyco printed circuit group have been finalized as of december  share based awards effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted on and after january   and prior but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award using a straight line method 
prior to sfas no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore we generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with an exercise price below the market price on the date of grant 
we estimate the value of share based restricted stock unit awards on the date of grant using the closing share price 
we estimate the value of share based option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
calculating the fair value of share based option payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based payment awards and expected stock price volatility 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we have currently estimated our forfeiture rate to be percent 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
for the year ended december   share based compensation expense was million 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
at december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
self insurance we are self insured for group health insurance benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carrier for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carrier and broker on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to an aggregate stop loss that varies based on employee enrollment and factors that are established at each annual contract renewal 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
asset retirement obligation and environmental liabilities we establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dispose of or restore an asset upon its retirement and the timing and cost of such work is reasonably estimable 
we record such liabilities only when such timing and costs are reasonably determinable 
in addition  we accrue an 
table of contents estimate of the costs of environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions  and we discount these estimates at 
we may use outside environmental consultants to assist us in making these estimates 
we also are required to estimate the amount of any probable recoveries  including insurance recoveries 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship to net sales of various items in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income  net income before income taxes income tax provisions benefit net income the year ended december  includes a full year of results of operations from pcg facilities compared to only days for the year ended december  as the acquisition occurred on october  the acquisition has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our operations as discussed in the various comparisons noted below 
the company has two reportable segments pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly 
prior to our acquisition of pcg we had one reportable segment 
these reportable segments are managed separately because they distribute and manufacture distinct products with different production processes 
pcb manufacturing fabricates printed circuit boards 
backplane assembly is a contract manufacturing business that specializes in assembling backplanes into subassemblies and other complete electronic devices 
pcb manufacturing customers are either ems companies or oem companies  while backplane assembly customers are usually oems 
our backplane assembly segment includes our hayward  california and shanghai  china plants and our ireland sales and distribution infrastructure 
our pcb manufacturing segment is composed of nine domestic pcb fabrication plants  of which one was closed during the second quarter  and a facility which provides follow on value added 
table of contents services primarily for one of the pcb manufacturing plants 
the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales pcb manufacturing backplane assembly total sales inter company sales total net sales net sales net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to several factors  including the addition of a full year of results from the acquired pcg facilities  and higher pricing 
the increase in net sales reflects an increase of million from our pcg facilities  an increase of million from our historical operations  offset by a million increase in inter company sales 
the backplane assembly segment accounted for million of this net sales increase  and the pcg printed circuit board operations accounted for the remaining million 
printed circuit board volume increased approximately due to the full year inclusion of the pcg operations 
pricing increased approximately primarily due to a full year of results from the pcg facilities  which tend to have higher average pricing 
the increase in pricing was driven equally by increases in quick turn and standard product pricing 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  decreased from of pcb revenue in to of pcb revenue in due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the full year inclusion of results from the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to several factors  including the addition of the pcg facilities  and both increased prices and production volume at the three historical ttm technologies plants 
of the million increase in net sales  million resulted from our pcg acquisition  including million from the backplane assembly segment 
volume increased approximately primarily due to higher demand from our customers for our products 
prices rose approximately due to increased demand for pcbs as well as a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  decreased from of pcb revenue in to of pcb revenue in due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the inclusion of the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to several factors  including the addition of a full year of results for the pcg facilities  especially from the backplane assembly operations  which have inherently higher cost content and lower margins 
likewise  higher material prices contributed to the increase in cost of goods sold from to cost of goods sold in included million of manufacturing profit added to pcg inventories at the acquisition date  that was expensed during a similar adjustment increased cost of goods sold for by million 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for to for cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to several factors  including the addition of the pcg facilities  and both increased material prices and production volume at the three historic ttm technologies plants 
adding to this increase in cost of goods sold was higher repair and maintenance costs  higher utilities costs  and higher depreciation expense 
the increase in cost of goods sold included approximately million for the value of the manufacturing profit added to the pcg inventories at the acquisition date 
in addition  higher wage rates  greater headcount  increased incentive 
table of contents compensation  and the inclusion of stock option expense led to increased labor costs 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for primarily due to increased pricing and greater absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
gross profit as a result of the foregoing regarding cost of goods sold  gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in our gross margin was largely due to inclusion of a full year of results from our backplane assembly operations  which have inherently lower gross margins 
additionally  slightly lower volume at our pcb manufacturing operations reduced absorption of fixed costs at some of our plants further reducing gross margin 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases 
however  at higher capacity utilization rates  additional employees and capital may be required 
for the year ended december   gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin increased from in to in the increase in our gross margin was due to higher sale prices for our products as well as lower cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales  which increased due to the factors discussed above  partially offset by backplane assembly sales  which have inherently lower gross margins 
this increase in gross margin was fueled by increased absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for  due to inclusion of a full year of results of the pcg facilities in as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased slightly from in to in the components of selling and marketing expenses as a percent of net sales did not change significantly from to selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for  primarily due to the inclusion of the pcg facilities in our results for as well as higher commission expense due to higher revenue 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased from in to in due to greater absorption of fixed costs 
the mix of selling and marketing expenses did not change significantly from to general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from the inclusion of the pcg facilities in our results for the full year of other factors that increased general and administrative expense were higher stock based compensation expense from a greater number of employees participating in our equity award program as well as increased accounting  legal and consulting expenses related to integration of the acquisition as well as bringing the newly acquired pcg facilities into sarbanes oxley compliance during general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to greater absorption of these costs over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from the inclusion of the pcg facilities in our results for other factors that increased general and administrative expense were higher incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense as well as increased accounting  legal fees and consulting expenses related to completion and integration of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to greater absorption of these costs over a larger revenue base 

table of contents amortization of definite lived intangibles amortization expense related to definite lived intangibles increased million to million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in similarly  amortization expense related to definite lived intangibles increased million to million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in amortization expense for both and is primarily due to the increase in strategic customer relationship intangibles related to the pcg acquisition in october restructuring charges in the fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to realigning certain sales and administrative functions 
other income expense other income expense declined million from income of million in to expense of million in this net decrease resulted from an increase of million in interest expense and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to our million senior secured term loan used to fund the acquisition of pcg  and a decrease of million in interest income primarily from interest earned on lower balances of cash and cash equivalents 
other income expense declined million from income of million in to income of million in this net decrease resulted from an increase of million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs due to early repayment of outstanding principle balance of our million senior secured term loan used to fund the acquisition of pcg  net of an increase of million from interest earned on higher balances in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments for most of income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from million for to million for the decrease in income tax provision from to resulted from the release of the valuation allowance of million to reflect the our ability to utilize state tax credit carryforwards  lower pretax income in  and a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax rate was in and our effective tax rate is in excluding the favorable impacts to our tax provision resulting from the decreases in our valuation allowance in  our effective tax rate in was 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
the provision for income taxes increased from a million benefit for to a million provision for the change from an income tax benefit in to an income tax provision in resulted from a favorable valuation allowance adjustment in  higher pretax income in  and a higher effective tax rate for our effective tax benefit rate was in  and our effective tax provision rate was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
during  reversal of approximately million of valuation allowance slightly impacted our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  and proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance acquisitions  meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  and fund working capital requirements 
we anticipate that servicing debt  funding working capital requirements  and financing capital expenditures will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
on october   we completed the pcg acquisition for million  excluding acquisition costs 
this purchase price was paid using some of our available cash and cash equivalents as well as proceeds from our million senior secured term loan 
additionally  we supplemented the senior secured term loan with a million senior secured revolving credit facility 

table of contents as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to a reduction in cash and short term investments which was used to reduce our overall debt outstanding 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in our operating cash flow of million  which significantly benefited from the acquisition of pcg  primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  a decrease in net deferred income tax assets of million  and a net decrease in working capital of million 
our operating cash flow of million as compared to primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  a decrease in deferred income tax assets of million  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million  excluding cash and short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  we acquired the pcg business and used cash of million  which is net of the cash acquired and includes the direct acquisition costs 
in  we made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment  offset by proceeds of million from the redemption of short term investments 
in  we made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment  offset by a reduction of million in our net short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million in and million in our financing net cash used reflects repayments of million of debt  partially offset by proceeds of million from employee stock option exercises and million from other factors 
our financing net cash flow reflects proceeds of million from issuance of debt  approximately million from employee stock option exercises and million from a variety of other factors  partially offset by payment of million of debt issuance costs for our senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of long term debt obligations outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility and no borrowing outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
beginning with our adoption of sfas r on january   the excess of tax benefits upon exercise of common stock options is reported as a cash flow from financing activities 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million and will fund capital equipment purchases to increase capacity and expand our technological capabilities throughout our facilities 
in connection with the pcg acquisition  the company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation at two connecticut sites and is obligated to investigate a third connecticut site 
the company currently estimates that it will incur remediation costs of million to million over the next to months related to these matters 
in addition  the company has obligations to the connecticut department of environmental protection to make certain environmental asset improvements to the waste water treatment systems in two connecticut plants 
these costs are estimated to be million and have been considered in the company s capital expenditures plan for lastly  we are required to maintain a compliance management plan through july under a compliance agreement with the us environmental protection plan  assumed from tyco 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with certain lenders led by ubs securities llc 
the credit agreement consists of a million senior secured term loan  which matures in october and a million senior secured revolving loan facility  which matures in october the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets and of foreign assets 
the senior secured revolving loan facility also contains a million letter of credit sub facility 
the credit agreement is rated bb by standard and poors and b by moodys 
borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at a floating rate of either a base rate the alternate base rate plus an applicable interest margin or libor plus an applicable interest margin 
the alternate base rate is equal to the greater of i the federal funds rate plus or ii the prime rate 
borrowings under the credit agreement  at our option  will initially bear interest at a rate based on either a the alternate base rate plus or b libor plus 
for the senior secured revolving loan facility  the applicable interest margins on both alternate base rate and 
table of contents libor may decrease by up to if our total leverage ratio decreases as defined under the terms of the credit agreement 
there is no provision  other than an event of default  for these interest margins to increase 
at december  and the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was and  respectively 
each calendar year we are required to repay of the outstanding senior secured term loan balance  subject to specific adjustments  as defined in the credit agreement 
we do not have a contractual maturity payment due in  however we expect to repay million during the next fiscal year 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  limitations on dividends  stock repurchases  and stock redemptions in addition to maintaining maximum total leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios 
we are in compliance with these covenants at december  we are also required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the senior revolving loan facility 
as of december   million of the standby letter of credit was outstanding 
available borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving loan facility was million at december  based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our five year senior secured million revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated debt service  capital expenditure  and working capital needs for the next months and beyond

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuation in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on debt 

table of contents on january   we entered into a three year pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap applied a fixed interest rate against the first interest payments of the portion of the million six year term senior loan arrangement 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap amortizes to zero over its term  consistent with our planned debt pay down and the credit agreement s requirement of maintaining interest rate protection on at least of term senior loan debt for a minimum of three years 
the notional value underlying the hedge at december  was million 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  we pay a fixed rate of and receive floating month libor which was at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap as of december   was a liability of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  of which million is effectively fixed by our three year pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swap 
if interest rates on the remaining million variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt at december  foreign currency exchange risk

our chinese operations utilize the chinese yuan or rmb as the functional currency  which results in the company recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within our statement of stockholders equity 
net foreign currency transaction gains or losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were million gain and million loss during the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively 
there were no foreign currency transaction gains or losses for the year ended december  we currently do not utilize any derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risks
