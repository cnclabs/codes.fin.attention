quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
in recent years  the bank has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk i emphasizing the origination and retention of residential monthly and bi weekly adjustable rate mortgage loans  commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans  other business purpose loans and consumer loans consisting primarily of auto loans  ii selling substantially all newly originated longer term fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans into the secondary market without recourse and on a servicing retained basis  and iii managing the bank s investment activities in a prudent manner in the context of overall balance sheet asset liability management 
investing in shorter term securities will generally bear lower yields as compared to longer term investments  but will better position the bank for increases in market interest rates and better matches the maturities of the bank s certificate of deposit accounts 
certificates of deposit that mature in one year or less  at december  totaled million  or of total interest bearing liabilities 
borrowed funds that mature in one year or less  at december  totaled million  or of total interest bearing liabilities 
management believes that this balanced approach to investing will reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations will enhance long term profitability 
net income and portfolio value analysis 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a net income model and a net portfolio value npv model which generates estimates of the change in the bank s net income and npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates and reinvestment rates 
the following sets forth the bank s net income and npv as of december  caption change in net interest income net portfolio value interest rates in basis points dollars dollar percent dollars dollar percent rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands

the bank s npv trend declined slightly in all rate scenarios from to as the discount on core deposits declined more than the premium increased on earning assets 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in net interest income and npv requires the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net interest income and table assumes that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results
