item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview oculus innovative sciences is a biopharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and markets a family of products  based on its platform technology called microcyn  intended to help prevent and treat infections in chronic and acute wounds 
microcyn is a non irritating oxychlorine compound designed to treat a wide range of pathogens  including antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria  viruses  fungi and spores 
financial operations overview revenues we derive our revenues from product sales and service arrangements 
product revenues are generated from the sale of microcyn products to hospitals  medical centers  doctors  pharmacies  distributors and strategic partners  and are generally recorded upon shipment following receipt of a purchase order or upon obtaining proof of sell through by a distributor 
product sales are made either through direct sales personnel or distributors 
service revenues are derived from consulting and testing contracts 
service revenues are generally recorded upon performance under the service contract 
revenues generated from testing contracts are recorded upon completion of the test and when the final report is sent to the customer 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues represents the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products  including expenses for our various facilities which are fixed  and related personnel cost and the cost of materials used to produce our products 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of personnel related expenses and supplies 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of costs related to the research and development of microcyn  new products and new delivery systems for our products  and to carry out preclinical studies and clinical trials to obtain various regulatory approvals 
research and development expense is charged to operations as incurred 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs  including salaries and sales commissions  and education and promotional expenses associated with microcyn and costs related to administrative personnel and senior management 
these expenses also include the costs of educating physicians and other healthcare professionals regarding our products and participating in industry conferences and seminars 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes travel costs  outside consulting services  legal and accounting fees and other professional and administrative costs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to exercise its judgment 
we exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting polices and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  our recognition of revenues and expenses  and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
areas in which we exercise significant judgment include  but are not necessarily limited to  our valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  equity transactions compensatory and financing and contingencies 
we have also adopted certain polices with respect to our recognition of revenue that we believe are consistent with the guidance provided under securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience  knowledge of our business and industry  current and expected economic conditions  the attributes of our products  regulatory environment  and in certain cases  the results of outside appraisals 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary 
while we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies  we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate 
since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results could differ from such estimates 
a description of significant accounting polices that require us to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is as follows stock based compensation prior to april   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations and applied the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
we used the minimum value method to measure the fair value of awards issued prior to april  with respect to our application of the disclosure requirements under sfas no 
effective april   we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r using the prospective method 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
under sfas r  sbp awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will result in a charge to operations 
we had a choice of two attribution methods for allocating compensation costs under sfas r the straight line method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of an award  or the graded vesting attribution method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award 
table of contents was  in substance  multiple awards 
we chose the former method and amortized the fair value of each option on a straight line basis over the requisite period of the last separately vesting portion of each award 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we generate product revenues from sales of our products to hospitals  medical centers  doctors  pharmacies  distributors and strategic partners 
we sell our products directly to third parties and to distributors through various cancelable distribution agreements 
we have also entered into an agreement to license our products 
we apply the revenue recognition principles set forth in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition  with respect to all of our revenues 
accordingly  we record revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the sale is reasonable assured 
we require all of our product sales to be supported by evidence of a sale transaction that clearly indicates the selling price to the customer  shipping terms and payment terms 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order approved by the customer 
we have ongoing relationships with certain customers from which we customarily accept orders by telephone in lieu of a purchase order 
we recognize revenues at the time in which we receive a confirmation that the goods were either tendered at their destination when shipped fob destination  or transferred to a shipping agent when shipped fob shipping point 
delivery to the customer is deemed to have occurred when the customer takes title to the product 
generally  title passes to the customer upon shipment  but could occur when the customer receives the product based on the terms of the agreement with the customer 
while we have a policy of investigating the creditworthiness of our customers  we have  under certain circumstances  shipped goods in the past and deferred the recognition of revenues when available information indicates that collection is in doubt 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts when available information causes us to believe that a credit loss is probable 
we market a substantial portion of our goods through distributors 
in europe  we defer recognition of distributor generated revenues until the time we confirm that distributors have sold these goods 
although our terms provide for no right of return  our products have a finite shelf life and we may  at our discretion  accommodate distributors by accepting returns to avoid the distribution of expired goods 
service revenues are recorded upon performance of the service contracts 
revenues generated from testing contracts are recorded when the test is completed and the final report is sent to the customer 
inventory and cost of revenues we state our inventory at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market  based on standard costs 
establishing standard manufacturing costs requires us to make estimates and assumptions as to the quantities and costs of materials  labor and overhead that are required to produce a finished good 
cost of service revenues is expensed when incurred 
income taxes we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense or loss based upon tax statutes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in making these estimates  we adjust our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences in loss and credit carryforwards that will reverse in subsequent years 
we also establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based  in part  on predictions that management must make as to our results in future periods 
the outcome of events could differ over time which would require that we make changes in our valuation allowance 

table of contents comparison of years ended march  and overview our strategy this past year was first and foremost to focus on the clinical program in the united states  the largest addressable market in the world for microcyn 
last year we made a strategic decision to focus our resources on the us clinical process and to dramatically reduce international expenses 
we achieved both objectives by completing the phase ii trial with good results and reducing our international expenses by million  compared to last year 
the emphasis in mexico was to break even  which occurred in the last month of the fiscal year  with a reduction in operating expenses of million on a full year basis 
revenues our total revenues were million for the year ended march   a decline from the prior year level of million 
the  or  decline in product revenues was primarily due to  or  lower sales to our customer alkem laboratories limited  in india  and a  or  decline in mexico sales 
alkem is responsible for bottling  labeling  shipping and selling their microcyn product called oxum through their own sales force in india 
sales to alkem in the prior year were driven by large initial stocking orders of samples used during their initial product launch 
although the large initial stocking orders did not recur in the year ended march   alkem continues to sell and ship product to doctors and patients in india in steadily growing volumes 
sales in mexico have also declined  over the prior year  a result of the reduction in our sales force in mexico as we executed our strategy of lowering expenses in our international subsidiaries and focusing our resources on us clinical and development initiatives 
more specifically  with the reduction of the sales force in mexico from to people  we have focused on the growth of sales to pharmacies and not sales to hospitals due to the higher profitability and higher sales price attainable from pharmacies 
consequently  the decline in hospital sales was partially offset by growth in sales to pharmacies compared to the prior year 
the following table shows our product revenues by country note that sales in india are reported as part of our european operating segment year ended march  in thousands us mexico india europe total the  or  increase in service revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of tests performed by our services business 
gross profit loss we reported gross profit from our products business of million  or of product revenues  during the fiscal year ended march   compared to a gross profit of million  or  in the year ago period 
this decrease is due primarily to the lower sales volumes in india  and the relatively high fixed cost component in our european facility where this product is produced 
margins in mexico have also decreased from year to year due to lower sales volumns  and a slight increase in the cost of production in the current year 
we reported losses from our services business of  for the year ended march   compared to a  loss in the prior year 
we expect gross profits to increase as a percentage of sales in future periods as we grow our microcyn based products business 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march   from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of million higher clinical development costs from  during the year ended march  to million during the year ended march  these clinical development costs included  and million in contract research organization fees related to our phase ii clinical trials in the years ended march  and respectively 
in addition  our other research and development expenses increased as we grew the product development team  expanded the scope of our new product development initiatives  and continued to enhance our cgmp manufacturing capabilities at our us research and development facility 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we incur the costs associated with clinical trials and as we continue to expand our new product development programs 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march   from million for the year ended march  primarily this decrease was due to million lower selling  general and administrative expenses in our europe and mexico subsidiaries as we executed our strategy of shifting our company resources away from expanding markets internationally through a reduction in force in these subsidiaries 
this decrease was offset in part by a million increase in our us selling  general  and administrative expenses  primarily the result higher outside service expenses as compared to the year ago period 
outside service expenses were million higher than the prior year  primarily due to  higher legal fees as oculus has relied more on outside counsel for both public company related sec filings and ip protection work   higher accounting fees  and  higher fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance and other finance projects 
bonus expense also increased  to  during the year ended march   as the compensation plans for executives and employees were increased to more closely correspond to market levels 
insurance expense also increased  over the prior year due to the new directors and officers liability insurance initiated following our ipo in january these increases were offset in part by  lower travel expense as the executive team was not required to travel to mexico and europe as often as they had in the prior year  and  lower stock compensation expense 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will stay relatively constant in future periods 
we are  however  currently assessing strategies for initiating a sales and marketing launch in the united states of our dermacyn wound care product using current or additional k claims that  if initiated  will lead to higher sales and marketing expenses as early as the year ending march  interest income and expense and other income and expense interest expense increased  to million for the year ended march   from  in the year ago period  primarily due to higher average debt balance during the year ended march  as compared to the year ago period 
interest income increased  to  for the year ended march   from  in the year ago period  primarily due to higher interest bearing investments in the current year 
other income and expense primarily consists of non cash charges due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates  and the resulting gain or loss booked for the revaluation of our intercompany notes payable denominated in non local currencies 
during the year ended march   the us dollar became weaker in relation to the mexican peso and the euro  and a net  gain on foreign exchange was recorded accordingly 
during the year ended march   the us dollar became weaker in relation to the mexican peso and the euro  and a  gain on foreign exchange was recorded 
we expect that interest expense will decrease in future periods as we continue to pay down our current debt balance  and interest income will fluctuate in proportion to our interest bearing investments 

table of contents comparison of years ended march  and revenues we experienced growth in revenues in both our product and services businesses resulting in reported revenues of million in the year ended march   an increase of from the prior year level of million 
the million  or  increase in product revenues was due primarily to higher sales volumes in mexico and europe  and sales to a new customer  alkem laboratories limited  in india 
the following table shows our product revenues by country note that sales to india are reported as part of our european operating segment year ended march  in thousands u 
s mexico india europe total the  or  increase in service revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of tests performed by our services business 
gross profit loss we reported gross profit from our microcyn products business of million  or of product revenues  in the year ended march   compared to the prior year reported gross loss of million  or of product revenues 
the gross loss in the year ended march  was adversely affected by million of non recurring inventory write downs and approximately  of non recurring charges associated with the relocation of our mexico manufacturing facility during the year 
excluding these charges  our gross loss from product sales in the year ended march  would have been  or of product revenues 
the increase in product gross margin  excluding these non recurring charges  from in the year ended march   to in the year ended march   was primarily due to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies through the consolidation of our worldwide manufacturing from three sites to two during the year 
in april  we transitioned the united states facility from a product manufacturing site into a research and development facility  and began producing all products for sales outside of mexico in our facility in europe 
the remaining improvements in gross profits were due to a full year of benefit from the relocation of our mexican manufacturing site during the year ended march  from morelia  mexico into a lower cost manufacturing facility in zapopan  mexico 
we reported a gross loss from our services business of  or of service revenues  in the year ended march   compared to the prior year reported gross loss of  or of service revenues 
this improvement in margin from to was due primarily to the growth in sales volume of our services which moved our service revenues closer to exceeding the relatively high fixed cost of our laboratory facility 
additionally  we discontinued our consulting service business during the year ended march  which had a positive impact on our services margin 
research and development expense research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march   from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of higher personnel costs associated with the expansion of our research and development teams 
the expansion of these teams was through both an internal shift in our us operations from product manufacturing to research and development  as well as through the hiring of outside personnel 
the expansion of the research and development teams helps support our increased attention to product development and the management of regulatory trials designed to obtain fda drug approvals for our microcyn products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased  or  to million for the year ended march   from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in non cash stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended march  this increase in stock compensation charges was primarily the result of charges incurred for the options issued to a new board member  which are amortized over the two year agreement  and for the warrants issued for the settlement of litigation with a past employee 
this increase was offset in the current year by lower outside service expenses  primarily in legal and accounting fees 
interest income and expense and other income and expense interest expense increased  to  for the year ended march   from  in the year ended march   primarily due to the issuance of million of new debt during the year 
the new debt had amortized debt issuance costs booked as non cash interest of  and normal interest expense of  during the year ended march  other income and expense primarily consists of non cash charges due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates  and the resulting gain or loss booked for the revaluation of our intercompany notes payable denominated in non local currencies 
during the year ended march   the us dollar became weaker in relation to the mexican peso and the euro  and a net  gain on foreign exchange was recorded accordingly 
in comparison  during the year ended march   the us dollar became stronger in relation to the mexican peso and the euro  and a  loss on foreign exchange was recorded 
additionally  during the year ended march   we incurred  in loss on the disposal of assets 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not yet achieved profitability  and we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability in the future 
sources of liquidity since our inception  substantially all of our operations have been financed through the sale of million of our common and convertible preferred stock 
these net proceeds include million raised in our initial public offering in january  and net proceeds of million raised from the sale of common stock sold during the year ended march  in offerings described further below 
we have received additional funding through various debt and financing transactions  as described further below 
we have also used our revenues to date as a source of additional liquidity 
as of march   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow a maximum of million 
under this facility we borrowed million  and paid back million in principal as of march  the terms of this facility include monthly principal payments over three years  plus interest payments of per annum 
pursuant to provisions of the loan and security agreement  we no longer have the ability to borrow under this facility 
on november   we signed a loan agreement with robert burlingame  under which mr 
burlingame advanced to us million  which funded on november   accruing interest at an annual rate of 
the principal and all accrued interest under the loan agreement were to be paid promptly after the closure of a private placement of securities  such as our private placement in august in august  we paid all principal and outstanding interest under this loan agreement from cash  including million of restricted cash 
on august   we closed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million after deducting the placement agent s commission and other offering expenses 
the exercise price for the warrants was adjusted to 
table of contents in march  after the anti dilution provisions of the warrants were triggered by our registered direct offering 
the investor warrants are now exercisable for an additional  shares 
on february   we filed a shelf registration statement  which was declared effective on february  in connection with this s  we may  from time to time  offer and sell preferred stock  either separately or represented by depositary shares  common stock or warrants  either separately or in units  in one or more offerings 
the preferred stock and warrants may be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common

on april   there was a second closing of the same offering of  shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for gross proceeds of  cash flows as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at march  and million at march  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended march  was million  primarily due to the million net loss for the period 
this use of cash was offset in part by a million increase in accrued expenses  due primarily to the discretionary bonus amounts accrued during the year  and other non cash charges  including million of stock based compensation   of depreciation and amortization and  of non cash interest expense  and to a lesser extent the  decrease in accounts receivable  resulting primarily from improved collections from customers in our mexico subsidiary 
net cash used during the year ended march  was million  primarily due to the million net loss for the period and to a lesser extent due to a  decrease in accrued liabilities due to the payment on accrued clinical expenses related to our phase ii trial on treatment of diabetic foot ulcers  a  increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments made from our customers  and a  decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made to our vendors 
these uses of cash during the year ended march  were offset in part by non cash charges of million of stock based compensation   of depreciation and  of non cash interest expense 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended march  was million  primarily due to the million net loss for the period  and to a lesser extent the  increase in accounts receivables due to slow collections from customers of our mexico subsidiary  and an  increase in our prepaid expenses 
these uses of cash were offset in part by a million increase in accounts payable as several large accounts for legal and accounting expenses were outstanding at the fiscal year end  and non cash charges including  of depreciation and amortization  and  of stock based compensation 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
primarily this cash was used during the year ended march  for upgrading our us research and clinical facility to cgmp compliance  the purchase of equipment to support increased personnel in our united states facility  and to buy laboratory equipment to further our research and development capacities 
in the years ended march  and  net cash for investing activities were used primarily for investment in fixed assets and other capital expenditures to support increased personnel and manufacturing facility expansion in europe and mexico 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended march  was primarily related to the sale of common stock of million during the year ended march  consisting of million net cash raised in a private placement in august  and the million net cash 
table of contents raised in a registered direct offering in march the net amounts received from financing were decreased by million in restricted cash released for the repayment of the million loan from bob burlingame 
these cash increases were offset in part by million in debt payments including the entire repayment of the loan from bob burlingame 
the net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended march  was primarily related to our initial public offering which raised net cash of million in january  and to a lesser extent the million in proceeds from the issuance of debt during the year  including burlingame note and million in debt from a financial institution  and million of net proceeds raised from our series c sale of convertible preferred stock 
these cash additions were offset in part by million of cash restricted for the payment of the bob burlingame loan  and million of principal payments made on outstanding debt 
the net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended march  was primarily related to million of net proceeds raised from our series b sale of convertible preferred stock  offset in part by  of principal payments made on outstanding debt 
contractual obligations as of march   we had contractual obligations as follows long term debt and capital lease amounts include principal payments only payments due by period less than total year years years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases total we currently lease approximately  square feet of office  research and manufacturing space in petaluma  california  which serves as our principal executive offices 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in an adjacent building for research and development under the lease agreement 
the lease was scheduled to expire on september  on september   we entered into amendment no 
to the property lease agreement for our facility in petaluma  california 
the amendment extends the lease expiration date to september  we lease approximately  square feet of office and manufacturing space and approximately  square feet of warehouse space in zapopan  mexico  under a lease that expires in april and we lease approximately  square feet of office space and approximately  square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space in sittard  the netherlands  under a lease that was scheduled to expire on january  on february   we extended this lease to january as we expand  we may need to establish manufacturing facilities in other countries 
we believe that our properties will be adequate to meet our needs through march we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in rules promulgated by the sec 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future as we continue our fda clinical trials on our microcyn technology to treat diabetic foot ulcers  and the subsequent commercialization of an fda approved drug 
we can not assure that such approvals will be obtained  but if we do obtain them  it will take at least several years to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize microcyn as a drug in the united states 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents together with our future revenues and interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements to continue our sales and marketing and some research and development activities through march however  in order to fund the pivotal clinical trials  execute our product development strategy  and to commercialize microcyn as a drug product in the united states  we anticipate a need to raise additional funds prior 
table of contents to march   and in periods following  through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our stockholders 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
a failure to secure additional funding when needed may require us to curtail certain operational activities  including regulatory trials  sales and marketing  and international operations and would have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial condition 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions include reserves and write downs related to receivables and inventories  the recoverability of long term assets  deferred taxes and related valuation allowances and valuation of equity instruments

 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas achieves these improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format 
it also provides more information about an entity s liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk related 
finally  it requires cross referencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments

other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to interest rate risk is confined to our excess cash in highly liquid money market funds denominated in us dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
foreign currency market risks we have two significant subsidiaries  one each in europe and mexico 
revenues and expenses associated with these subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currency 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and these foreign currencies 
in order to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  we maintain minimal cash balances in the foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are successful in our efforts to grow internationally  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  primarily the euro and mexican peso  may increase 

table of contents we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to the euro denominated and us dollar denominated intercompany receivables 
because our intercompany receivables are accounted for in euros and us dollars  any appreciation of the euro or mexican peso will result in a gain or loss to the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our currency exposure merits  we may consider entering into transactions to help mitigate the risk
