additionally  in december  our uk subsidiary  costar limited  acquired grecam sas grecam  a provider of commercial property information and market level surveys  studies and consulting services located in paris  france 
in february  costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited propex  a provider of commercial property information and operator of an online investment property exchange located in london  england 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading recent acquisitions 
in  we began our expansion into new metropolitan markets throughout the us  as well as expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and us markets 
in the first quarter of  our expansion into the new markets was complete 
in early  we announced the launch of a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information 
the new retail component of our flagship product  costar property professional  was unveiled in may at the international council of shopping centers convention in las vegas 
during the second half of  we began actively researching commercial properties in new core based statistical areas cbsas in the us  increased our us field research fleet by adding vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles 
in march  we signed a long term lease for a new research facility in white marsh  maryland  in support of our expanded research efforts and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel 
we released our costar property professional service in the new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of in an effort to further expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings  including our retail service 
we believe that there is opportunity to capture potential revenue from prospective customers for our service in our current markets 
we have restructured and expanded our field sales force in the us to take advantage of this market opportunity 
in the fourth quarter of  we began rapidly expanding the size of our sales force and have since doubled its size 
sales representatives with less than a year of experience tend to be less productive than representatives with more than a year of experience 
we expect that productivity per sales person will increase over the next year 
in connection with our recent acquisitions of propex and grecam  we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk  integrate our international operations more fully with those of the us  and eventually to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 
we recently introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations 
to cost effectively manage the growth of our international operations  we opened a research operations center in glasgow  scotland in  rather than expand our operations in london 
during the third quarter of  we took steps to consolidate and streamline our international operations 
as a result of these steps  certain management and staff positions in the uk were made redundant  which reduced certain costs and the amount of office space required in london 
on september   costar uk limited  a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar  entered into an agreement to assign the leasehold for our london office in mayfair 
effective december   costar uk limited assigned its lease interest in that office space in exchange for a payment of million  net of expenses 
we consolidated our london offices in mayfair and sheen into one facility in central london 
we expect to gain operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 
our expansion into new cbsas  expansion of our coverage in existing markets  sales force expansion and expansion and integration of our international operations has caused our costs in to escalate over costs in however  as we complete these initiatives and the related costs stabilize  we believe they will facilitate the generation of additional revenue and provide a platform for earnings growth 
our results reflect growth in earnings as a result of these investments in our business  and we expect revenues to continue to grow over what is now a relatively fixed cost base for our us research operations 
although we do not currently plan to initiate new significant investments through  we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services within our current platform  consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization 
any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings in to remain profitable  driving overall earnings growth throughout and providing substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
we expect revenue to grow over revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform  successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base  continued depth of coverage and acquisitions 
we expect that ebitda  which is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  will increase over based on the growth in ebitda from us operations 
we anticipate that our ebitda for our existing core us platform will continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue 
we believe the company is well positioned to generate continued  sustained earnings through the end of we currently issue restricted stock and stock options to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we plan to continue the use of alternative stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
we incurred approximately million in total equity compensation expense in our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  focus services and propex services currently generate approximately of our total revenues 
our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  our contract renewal rate was over 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by the company relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by operating segment on october st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which we expect to use during as a result  we expect cash payments for taxes during of approximately million because our us taxable income will no longer be absorbed by carryforward losses 
our uk operations are expected to generate net operating losses for the full year losses in the uk  will generate a lower tax benefit than if the costs were incurred in the us  thereby creating a higher effective tax rate in non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

income tax expense  net increased to million in  from million in this increase was due to higher income before income taxes for  partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was lower in due to the gain on lease settlement in the uk that was completed in december the lease settlement resulted in income in the uk  which reduced the overall effective tax rate 
comparison of business segment results for year ended december  and year ended december  due to the increased size  complexity and funding requirements associated with our international expansion  in we began to manage our business geographically in two operating segments  with our primary areas of measurement and decision making being the us and international  which includes the uk and france 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment ebitda  which is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business 
however  this measure should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
segment revenues

accounting treatment 
these acquisitions were accounted for using purchase accounting 
the purchase price for each acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired database technology  customer base  trade names  and goodwill 
the acquired database technology is being amortized on a straight line basis over four years 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over ten years 
the grecam and propex acquired trade names are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of grecam and propex have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for either acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased principally as a result of ebitda  interest income  and proceeds from exercise of stock options  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets  cash used for the purchase of propex for approximately million  capital expenditures and changes in working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increased earnings before non cash charges for taxes  stock based compensation  provision for losses on accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization  and the million net gain from lease settlement  partially offset by the net effect of changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to the acquisition of propex for approximately million  net of acquired cash  increased purchases of short term investments and increased purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the higher net cash produced by financing activities in compared to is due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total and thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations amounts do not include current purchase obligations that may be renewed on the same or different terms or terminated by us or a third party 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million  including expenditures related to our expansion  support for our existing operations as well as building photography 
we expect to make capital expenditures in of approximately million to million  including investments in facilities  building photography  network equipment and workstations to support ongoing operations 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of february   we had million of short term investments in studen loan auction rate securities and million of these securities failed to settle at auctions 
these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments  the investments are not liquid in the short term 
in the event we need to immediately access these funds  we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which we expect to use during as a result  we expect our cash payments for taxes to be approximately million during because our us taxable income will no longer be absorbed by carryforward losses 
inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and abroad 
in general  we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs 
we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations  and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which became effective for our company as of january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements under gaap and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the effects of adoption will be determined by the types of instruments carried at fair value in our financial statements at the time of adoption as well as the method utilized to determine their fair values prior to adoption 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the us  the us and france 
our functional currency for our operations in the uk and france is the local currency 
as such  fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all

we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  included within our short term investments are investments in aaa rated student loan auction rate securities 
these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
as of february   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
as a result  we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful 
in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments  we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process  who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par  resulting in a loss 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although  as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable 
changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
