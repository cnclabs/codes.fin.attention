item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with our md a in its entirety 
as the premier long island community bank  our goals are to enhance shareholder value while building a solid banking franchise 
we focus on growing our core businesses of mortgage lending and retail banking while maintaining strong asset quality and controlling operating expenses 
additionally  we continue to provide returns to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases 
we have been successful in achieving these goals over the past several years 
the second half of was highlighted by significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces 
this turbulence has been attributable to a variety of factors  in particular the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market 
one aspect of this fallout has been significant deterioration in the activity of the secondary residential mortgage market 
the disruptions have been exacerbated by the continued decline of the real estate and housing market along with significant mortgage loan related losses incurred by many lending institutions 
subprime mortgage lending  which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market  is not a market that we have ever actively pursued 
additionally  we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards 
however  as a geographically diversified lender  we are not immune to negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and  in particular  a sharp downturn in the housing industry nationally 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
although these market conditions have generally had a negative impact on a majority of mortgage industry participants  they have also provided positive opportunities for prime portfolio lenders like us 
the dislocations in the secondary residential mortgage market have led to fewer participants  and thus less competition in mortgage originations  stricter underwriting standards and wider pricing spreads 
we expect these conditions will enable us to continue to grow our one to four family mortgage loan portfolio while enhancing our credit quality standards 
the turmoil in the mortgage market has impacted the global markets as well as the domestic markets and led to a significant credit and liquidity crisis during the second half of in addition  the significant decline in economic growth  both nationally and globally  during the fourth quarter of has led to a national economy bordering on recession 
in response to these concerns  the fomc reduced the discount rate and federal funds rate by basis points during the second half of and by basis points in january these decreases in short term interest rates have resulted in a more positively sloped yield curve and should result in the eventual expansion of our net interest margin and improved opportunities for earnings growth 
the flat to inverted yield curve which existed throughout and into the first half of limited profitable growth opportunities 
our total loan portfolio increased during the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in one to four family mortgage loans as a result of strong loan originations and purchases reflecting our competitive pricing and the previously discussed dislocations in the secondary residential mortgage market 
total deposits decreased during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in savings  money market and now and demand deposits  partially offset by an increase in certificates of deposit 
during the second half of  as short term market interest rates declined  retail deposit pricing remained at higher levels as certain larger financial institutions attempted to sustain their liquidity by offering deposit products with rates above the market 
we have chosen to maintain our deposit pricing discipline  which has resulted in net deposit outflows  and instead have taken advantage of lower cost borrowings for funding some of our loan growth during the second half of our securities portfolio decreased during the year ended december   which is consistent with our strategy of reducing the portfolio through normal cash flow  as we remain focused on originations of mortgage loans and growth in our loan portfolio 
our borrowings portfolio increased during  primarily as a result of our use of lower cost borrowings to fund some of our loan growth during the second half of the year 
net income  the net interest margin and the net interest rate spread for decreased compared to the prior year 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to decreases in net interest income and non interest income  coupled with an increase in non interest expense 
the decrease in net interest income  as well as the decreases in the net interest margin and the net interest rate spread  were primarily the result of an increase in interest expense due to the cost of interest bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest earning assets 
the interest rate environment  characterized by a flat to inverted yield curve during and into the first half of  coupled with a very competitive environment for deposits  resulted in significant increases in the costs of our certificates of deposits  liquid cds and borrowings 
the decrease in non interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to an other than temporary impairment write down charge to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in two issues of fhlmc perpetual preferred securities and a decrease in mortgage banking income  net  partially offset by an increase in other non interest income and a net gain on the sale of securities 
the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense and other expense  partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense 
in addition  based on our evaluation of the previously discussed issues regarding the real estate and housing markets  as well as the overall economic environment  and in recognition of the increases in non performing loans and net loan charge offs during the second half of  we determined that a provision for loan losses was warranted for the year ended december  the decreases in short term interest rates during the second half of and in january have produced a more positively sloped yield curve and a more favorable interest rate environment for us going forward 
we anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped and steepen further in which should result in improved opportunities for earnings growth and an expansion of our net interest margin 
our focus going forward will be to continue to capitalize on residential mortgage market opportunities that result in improved loan volumes and mortgage spreads 
loan growth may be tempered somewhat as we have reduced the number of states in which we will originate and purchase residential mortgage loans due to the advanced economic declines in those markets 
deposit growth will remain a focus  however  if above market pricing continues  we expect to fund some of our loan growth with lower cost borrowings 
we expect to continue to maintain tangible capital levels between and
