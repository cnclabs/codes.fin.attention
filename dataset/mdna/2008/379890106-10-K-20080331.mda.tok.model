overview glu mobile is a leading global publisher of mobile games 
we have developed and published a portfolio of more than casual and traditional games to appeal to a broad cross section of the subscribers served by our more than wireless carriers and other distributors 
we create games and related applications based on third party licensed brands and other intellectual property  as well as on our own original brands and intellectual property 
our games based on licensed intellectual property include call of duty  deer hunter  diner dash  sonic the hedgehog  transformers  world series of poker and zuma 
our original games based on our own intellectual property include brain genius  frantic factory  my hangman  shadowalker  space monkey and super ko boxing 
we seek to attract end users by developing engaging content that is designed specifically to take advantage of the portability and networked nature of mobile handsets 
we leverage the marketing resources and distribution infrastructures of wireless carriers and the brands and other intellectual property of third party content owners  allowing us to focus our efforts on developing and publishing high quality mobile games 
we believe that improving quality and greater availability of mobile games are increasing end user awareness of and demand for mobile games 
at the same time  carriers and branded content owners are focusing on a small group of publishers that have the ability to produce high quality mobile games consistently and port them rapidly and cost effectively to a wide variety of handsets 
additionally  branded content owners are seeking publishers that have the ability to distribute games globally through relationships with most or all of the major carriers 
we believe we have created the requisite development and porting technology and have achieved the requisite scale to be in this group 
we also believe that leveraging our carrier and content owner relationships will allow us to grow our revenues without corresponding percentage growth in our infrastructure and operating costs 
our revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the mobile game market and our ability to continue to attract new end users in that market 
our ability to attain profitability will be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and 
table of contents administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for our employees 
our operating expenses will continue to grow in absolute dollars  assuming our revenues continue to grow 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect these expenses to decrease 
in march  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  of common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share to the public 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
we were incorporated in may and introduced our first mobile games to the market in july in december and in march  we acquired macrospace and ifone  respectively  each a mobile game developer and publisher based in the united kingdom 
in december  we acquired mig  a leading publisher of mobile games in china and in march  we acquired superscape  a global publisher of mobile games 
we are headquartered in san mateo  california and have offices in san clemente  california  beijing  china  brazil  chile  france  germany  hefei  china  hong kong  italy  russia  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
revenues we generate the vast majority of our revenues from wireless carriers that market and distribute our games 
these carriers generally charge a one time purchase fee or a monthly subscription fee on their subscribers phone bills when the subscribers download our games to their mobile phones 
the carriers perform the billing and collection functions and generally remit to us a contractual fee or a contractual percentage of their collected fee for each game 
we recognize as revenues the percentage of the fees due to us from the carrier see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
end users may also initiate the purchase of our games through various internet portal sites or through other delivery mechanisms  with carriers generally continuing to be responsible for billing  collecting and remitting to us a portion of their fees 
to date  eliminating the impact of our acquisitions  our domestic revenues have grown more rapidly than our international revenues  and this trend may continue 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties that we pay to content owners from which we license brands and other intellectual property and  to a limited extent  to certain external developers 
our cost of revenues also includes non cash expenses amortization of certain acquired intangible assets  any impairment of those intangible assets  and any impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
we record advance royalty payments made to content licensors as prepaid royalties on our balance sheet when payment is made to the licensor 
we recognize royalties in cost of revenues based upon the revenues derived from the relevant game multiplied by the applicable royalty rate 
if our licensors earn royalties in excess of their advance royalties  we also recognize these excess royalties as cost of revenues in the period they are earned by the licensor 
if applicable  we will record an impairment of prepaid royalties or accrue for future guaranteed royalties that are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
at each balance sheet date  we perform a detailed review of prepaid royalties and guarantees that considers multiple factors  including forecasted demand  game life cycle status  game development plans  and current and anticipated sales levels 
we pay some of our external developers  especially in europe  royalties in addition to payments for game development costs 
we recognize these royalties as cost of revenues in the period the developer earns the royalties based upon the revenues derived from the relevant game multiplied by the applicable royalty rate 
we expense the costs for development of our games prior to technological feasibility as we incur them throughout the development process  and we include these costs in research and development expenses see critical accounting policies and estimates software development costs below 
to date  royalties paid to developers have not been significant  but we expect them to increase in aggregate amount based on our existing contracts with developers 

table of contents absent further impairments of existing intangible assets  we expect amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenues to be million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
these amounts would likely increase if we make future acquisitions 
gross margin our gross margin is determined principally by the mix of games that we license 
our games based on licensed intellectual property require us to pay royalties to the licensor and the royalty rates in our licenses vary significantly  our original glu branded games  which are based on our own intellectual property  require no royalty payments to licensors 
there are multiple internal and external factors that affect the mix of revenues from licensed games and glu branded games  including the overall number of licensed games and glu branded games available for sale during a particular period  the extent of our and our carriers marketing efforts for each game  and the deck placement of each game on our carriers mobile handsets 
we believe the success of any individual game during a particular period is affected by its quality and third party ratings  its marketing and media exposure  its consumer recognizability  its overall acceptance by end users and the availability of competitive games 
if our product mix shifts more to licensed games or games with higher royalty rates  our gross margin would decline 
our gross margin is also adversely affected by ongoing amortization of acquired intangible assets  such as licensed content  games  trademarks and carrier contracts that are directly related to revenue generating activities and by periodic charges for impairment of these assets and of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
these charges can cause gross margin variations  particularly from quarter to quarter 
operating expenses our operating expenses primarily include research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
they have in the past also included amortization of acquired intangible assets not directly related to revenue generating activities and  in one period  a restructuring charge and a charge for acquired in process research and development 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for employees working on creating  developing  porting  quality assurance  carrier certification and deployment of our games  on technologies related to interoperating with our various wireless carriers and on our internal platforms  payments to third parties for developing and porting of our games  and allocated facilities costs 
we devote substantial resources to the development  porting and quality assurance of our games and expect this to continue in the future 
we believe that developing games internally through our own development studios allows us to increase operating margins  leverage the technology we have developed and better control game delivery 
our games generally require six months to one year to produce  based on the complexity and feature set of the game developed  the number of carrier wireless platforms and mobile handsets covered  and the experience of the internal or external developer 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute terms as we continue to create new games and technologies  but that these expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for sales and marketing personnel  expenses for advertising  trade shows  public relations and other promotional and marketing activities  expenses for general business development activities  travel and entertainment expenses and allocated facilities costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms with the growth of our business and as we further promote our games and the glu brand 
although we expect our variable marketing expenses to increase at least as rapidly as our revenues  we expect that our sales and marketing headcount will not increase as rapidly as revenues and that therefore sales and marketing expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for general and administrative personnel  consulting fees  legal  accounting and other professional fees  information technology costs and allocated facilities costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute terms as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our 
table of contents business  integration of our recent acquisitions and our operation as a public company 
we also expect that these expenses will increase because of the additional costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and related regulation and our efforts to expand our international operations 
however  we expect these expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
based on our current revenue and expense projections  we expect that our various operating expense categories will decline as a percentage of revenues 
we could fail to increase our revenues as anticipated  and we could decide to increase expenses in one or more categories to respond to competitive pressures or for other reasons 
in these cases and others  it is possible that one or more of our operating expense categories would not decline as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
we record amortization of acquired intangible assets that are directly related to revenue generating activities as part of our cost of revenues and amortization of the remaining acquired intangible assets  such as noncompetition agreements  as part of our operating expenses 
we record intangible assets on our balance sheet based upon their fair value at the time they are acquired 
we determine the fair value of the intangible assets using a discounted cash flows approach 
we amortize the amortizable intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
absent impairments of existing intangible assets  we expect amortization of existing intangible assets to be  in   in and  in these amounts would likely increase if we make future acquisitions 
restructuring charge 
in  we undertook restructuring activities to reduce our ongoing operating expenses 
the resulting restructuring charge principally consisted of costs associated with employee termination benefits 
we recorded these costs as an operating expense when we communicated the benefit arrangement to the employee and no significant future services  other than a minimum retention period  were required of the employee in order to earn the termination benefits 
acquired in process research and development 
we classify all development projects acquired in business combinations as acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  if the feasibility of the acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
we expense the fair value of ipr d at the time it is acquired 
we determine the fair value of the ipr d using a discounted cash flows approach 
in estimating the appropriate discount rate  we consider  among other things  the risks to developing technology given changes in trends and technology in our industry 
in  we expensed the fair value of ipr d acquired in the ifone transaction and in  we expensed the fair value of ipr d acquired in the mig transaction 
in  we will expense the fair value of ipr d as a result of our acquisition of superscape 
gain on sale of assets 
our gain on sale of assets relates entirely to the net proceeds from the sale of our provisionx software to a third party 
we do not anticipate additional gains on asset sales in the future 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  includes interest income  interest expense  accretion of the debt discount related to the warrants issued to pinnacle ventures in conjunction with its march loan to us  changes in our preferred stock warrant liability  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and the write down of certain auction rate securities to their respective fair values 
following the completion of our initial public offering our outstanding warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase common stock and we are no longer required to record changes in our preferred stock warrant liability under staff position no 
 issuer s accounting under fasb statement no 
for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp  or accretion in the debt discount related to the pinnacle ventures warrants 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business 
earnings from our non us activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current united states income tax depending on whether these earnings are subject to us income tax based upon us anti deferral rules  such as subpart f of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
in addition  some 
table of contents revenues generated outside of the united states and the united kingdom may be subject to withholding taxes 
in some cases  these withholding taxes may be deductible on a current basis or may be available as a credit to offset future income taxes depending on a variety of factors 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
such an adjustment would increase our income or goodwill in the period the determination is made 
historically  we have incurred operating losses and have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized certain transfer pricing studies and as a result  we adjusted the federal and state net operating losses and reduced the corresponding valuation allowance 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire from to our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable income may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that result in changes of ownership as defined by section of the code 
as of december   total net operating losses of million are available in the united kingdom  however  million of those losses are limited and can only offset a portion of the annual combined profits in the united kingdom until the net operating losses are fully utilized 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was  our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on june   the fasb issued fsp fsp affirms that freestanding warrants to purchase shares that are redeemable are subject to the requirements in sfas no 
 regardless of the redemption price or the timing of the redemption feature 
therefore  under sfas no 
 the outstanding freestanding warrants to purchase our convertible preferred stock are liabilities that must be recorded at fair value each quarter  with the changes in estimated fair value in the quarter recorded as other expense or income in our statement of operations 
we adopted fsp as of july  and recorded an expense of  for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle to reflect the estimated fair value of these warrants as of that date 
following the completion of the ipo  our outstanding warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase common stock  and we are no longer required to record changes in our preferred stock warrant liability under fsp critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time these estimates and judgments are made  actual results may differ from those estimates  which could affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we believe the following to be critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and they require critical management estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments  short term investments  long lived assets  goodwill  software development costs  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues primarily by licensing software products in the form of mobile games 
license arrangements with our end users can be on a perpetual or subscription basis 
a perpetual license gives an end user the right to use the licensed game on the registered mobile handset on a perpetual basis 
a subscription license gives an end user the right to use the licensed game on the registered handset for a limited period of time  ranging from a few days to as long as one month 
all games that require ongoing delivery of content from us or connectivity through our network for multi player functionality are only billed on a monthly subscription basis 
we distribute our products primarily through wireless carriers  which market our games to end users 
carriers usually bill license fees for perpetual and subscription licenses upon download of the game software by the end user 
in the case of subscription licenses  many subscriber agreements provide for automatic renewal until the subscriber opts out  while the others provide for opt in renewal 
in either case  subsequent billings for subscription licenses are generally billed monthly 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions 
we recognize revenues from our games when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the game has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
for both perpetual and subscription licenses  we consider a signed license agreement to be evidence of an arrangement with a carrier and a clickwrap agreement to be evidence of an arrangement with an end user 
for these licenses  we define delivery as the download of the game by the end user 
we estimate revenues from carriers in the current period when reasonable estimates of these amounts can be made 
several carriers provide reliable interim preliminary reporting and others report sales data within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  both of which allow us to make reasonable estimates of revenues and therefore to recognize revenues during the reporting period when the end user licenses the game 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
our estimates for revenues include consideration of factors such as preliminary sales data  carrier specific historical sales trends  the age of games and the expected impact of newly launched games  successful introduction of new handsets  promotions during the period and economic trends 
when we receive the final carrier reports  to the extent not received within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  we record any differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues in the reporting period when we determine the actual amounts 
historically  the revenues on the final revenue report have not differed by more than one half of of the reported revenues for the period  which we deemed to be immaterial 
revenues earned from certain carriers may not be reasonably estimated 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period  we recognize revenues upon the receipt of a carrier revenue report and when our portion of a game s licensed revenues is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
to monitor the reliability of our estimates  our management  where possible  reviews the 
table of contents revenues by carrier and by game on a weekly basis to identify unusual trends such as differential adoption rates by carriers or the introduction of new handsets 
if we deem a carrier not to be creditworthy  we defer all revenues from the arrangement with that carrier until we receive payment and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recognize as revenues the amount the carrier reports as payable to us upon the sale of our games 
we have evaluated our carrier agreements and have determined that we are not the principal when selling our games through carriers 
key indicators that we evaluated in reaching this determination included wireless subscribers directly contract with their carriers  which have most of the service interaction and are generally viewed as the primary obligor by the subscribers  carriers generally have significant control over the types of games that they offer to their subscribers  carriers are directly responsible for billing and collecting fees from their subscribers  including the resolution of billing disputes  carriers generally pay us a fixed percentage of their revenues or a fixed fee for each game  carriers generally must approve the price of our games in advance of their sale to subscribers  and our more significant carriers generally have the ability to set the ultimate price charged to their subscribers  and we have limited risks  including no inventory risk and limited credit risk 
advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments our royalty expenses consist of fees that we pay to branded content owners for the use of their intellectual property  including trademarks and copyrights  in the development of our games 
royalty based obligations are either paid in advance and capitalized on our balance sheet as prepaid royalties or accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are expensed to cost of revenues at the greater of the revenues derived from the relevant game multiplied by the applicable contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales 
advanced license payments that are not recoupable against future royalties are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the estimated life of the branded title or the term of the license agreement 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of sales to end users 
effective january   we adopted fsp fin  application of fasb interpretation no 
to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners 
as a result  we recorded a minimum guaranteed liability of approximately million as of december  when no significant performance remains with the licensor  we initially record each of these guarantees as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount 
we believe that the contractual amount represents the fair value of our liability 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than upon execution of the contract 
we classify minimum royalty payment obligations as current liabilities to the extent they are contractually due within the next twelve months 
each quarter  we also evaluate the realization of our royalties as well as any unrecognized guarantees not yet paid to determine amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
we use estimates of revenues  cash flows and net margins to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
this evaluation considers multiple factors  including the term of the agreement  forecasted demand  game life cycle status  game development plans and current and anticipated sales levels 
to the extent that this evaluation indicates that the remaining prepaid and guaranteed royalty payments are not recoverable  we record an impairment charge in the period such impairment is indicated 
subsequently  if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  amounts of prepaid royalties previously written down may be utilized  resulting in lower cost of revenues and higher income from operations than previously expected in that period 
in  our cost of revenues was reduced by  as a result of selling games on which the prepaid royalties had previously been impaired 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of zero   and million  respectively 
we believe that the combination of the evolving market for licensing other companies intellectual property and our 
table of contents improved license pre qualification process will reduce risk of future impairments 
the impairments that we have recorded to date are predominantly related to license agreements entered into prior to and had significant guarantees for which the success was tied to a third party product release 
in  and  the market for licensed intellectual property stabilized  resulting in lower upfront commitment fees 
we believe our improved visibility regarding forecasted demand and gaming trends supports our ability to reasonably determine the realizibility of the assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
short term investments we have invested in auction rate securities that are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals set at the time of issuance eg  every seven  or days or every six months  based on the market demand at the reset period 
the stated or contractual maturities for these securities  however  generally are to years 
as of december   we had million of principal invested in two auction rate securities  each of which were rated aaa as of the date of this report  with contractual maturities of we have classified these investments as available for sale securities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  these securities are reported at fair value with any changes in market value reported as a part of comprehensive income loss 
no unrealized gains or losses were recognized during the years ended december   or we periodically review these investments for impairment 
in the event the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  we write down the value of the investment to its fair value 
we recorded an  write down due to a decline in fair value of two failed auctions as of december  that was determined to be other than temporary based on quantitative and qualitative assumptions and estimates using valuation models including a firm liquidation quote provided by the sponsoring broker and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors including the use of cash for the two recent acquisitions  the ratings of the underlying securities  our intent to continue to hold these securities and the continued and further deterioration in the auction rate securities market 
no realized gains or losses were recognized during the years ended december  or long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices  if applicable  or a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives but rather test them for impairment 
sfas requires us to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance at least annually  which we do as of september each year  and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in our impairment review as of september   we looked at two of our reporting units the united states and emea since none of our goodwill was attributable to our third operating unit  the rest of the world  as of that date 
we compare the fair value of each unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the primary methods used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes were the discounted cash flow and 
table of contents market methods 
we determined the assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow method  including the assumed and discount rates for the americas and emea reporting units  respectively  as of september   using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the fair value  we perform an allocation of the unit s fair value to its identifiable tangible and nongoodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this allows us to determine an implied fair value for the unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
to date  no unit s carrying value has exceeded its fair value  and thus we have taken no goodwill impairment charges 
we believe that  as a result of our recent revenue growth  operating results and use of cash  we will begin generating cash flows from operating activities in the latter half of application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  the assigning of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the assigning of goodwill to reporting units and the determining of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments and assumptions include the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including forecasted revenues and costs based on current titles under contract  forecasted new titles that we expect to release  timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and growth rates in terminal values 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the use of the market comparable approach requires judgments regarding the comparability of companies with lines of business similar to ours 
this process is particularly difficult in a situation where no domestic public mobile games companies exist 
the factors used in the selection of comparable companies include growth characteristics as measured by revenue or other financial metrics  margin characteristics  product defined markets served  customer defined markets served  the size of a company as measured by financial metrics such as revenue or market capitalization  the competitive position of a company  such as whether it is a market leader in terms of indicators like market share  and company specific issues that suggest appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular company as a comparable 
we weighted the income and market comparable valuations equally as we did not believe that either method was more appropriate 
further  the total gross value calculated under each method was not materially different  and therefore if the weighting were different we do not believe that this would have significantly impacted our conclusion 
if different comparable companies had been used  the market multiples and resulting estimates of the fair value of our stock would also have been different 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  which could trigger impairment 
software development costs we apply the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  until the product is released for sale  software development costs must be capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of the related product 
we have adopted the tested working model approach to establishing technological feasibility for our games 
under this approach  we do not consider a game in development to have passed the technological feasibility milestone until we have completed a model of the game that contains essentially all the functionality and features of the final game and have tested the model to ensure that it works as expected 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs between the establishment of technological feasibility and the release of a game for sale  thus  we have expensed all software development costs as incurred 
we also will consider the following factors in determining whether costs should be capitalized the emerging nature of the mobile game market  the gradual evolution of the wireless carrier platforms and mobile handsets for which we develop games  the lack of pre orders or sales history for our games  the uncertainty regarding a game s revenue generating potential  our lack of control over the carrier distribution channel resulting in uncertainty as to when  if ever  a game will be available for sale  and our historical practice of canceling games at any stage of the development process 

table of contents stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations  and followed the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 compensation expense for an option was based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of a company s common stock and the exercise price of the option 
apb no 
required companies to record deferred stock based compensation on their balance sheets and amortize it to expense over the vesting periods of the individual options 
we amortize deferred stock based compensation using the multiple option method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  or fin  over the option vesting period using an accelerated amortization schedule 
we expensed employee stock based compensation of million in effective january   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
sfas r requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method  which required us to apply sfas r to option grants on and after the required effective date 
for options granted prior to the january  effective date that remained unvested on that date  we continue to recognize compensation expense under the intrinsic value method of apb no 
in addition  we are continuing to amortize those awards granted prior to january  utilizing an accelerated amortization schedule  while we will expense all options granted or modified on and after january  on a straight line basis 
to value awards granted on or after january   we used the black scholes option pricing model  which requires  among other inputs  an estimate of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and assumptions as to volatility of our stock over the term of the related options  the expected term of the options  the risk free interest rate and the option forfeiture rate 
we determined the assumptions used in this pricing model at each grant date 
we concluded that it was not practicable to calculate the volatility of our share price since our securities have been publicly traded for a limited period of time 
therefore  we based expected volatility on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities 
we determined the expected term of our options based upon historical exercises  post vesting cancellations and the options contractual term 
we based the risk free rate for the expected term of the option on the us treasury constant maturity rate as of the grant date 
we determined the forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience with option cancellations adjusted for unusual or infrequent events 
in  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  of which  represented continued amortization of deferred stock based compensation for options granted prior to and million represented expense recorded in accordance with sfas r with an expected term of approximately years 
in  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  of which  represented continued amortization of deferred stock based compensation for options granted prior to and  represented expense recorded in accordance with sfas r based on options grants with an expected term of approximately 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated by management  we may be required to record adjustments to stock based compensation expense in future periods

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax benefit provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current income tax benefit provision together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  we would need to make an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset  which would increase income in the period that determination was made 
on january  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was  our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
we have not provided federal income taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be reinvested permanently

comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands revenues our revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  almost entirely as a result of volume increases 
the increase resulted from sales of games that we have released in  including ice age  diner dash and super ko boxing  and sales of games acquired from ifone

revenues from ifone games from march   when we acquired ifone  to december  totaled approximately million  primarily in europe and the united states 
revenues in from games released prior to declined by  from the revenues derived from those games in by utilizing our carrier relationships and our marketing and development resources  we were able to increase worldwide distribution and handset porting of ifone games and thus to increase significantly the revenues derived from the licenses that we acquired from ifone

aside from the increase in headcount in our sales and marketing functions  the increase in salaries and benefits cost was due to an increase in variable compensation of  primarily an increase in commissions paid to our sales employees as a result of higher revenue attainment  and  in compensation for transitional employees from ifone who were terminated throughout the second and third quarters of as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses declined from in to in as our sales

general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million in and million in other operating expenses our amortization of intangible assets  such as non competition agreements  acquired from macrospace and ifone was  in both and we had no restructuring charge in  our restructuring charge was  in december  we undertook restructuring activities in order to reduce operating expenses 
we eliminated positions  of which were in research and development  four were in sales and marketing and six were in general and administrative 
of the total restructuring charge recorded   was recorded in the united states and  was recorded in europe 
these restructuring costs were paid in full by march  our acquired in process research and development increased from in to million in the ipr d charge recorded in was related to the development of new games 
we determined the value of acquired ipr d using a discounted cash flows approach 
we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a discount rate 
this rate took into account the percentage of completion of the development effort of approximately and the risks associated with our developing technology given changes in trends and technology in our industry 
as of december   all acquired ipr d projects had been completed at a cost similar to the original projections 
other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  decreased from income of  in to expense of  in this decrease was primarily due to a million expense resulting from an increase in the estimated fair value of warrants issued to pinnacle ventures in conjunction with our loan from them in may and million of interest expense on that loan in the warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any changes in estimated fair value will be recorded as a component of other income expense 
the increase in the estimated fair value of the warrant was due to an increase in the estimated fair value of the underlying preferred stock in these expenses were partially offset by increased foreign currency transaction gains of  and by increased interest income of  in

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for and we derived this information from unaudited consolidated financial statements  which we prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this prospectus 
in our opinion  these unaudited statements include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair statement of that information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents the following table sets forth our historical results  for the periods indicated  as a percentage of our revenues 
for the three months ended march june september december march june september december revenues cost of revenues royalties impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development gain on sale of assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss our revenues generally increased in conjunction with the introduction of new games  the expansion of our wireless carrier distribution channel and the porting of our games to additional mobile handsets 
revenues in the second  third and fourth quarters of were favorably impacted by revenues generated from increased porting and distribution of games acquired from ifone in late march many new mobile handset models are released in the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season 
because many end users download our games soon after they purchase new handsets  we may experience seasonal sales increases based on this key holiday selling period 
however  due to the time between handset purchases and game purchases  most of this holiday impact occurs for us in our first quarter 
for a variety of reasons  we may experience seasonal sales decreases during the summer  particularly in europe  which is predominantly reflected in our third quarter 
in addition to these possible seasonal patterns  we seek to release many of our games in conjunction with specific events  such as the release of a movie or console game 
initial spikes in revenues as a result of successful new releases may create further aberrations in our revenue patterns 
our cost of revenues increased over the above periods as a result of increased royalty payments to licensors and developers caused by increased revenues 
however  our cost of revenues did not increase consistently in all quarters of because of periodic impairment charges and  in the first quarter of  a significant reduction in amortization of intangible assets because a substantial part of the intangible assets acquired from macrospace became fully amortized in december amortization of intangible assets increased in the second quarter of following the acquisition of ifone and in the fourth quarter of following the acquisition of mig 
our quarterly research and development  sales and marketing and general administrative expenses generally increased sequentially in all quarters as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate the growing business on a quarterly basis 

table of contents our acquired in process research and development expense in the first quarter of related to in process projects assumed in the acquisition of ifone for which feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
our acquired in process research and development expense in the fourth quarter of related to certain in process projects assumed in the acquisition of mig 
our gain on sale of assets in the first quarter of related to the net proceeds from the sale of our provisionx software to a third party 
we adopted fsp in july and thus  we recorded the change in estimated fair value of our outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock as part of interest and other income expense  net during all quarters of and the first quarter of until the warrants automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock upon the completion of our ipo and therefore  the warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement 
additionally  we entered into a loan agreement in may recording the amortization of interest expense and debt issuance costs in all subsequent quarters until the loan was repaid in the first quarter of in march  we raised million of net proceeds from our ipo resulting in increased quarterly interest income due to higher cash and short term investment balances 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of  related to auction rate securities that we determined had an other than temporary decline in fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million relating to monetized research and development expenditures in the united kingdom that would otherwise give rise to net operating loss carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately  relating to an adjustment to the macrospace acquired balance sheet  which increased the amount of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with this acquisition 
this benefit should have been recorded in the first quarter of there was no impact of this out of period adjustment on our results of operations 
management has determined that this correction was immaterial to all periods impacted 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded adjustments related to cost of revenues and operating expenses 
the corrections resulted in a net  reduction to loss before income taxes related to prior quarters 
these adjustments would have decreased the reported net loss per share for the three months ended september  per share by per share to per share 
we and the audit committee of our board of directors believe that such amounts are not material to previously reported financial statements 
these adjustments had an immaterial impact on the reported net loss for the years end december   and liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands consolidated statement of cash flows data capital expenditures cash flows used in operating activities cash flows used in provided by investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities since our inception  we have incurred recurring losses and negative annual cash flows from operating activities  and we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our primary sources of liquidity since our inception through our ipo in march have historically been private placements of shares of our preferred stock with aggregate proceeds of million and borrowings under our credit facilities with aggregate proceeds of million 
in march  we completed our ipo of common stock in which we sold and issued  shares at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from our ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 

table of contents operating activities in  we used million of net cash in operating activities as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our net loss by million and increases in accounts payable and stock based compensation of million and million  respectively 
cash used for prepaid and accrued royalties increased from to by million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to use cash in our operating activities during at least the first half of because of anticipated net losses and expected growth in our accounts receivable balance due to the expected growth in our revenues 
additionally  we may decide to enter into new licensing arrangements for existing or new licensed intellectual properties that may require us to make royalty payments at the outset of the agreement 
if we do sign these agreements  this could significantly increase our future use of cash in operating activities 
in  we used million of net cash in operating activities as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased payments of our current liabilities 
cash used for accounts payable  accrued liabilities  accrued royalties and accrued restructuring charge increased from to by million  million   and million  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the payment of liabilities assumed as a part of the ifone acquisition and more timely payment of our third party royalties in this increase was offset in part by a decline in our net loss of million from to  a charge for acquired in process research and development of million in and a decline in our deferred income tax of million from to we expect to continue to use cash in our operating activities during at least the first half of because of anticipated net losses and expected growth in our accounts receivable balance due to the expected growth in our revenues

investing activities our primary investing activities have consisted of purchases and sales of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment and  in and  the acquisitions of mig and ifone  respectively 
we expect to use more cash in investing activities in including million based on the march  closing exchange rate between british pound sterling and united states dollar of for the acquisition of superscape as well as amounts for property and equipment related to the moving of our company headquarters in march we expect to fund these investments with our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in  we used million of cash in investing activities 
this net use of cash resulted from the acquisition of mig  net of cash acquired  of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million offset by the net sales of short term investments of million and proceeds from the sale of provisionx software of million

table of contents in  we generated million of net cash from financing activities  substantially all of which came from the issuance and sale of our preferred stock 
we used million to repay debt issued in connection with the macrospace acquisition 
sufficiency of current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of december  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and any cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including for working capital purposes  capital expenditures and various contractual obligations  for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we anticipate that  from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or assets 
we are currently are in the process of acquiring all outstanding shares of superscape 
upon completion of the tender offer for all outstanding shares  we will be required to pay approximately million based on the march  closing exchange rate between british pound sterling and united states dollar of in cash to its shareholders 
contractual obligations the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations guaranteed royalties fin obligations  including interest and penalties we have entered into license and development arrangements with various owners of brands and other intellectual property so that we can create and publish games for mobile handsets based on that intellectual property 
pursuant to some of these agreements  we are required to pay guaranteed royalties over the term of the contracts regardless of actual game sales 
certain of these minimum payments totaling million have been recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet because payment is not contingent upon performance by the licensor 
as of december   unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties are classified within other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement of our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those non financial assets and non financial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
eligible items include but are not limited to  accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  issued debt and firm commitments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk we have exposure to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
all of our current investments are classified as cash equivalents or short term investments 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
as of december   we had million of principal invested in auction rate securities  all of which were rated aaa at the time of purchase 
auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals established at the time of issuance eg  every seven   or days  every six months  etc  based on market demand for a reset period 
the stated or contractual maturities for these securities  however  generally are to years 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a competitive bidding process often referred to as a dutch auction 
if there is insufficient interest in the securities at the time of an 
table of contents auction  the auction may not be completed and the rates may be reset to predetermined penalty or maximum rates 
the monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
following a failed auction  we would not be able to access our funds that are invested in the corresponding auction rate securities until a future auction of these investments is successful or new buyers express interest in purchasing these securities in between reset dates 
given the current negative liquidity conditions in the global credit and capital markets  the auction rate securities held by us at december  have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
the underlying assets of our auction rate securities are corporate bonds 
if the underlying issuers are unable to successfully clear future auctions or if their credit rating deteriorates and the deterioration is deemed to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities through an impairment charge to earnings 
any of these events could materially affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we have recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  reflecting the decrease in estimated value of our auction rate securities as of december  that were determined to be other than temporary as a result of two failed auctions 
as of december   the contractual maturities of investments held were greater than five years 
however  we had the ability and intent  if necessary  to liquidate any of these investments as needed in order to meet our needs within our normal operating cycles 
accordingly  all investments were classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  all auction rate securities were included in short term investments 
as of december   the contractual maturities of our remaining two auction rate securities were although we may not have the ability to liquidate these investments within one year of the balance sheet date  we may need to sell the securities within the next year to fund operations 
accordingly  the investments were classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in if uncertainties in these markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio including on auction rate securities  we may incur additional impairments to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states  the united kingdom  brazil  chile  china  france  germany  hong kong  italy and spain and our current deposits are likely in excess of insured limits 
we believe that the financial institutions that hold our investments are financially sound and  accordingly  minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments 
our accounts receivable primarily relate to revenues earned from domestic and international wireless carriers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our carriers financial condition but generally require no collateral from them 
as of december   verizon wireless accounted for of our total accounts receivable and no other carrier represented more than of our total accounts receivable 
as of december   verizon wireless  sprint nextel and vodafone accounted for  and of our total accounts receivable  respectively 
foreign currency risk the functional currencies of our united states and united kingdom operations are the united states dollar  or usd  and the pound sterling  respectively 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the usd or the pound sterling 
our revenues are usually denominated in the functional currency of the carrier 
operating expenses are usually in the local currency of the operating unit  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to currency fluctuations 
intercompany transactions between our domestic and foreign operations are denominated in either the usd or the pound sterling 
at month end  foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income expense  net 

table of contents our foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations in the pound sterling versus the usd and in the euro versus the pound sterling 
it is uncertain whether these currency trends will continue 
in the future  we may experience foreign currency exchange losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables 
foreign currency exchange losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  in which our chinese operations principally transact business  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit out ability to react to foreign currency devaluations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
