this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the factors and uncertainties that may affect future results section of this item the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview this overview is not a complete discussion of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the discussion that follows 
the detailed discussion and analysis that follows must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the company s financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers  which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia  europe and the middle east 
the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that we believe provide the most comprehensive offering of materials integrity management products and services to the microelectronics industry 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth  while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable product class includes wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products  membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters and resin based gas purifiers  as well as pva roller brushes for use in post cmp cleaning applications 
the company s capital expense driven products include its process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers  components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes 
on december   the company s board of directors approved a change in fiscal year end from a week or week fiscal year period ending on the last saturday of august to december  effective as of december  as a result  the financial periods presented and discussed in this annual report on form k will be defined as follows i years ended december  and representing the twelve months ended december  and  ii four month transition period ended december  representing the four months ended december   and iii year ended august  representing the twelve months ended august  key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a large portion of the company s product costs excepting raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to effects of industry cyclicality  technological change and substantial competition  including pricing pressures 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially resin and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
fixed cost structure increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net sales were million  down million  or  from net sales of million reported for the year ended december  due to lower demand for the company s products  in part reflecting the demand drivers of the semiconductor industry 
the sales comparison is positively affected by approximately million due to the year over year strengthening of certain international currencies versus the us dollar over the period  most notably the euro 
net sales for were positively affected by the inclusion of approximately million in sales attributable to a third quarter acquisition 
mainly reflecting the year over year sales decrease and the corresponding lower factory utilization  the company reported lower gross profits and a reduced gross margin 
the company s gross margin in was versus a year earlier 
the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in the year over year reduction reflected lower costs incurred by the company in connection with the integration activities associated with the merger with mykrolis as well as the benefit of lower salaries and other costs resulting from the realignment of activities after the merger 
the company reported income from continuing operations of million for compared to million in included in income from continuing operations in was the second quarter pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s interest in a privately held equity investment and the fourth quarter us tax benefit of million associated with the repatriation and recharacterization of million of the company s japanese subsidiary s accumulated undistributed earnings 
during  the company generated cash of million from continuing operations as a result of the cash generated by the company s net earnings  non cash charges and the net positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities  most notably decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
despite the cash generated by operations  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments declined to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease mainly reflects the use of million to purchase the company s common shares in connection with its second quarter dutch auction tender offer and fourth quarter rule b trading plan  million to acquire a specialty coatings business in the third quarter and million to acquire property and equipment 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  business combinations and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
net sales the company s net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment  primarily fob shipping point  when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable based upon historical collection results and regular credit evaluations 
in most transactions  the company has no obligations to its customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in the event that significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties exist such as customer acceptance  revenue recognition is deferred as appropriate until such obligations are fulfilled or the uncertainties are resolved 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances and historical bad debts write off experience when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at december  and december   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and sales levels by product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full valuation allowance is recorded 
in addition  valuation allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory valuation allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions  additional inventory write downs or valuation allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the assets is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which would trigger an impairment review and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
the company carried no valuation allowance as of december  compared to a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  related to a portion of a capital loss carryforward which at that time was deemed more likely than not to be unrealized 
the elimination of the valuation allowance during the quarter ended june  reflected the utilization of the capital loss carryforward to offset a portion of the capital gain on the sale of an equity investment 
warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
estimated claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at december  and december   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income 
accordingly  for significant items  the company typically obtains assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  the company normally utilizes the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact net income 
share based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
under sfas r  the company must estimate the value of employee stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of employee stock options was estimated on the date of grant in connection with the determination of the pro forma share based compensation disclosures required by sfas using the black scholes model 
the fair value of share based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
no employee stock options have been awarded by the company since its adoption of sfas r 
restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
certain restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards involve stock to be issued upon the achievement of performance conditions performance shares under the company s stock incentive plans 
such performance shares become available subject to time based vesting conditions if  and to the extent that  financial performance criteria for the applicable fiscal year or multi year period are achieved 
accordingly  the number of performance shares earned will vary based on the level of achievement of financial performance objectives for the applicable period 
until such time that the company s performance can ultimately be determined  each quarter the company estimates the number of performance shares more likely than not to be earned based on an evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods when the underlying factors change the company s evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
accordingly  share based compensation expense associated with performance shares recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and december  the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

net sales for fiscal included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million 
this reflected the strengthening of certain international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the euro 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in sales from products of the high purity semiconductor coatings business acquired in the third quarter totaled million in demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in decreased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for the year ended december   indicating a consistent pattern of demand within the industry over the past twelve months 
sales of unit driven products fell in as semiconductor fab utilization rates were relatively flat 
unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  and in wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as in chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
sales of wafer shippers declined  while sales of disk shippers fell primarily due to lower sales of mm shippers 
year over year sales of capital driven products decreased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of liquid systems also declined in the latter half of  reflecting the general slowing in the industry 
wafer transport products  such as mm foup products  also fell  particularly at some north american customers 
sales of gas microcontamination control products fell after reaching peak levels in gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the gross profit decline was primarily due to the lower utilization of the company s production facilities compared to the prior period 
production volumes were considerably lower in as the company sold inventory on hand to satisfy customer demand  particularly in the first half of the year 
prices for raw materials were relatively stable on a year over year basis 
gross margin for also was affected by million in transition costs such as travel  sampling and customer qualification costs related to the transfer of four product lines from us facilities to the company s facility in kulim  malaysia 
costs of million associated with the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities in the us and singapore also reduced gross profit in gross margin in included a million cost of sales charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the purchase of the assets of the high purity semiconductor coatings business acquired in the third quarter of the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and is charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory 
gross profit in was reduced by costs of million incurred in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan 
offsetting these charges to gross profit was a gain of million on the sale of a facility recognized during the second quarter of gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of was lower than the strong levels achieved earlier in the year due to manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at a north american plant in the third quarter and expenses incurred in the fourth quarter in connection with a comprehensive worldwide review of the company s manufacturing operations to identify and resolve manufacturing inefficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for decreased million  or  compared to million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from a year earlier 
the year over year decrease in sg a costs reflects the lower sg a expenses incurred by the company in connection with the integration activities associated with the mykrolis merger and other realignment activities  as well as the benefit of the consolidation of various sales  marketing and other corporate functions during costs of million were incurred by the company in in connection with the integration and realignment activities associated with the mykrolis merger  compared to million in the costs included in this category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate mykrolis operations and systems into the company s pre existing operations and systems 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the integration of information systems  employee benefits and compensation  accounting finance  tax  treasury  risk management  compliance  administrative services  sales and marketing and other functions and include severance and retention costs 
the year over year decrease in sg a expenses also includes a decline in incremental share based compensation expense of million  offset by an increase in professional fees of million 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses rose by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago 
the increase reflected higher product sampling costs as the company continued to focus on the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net net interest income was million in compared to million in the decrease reflects lower average invested balances compared to a year ago primarily related to the company s use of cash to finance the repurchase of its common shares during the second quarter of other income other income in includes a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s interest in a privately held equity investment accounted for using the cost method 
proceeds from the sale totaled million 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate was in compared with a rate a year earlier 
the company s tax rate was lower than statutory rates for a number of reasons 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s japanese subsidiary declared a dividend of billion yen approximately us million and also loaned billion yen approximately us million to the company 
the resulting recharacterization of million of the japanese subsidiary s accumulated undistributed earnings resulted in a fourth quarter tax benefit of million  net of state income tax expense 
the company also benefited from a tax holiday in malaysia whereby  as a result of employment commitments  research and development expenditures and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits in in the amount of million 
in  the company s benefit from the tax holiday was million 
the effective tax rate was also lower due to a corporate income tax refund of million resulting from new legislation in germany and a million favorable adjustment recorded to recognize the reconciliation of the company s federal tax return and tax accounts 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase to the company s tax contingency reserves 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded losses of million  net of taxes  in these results included an operating loss of million  a pre tax impairment charge of million recorded in connection with the write down of long lived assets to fair value less cost to sell and a tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance  resulting from the utilization of a capital loss carryforward to offset a portion of the capital gain on the sale of an equity investment 
the company s discontinued operations recorded income of million net of taxes for the after tax earnings of discontinued operations in included a tax benefit of million associated with a decrease in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance described above 
the change in the valuation allowance resulted from the settlement of negotiations regarding the terms of sale of a discontinued operation which established the characterization of certain gains and losses 
net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  unaudited the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and december  the company s historical financial data were derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
all adjustments which management considers necessary for the fair presentation of the unaudited information have been included in the period presented

the increase in net sales reflects the inclusion of sales from the former mykrolis operations for the full year in versus only the five month period from august  through december  for the prior period 
such incremental sales totaled million and accounted for approximately of the year over year increase 
net sales for fiscal included unfavorable foreign currency translation effects  principally related to the japanese yen  versus the us dollar in the amount of million 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in demand drivers for the company s business primarily are comprised of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for the year ended december  sales of unit driven products grew in as semiconductor fab utilization rates remained strong and stable 
unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes and in wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as in chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
demand for liquid filters remained relatively stable for most of these semiconductor applications  but sales of these products to non semiconductor customers declined modestly 
sales of wafer shippers increased modestly due to higher sales of mm wafer shipper products 
sales of disk shippers for data storage products were also higher  as the market for mm devices remained strong 
year over year sales of capital driven products generally improved in  with strong sales during the first half of the year and a decline during the second half of  reflecting a general slowing of the industry  particularly in north america 
capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems  used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of liquid systems grew during the first half of the year  but declined later in  reflecting a general slowing in the industry 
wafer transport products  such as mm foup products  also reflected slower capital spending  particularly at some north american customers 
sales of gas microcontamination control products reached the all time high in  reflecting the market acceptance of the company s gas purification systems and liquid lens system used on advanced lithography steppers 
sequentially  sales for the fourth quarter of were lower than the third quarter of due to lower sales of capital driven products 
unit driven sales remained stable  reflecting flat levels of wafer starts and semiconductor production 
this was in contrast to significantly lower sales of capital driven products  due in part to softening in demand  particularly from north american customers 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million to million  an increase of from million for the comparable period 
the gross margin percentage for was versus for the comparable period 
the gross profit and gross margin improvements for the year ended december  compared to the prior year were mainly due to the addition of the former mykrolis operations  particularly the inclusion of sales of gas microcontamination and liquid microcontamination product lines as these products typically carry higher gross margins than the company s other products 
the company also benefited from improved sales levels resulting in improved utilization of its manufacturing facilities 
prices for raw materials were relatively stable sequentially and compared to the year ago period 
gross profit in was reduced by costs of million incurred in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan 
offsetting these charges to gross profit was a gain of million on the sale of a facility recognized during the second quarter of gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of was lower than the strong levels achieved earlier in the year due to manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at a north american plant in the third quarter and expenses incurred in the fourth quarter in connection with a comprehensive worldwide review of the company s manufacturing operations to identify and resolve manufacturing inefficiencies 
gross profit in was significantly affected by the inclusion of million in incremental charges associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the merger with mykrolis 
the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and was charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory during the third and fourth quarters of also during  the company incurred costs of million associated with the realignment of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan and its production and administrative activities  including million in accelerated depreciation and impairment charges associated with assets sold or in connection with realignment activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for increased million  or compared to million in the comparable period a year ago 
sg a expenses as a percent of net sales fell to from a year earlier 
the lower sg a costs as a percent of net sales reflect the benefit of cost reductions associated with the merging of the two entities 
the year over year increase in sg a costs reflect the addition of sg a expenses associated with mykrolis infrastructure as well as increased amortization of intangibles of million 
costs of million were incurred by the company in connection with the integration and realignment activities associated with the mykrolis merger compared to million in the costs included in the latter category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate mykrolis operations and systems into the company s pre existing operations and systems 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the integration of information systems  employee benefits and compensation  accounting finance  tax  treasury  risk management  compliance  administrative services  sales and marketing and other functions and includes severance and retention costs 
sg a costs fell during the second half of as cost containment measures were put in place in the face of slowing sales and as integration activities were completed 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses rose by million  or  to million in compared to million for the year ended december  the increases mainly reflect the inclusion of er d expenses associated with former mykrolis operations 
er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to in the prior year 
the company continued to focus on supporting current product lines and developing new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net net interest income was million in compared to million in the prior year period 
the increase reflects the considerably higher rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities as well as the higher average net invested balance compared to the prior year period  associated in part with the cash and short term investments acquired in the mykrolis merger 
income tax expense benefit the company recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million for the comparable period a year ago 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared with a rate a year earlier 
the company s tax rate was lower than statutory rates due to the benefits associated with export activities and a tax holiday in malaysia whereby as a result of employment commitments  research and development expenditures and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits in in the amount of million 
in  the company s had tax benefits from the malaysian tax holiday in the amount of million 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded a loss before income taxes of million in the income from discontinued operations included a tax benefit of million recorded in the first quarter of related to the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from the resolution of a matter with respect to the characterization of certain gains and losses 
net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the comparable period 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year period

sales were adversely affected by approximately million due to the weakening of international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably in japan 
on a geographic basis  total regional sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan 
industry indicators during the period were largely positive 
semiconductor device makers and foundries reported continued high fab utilization rates  both at the advanced technology nodes and for nand flash and other memory devices 
capital spending was also generally favorable 
these trends were reflected across unit driven products 
in particular  sales of liquid filtration and purification products  which represent almost half of unit driven sales  improved over the comparable period a year earlier 
strength in japan and north america was offset by relative weakness in europe  whose order trends typically trail those in other geographies 
sales of wafer shippers rose during the period  driven by demand for product for mm and below 
sales of other unit driven products were mixed 
strong sales of gas microcontamination filters and purifiers  which are used on a broad spectrum of gas and vacuum based tools  offset lower sales of shippers for data storage devices and matrix trays for finished electronic products 
among capital driven products  sales of mm wafer carriers improved over the comparable period a year earlier 
sales of these products are primarily driven by the timing of new fab construction  and as such  demand can be variable from period to period

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest bearing cash equivalents and certain long term debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
most of the company s long term debt at december  carries fixed rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents are instruments with maturities of three months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately million annually 
the cash flows and earnings of the company s foreign based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign based operations 
at december   the company was party to forward contracts to deliver japanese yen  taiwanese dollars  euros  israeli new shekels  malaysia ringgits  and singapore dollars with notional values of approximately million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively

during the term of this transaction  the company remitted to  and received from  its counterparty interest payments based on rates that were reset quarterly equal to three month japanese libor and three month us libor rates  respectively 
the company designated this hedging instrument as a hedge of a portion of the net investment in its japanese subsidiary  and used the spot rate method of accounting to value changes of the hedging instrument attributable to currency rate fluctuations 
accordingly  a million adjustment in the fair market value of the hedging instrument related to changes in the spot rate was recorded as a charge to foreign currency translation within accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity in to offset changes in a portion of the yen denominated net investment in the company s japanese subsidiary and will remain there until the net investment is disposed 
the company recorded million in net interest income in in connection with the cross currency interest rate swap 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of materials  including polymers and stainless steel  was generally flat compared to one year ago due to increased production capacity of suppliers  despite higher oil prices 
entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase notably in due to the tightening of production capacity of its suppliers  a weak us dollar driving strong demand for these materials overseas  particularly polymer based resins  and projected higher oil prices 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits rose slightly in fiscal and moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with its large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
