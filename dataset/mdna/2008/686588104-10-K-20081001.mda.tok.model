during the second half of fiscal year  all of fiscal years and as well as subsequent to the fiscal year end  the company faced several challenges relating to unfavorable market conditions in the housing industry  including a increased new and resale home inventory levels including the growing number of foreclosed homes offered at substantially reduced prices  b decreased homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the overall housing market  c increased uncertainty in the overall mortgage market  and d increased mortgage underwriting standards 
the decrease in homebuyer demand as a result of lower consumer confidence can be attributed to concerns of prospective buyers of new homes about the direction of home prices  which has increased general homebuyer uncertainty regarding whether it is the right time to buy a home 
the uncertainty in the mortgage market is partially the result of concerns regarding the sub prime mortgage market  which has experienced rising delinquencies and defaults by borrowers as they experience financial difficulties due to rising interest rates 
this credit deterioration has led to the bankruptcies of major sub prime mortgage lenders  reduced general availability of mortgage financing and the tightening of lending standards 
while the company has minimal exposure to the sub prime markets  these factors may make it more difficult for our potential customers to sell their existing homes 
these market challenges are evidenced by the overall reduction in new orders for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  new orders decreased  or  which represents homes 
as a result of these and other challenges  the company recorded inventory impairments and write offs of abandoned projects and other pre acquisition costs

the company continues to respond to the uncertainties noted above by increasing sales incentives and offering limited time promotions with the objective of improving new orders and reducing home inventory levels 
similarly  the company assesses whether goodwill is impaired 
this assessment is based on the estimated future cash flows 
actual results could differ from such estimates which could result in the determination that the goodwill is no longer recoverable 
during the fiscal year ended june   a valuation allowance was established in the amount of  for the deferred tax assets due to the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
sfas no 
provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized additional impairment charges of  reflecting the impact of cumulative out of period adjustments

employee retirement plan on december   the company adopted an unfunded  non qualified target defined benefit retirement plan  effective as of september   which covers a group of management employees of the company 
the company owns life insurance policies on all participants in the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this serp  which was amended on march   and september   is intended to provide the participants with an annual supplemental retirement benefit based upon their years of service with the company and highest average compensation for five consecutive years 
the annual supplemental benefit for each participant will be adjusted based on the actual performance of the serp compared to the target 
the benefit is payable for life with a minimum of ten years guaranteed 
in order to qualify for normal retirement benefits  a participant must attain age with at least five years of participation in the serp 
early retirement will be permitted beginning at age  after five years of participation in the serp 
early retirement benefits will be adjusted actuarially to reflect the early retirement date 
if a participant terminates employment with the company prior to attaining his or her normal retirement age  other than by reason of early retirement  death or disability  the participant generally will forfeit all benefits under the serp 
the company can amend or terminate the serp at any time 
however  no amendment or termination will affect the participants accrued benefits as determined in accordance with the serp or delay any payments to a participant beyond the time that such amount would otherwise be payable without regard to the amendment 
deferred compensation plan on december   the company adopted an executive compensation deferral plan the deferral plan effective as of june  under the plan  participants will have the ability to defer a portion of their compensation which will be credited to an account maintained by the company for the participant 
amounts contributed by participants are always vested 
participant deferral accounts will be maintained by the company for recordkeeping purposes only 
participants will have no interest in any assets which may be set aside by the company to meet its obligations under the deferral plan 
share repurchase program in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the repurchases  may be made from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at the company s discretion and in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
effective june  and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the fourth amendment  the company is no longer permitted to repurchase shares of common stock 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during the fiscal years ended june  and cash flow statement net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  of  this increase was primarily attributable to approximately  of income tax refunds received during fiscal year  an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities in fiscal year ended june  as compared to a decrease in fiscal year and a larger decrease in real estate held for development and sale in the current fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year 
the difference in accounts payable and other liabilities was primarily due to better management of payables 
the change in real estate held for development and sale was primarily due to lower spending on new land 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the net loss 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily related to the sale of our western region from which we received proceeds of  net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the fiscal year ended june  the change was primarily due to net payments of loans secured by real estate assets of  in fiscal year as compared to net borrowings of loans secured by real estate assets of  in fiscal year lot positions as of june   the company owned or controlled approximately  building lots 
included in the aforementioned lots  the company had contracted to purchase  or has under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  that are expected to yield approximately  building lots 
undeveloped land acquisitions the process of acquiring desirable undeveloped land is extremely competitive  particularly in the northern region  mostly due to the lack of available parcels suitable for development 
in addition  expansion of regulation in the housing industry has increased the time it takes to acquire undeveloped land with all of the necessary governmental approvals required to begin construction 
generally  the company structures its land acquisitions so that it has the right to cancel its agreements to purchase undeveloped land by forfeiture of its deposit under the agreement 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company forfeited  of land deposits and expensed an additional  of pre acquisition costs related to the write off of purchase agreements with respect to undeveloped land 
included in the balance sheet captions inventory not owned variable interest entities and land deposits and costs of future development  at june  the company had  invested in parcels of undeveloped land  of which  is cash deposits  a portion of which is non refundable 
at june   overall undeveloped parcels of land under contract had an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and were expected to yield approximately  building lots 
the company attempts to further mitigate the risks involved in acquiring undeveloped land by structuring its undeveloped land acquisitions so that the deposits required under the agreements coincide with certain benchmarks in the governmental approval process  thereby limiting the amount at risk 
this process allows the company to periodically review the approval process and make a decision on the viability of developing the parcel to be acquired based upon expected profitability 
in some circumstances the company may be required to make deposits solely due to the passage of time 
this structure still provides the company an opportunity to periodically review the viability of developing the parcel of land 
in addition  the company primarily structures its agreements to purchase undeveloped land to be contingent upon obtaining all governmental approvals necessary for construction 
under most agreements  the company secures the responsibility for obtaining the required governmental approvals as the company believes that it has significant expertise in this area 
the company intends to complete the acquisition of undeveloped land only after all governmental approvals are in place 
in certain rare circumstances  however  when all extensions have been exhausted  the company must make a decision on whether to proceed with the purchase even though all governmental approvals have not yet been received 
in these circumstances  the company performs reasonable due diligence to ascertain the likelihood that the necessary governmental approvals will be granted 
improved lot acquisitions the process of acquiring improved building lots from developers is extremely competitive 
the company competes with many homebuilders to acquire improved building lots  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the acquisition of improved lots is usually less risky than the acquisition of undeveloped land as the contingencies and risks involved in the land development process are borne by the developer rather than the company 
in addition  governmental approvals are generally in place when the improved building lots are acquired 
at june   the company had contracted to purchase or had under option approximately improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  at june   the company had  invested in these improved building lots  of which  is deposits 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company forfeited of land deposits with respect to improved building lots 
the company expects to utilize primarily the revolving credit facility as described above as well as other existing capital resources  to finance the acquisitions of undeveloped land and improved lots described above 
the company anticipates completing a majority of these acquisitions during the next several years 
inflation we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation may also increase our financing  labor  and material costs 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand 
while we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices  the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in many of our markets 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting our prospective homebuyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins  and net income would be adversely affected 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments certain off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments are disclosed in various sections of the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and below 
some typical off balance sheet arrangements affecting the company and commonly affecting homebuilders in general  include cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements  debt and debt service guarantees  surety bonds and standby letters of credit  executed contracts for construction and development activity  and variable interest entities  which are not consolidated 
each of these items is described below or in critical accounting policies following this section 
cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements 
the company has developed and owned communities through joint ventures  accounted for using the equity method  with other parties in the past 
however  at the present time joint venture activities do not constitute a material portion of the company s operations 
in addition  the company has partnered with other homebuilders and developers  under cost sharing agreements  to acquire land and or to develop or improve common off site facilities  such as sewer treatment plants  that will benefit both parties 
most of these agreements are established as cost sharing agreements whereby the homebuilders and developers share in the cost of acquiring the parcel or improving the off site facility 
the company currently does not have any material unfunded commitments or capital contribution requirements with respect to joint ventures or cost sharing arrangements 
debt and debt service guarantees 
at june   the company had mortgage and other note obligations  subordinated notes  and other notes payable on the balance sheet totaling  the company currently does not have any off balance sheet debt service guarantees 
surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
as of june   the company had  in surety bonds and  in outstanding standby letters of credit in favor of local municipalities or financial institutions to guarantee the construction of real property improvements or financial obligations 
the surety bonds guarantee the construction of public improvements and infrastructure such as sewer  streets  traffic signals  grading  and wildlife preservations in connection with the various communities the company is developing 
surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from homebuilders and other real estate developers 
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit are renewable and expire upon completion of the required improvements 
standby letters of credit are a form of credit enhancement that is commonly required in real estate development to secure the construction of public improvements 
in the past three fiscal years  no surety bonds or standby letters of credit have been drawn on for use to satisfy the company s obligations to perform under the agreements with the public agencies 
executed contracts for site work and construction activity 
the company has entered into site work and construction contracts with various suppliers and contractors 
these contracts are for construction and development activity in the numerous communities the company has under development  and are originated in the normal course of business 
the site work contracts generally require specific performance by the contractor to prepare the land for construction and are written on a community by community basis 
for larger communities  site work contracts are awarded in phases in order to limit any long term commitment by the company or its contractors 
generally  site work contracts are completed in less than one year 
the company acts as a general contractor and contracts with various subcontractors at specified prices for construction of the homes it sells 
subcontractors generally work on a piece meal basis and are not awarded contracts for a specified number of homes 
these commitments are typically funded by the company s revolving credit facility and cash from operations 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the fasb issued a revised fin fin r in december which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretations 
a variable interest entity vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie  pursuant to fin r  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
based on the provisions of fin r  the company has concluded that whenever it enters into an option agreement to acquire land or lots from an entity and pays a significant deposit that is not unconditionally refundable  a vie is created under condition ii b of the previous paragraph 
the company has been deemed to have provided subordinated financial support  which refers to variable interests that will absorb some or all of an entity s expected theoretical losses if they occur 
for each vie created  the company will compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin r 
if the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie it will consolidate the vie on its balance sheet 
the fair value of the vies inventory will be reported as inventory not owned variable interest entities 
at june   the company consolidated three vies as a result of its options to purchase land or lots from the selling entities 
the company paid cash of and issued letters of credit deposits of to these vies and incurred additional pre acquisition costs totaling  the company s deposits and any costs incurred prior to acquisition of the land or lots represent the company s maximum exposure to loss 
the fair value of the vies inventory is reported as inventory not owned variable interest entities 
the company recorded  in inventory not owned variable interest entities as of june  the fair value of the property to be acquired less cash deposits and pre acquisition costs  which totaled  at june   was reported on the balance sheet as obligations related to inventory not owned variable interest entities 
creditors  if any  of these vies have no recourse against the company 
the company will continue to secure land and lots using options 
excluding the deposits and other costs capitalized in connection with the vies discussed in the prior paragraph  the company had total costs incurred to acquire land and lots at june  of approximately  including  of cash deposits 
the total purchase price under these cancelable contracts or options is approximately  the maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits  although some deposits are refundable  and costs incurred prior to the acquisition of the land or lots 
summary of outstanding obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
for mortgage and other note obligations  payments due by period are shown based on the expiration date of the loan 
payments due during fiscal year ended june  payments due thereafter total obligations mortgage and other note obligations interest on subordinated notes operating leases affordable housing contributions total obligations the above table does not include certain obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  such as trade payables 
the above table also does not include any amounts needed to acquire lots or land under option or cancelable purchase contracts because these arrangements are completed only at the company s discretion  subject only to loss of option or deposit amounts and costs capitalized to date 
therefore  these option and cancelable purchase contracts do not represent binding enforceable purchase obligations 
as of june   the company had contracted to purchase  or had under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  that are expected to yield approximately  lots 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of real estate assets  capitalization of costs  environmental liability exposure  miscellaneous litigation reserves  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made  we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of certain events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of recorded assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant  subjective or complex judgments  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the fasb issued a revised fin fin r in december which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretations 
variable interest entities are entities controlled by another entity through means other than voting rights 
fin r provides guidance on determining whether and how a business enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity 
fin r requires significant use of judgment and estimates in determining its application 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of fin r 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  sfas requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the sfas more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
during the fiscal year ended june   we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of  the valuation allowance was established due to the lack of objectively verifiable evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we have incurred a cumulative loss and also considered the continued difficult current market conditions  as well as losses and impairment charges which led to the impairments of certain real estate held for development or sale 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates could have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
estimates 
as more fully explained under the caption inventories and goodwill  when an impairment is indicated  impairment charges are recorded to reduce the company s i real estate inventories to fair value and ii goodwill balances to its fair value 
these impairment amounts consider estimated future cash flows which are dependent upon management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows  which include assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of the company s impairment charges could be materially affected by changes in market conditions or expectations for changes in market conditions 
estimates of construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and community and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs differ from those estimated at the time of closing  adjustments to cost of sales could be recorded 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the estimated relative sales value and then allocated to the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision 
such cost estimates and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  changes in amounts allocated to future lots in that project would be adjusted to reflect such changes 
revenue recognition and cost of sales 
the company primarily derives its total earned revenues from the sale of residential property 
the company recognizes residential revenue when title is conveyed to the homebuyer at the time of closing 
from time to time  the company also sells developed and undeveloped land in bulk and under option agreements 
revenues from sales of land and other real estate are recognized when the company has received an adequate cash down payment and all other conditions necessary for profit recognition have been satisfied 
during fiscal years  and  all sales transactions met the criteria for and were accounted for utilizing the full accrual method 
however  as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  two land sales where the company retained the option to repurchase finished lots was accounted for as a financing transaction 
to the extent that certain sales or portions thereof do not meet all conditions necessary for profit recognition  the company would use other methods to recognize profit  including the percentage of completion  cost recovery and the deposit methods 
these methods of profit recognition defer a portion or all of the profit to the extent it is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
costs incurred for homes closed include those which are specifically identified to the home such as construction costs and all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based on the allocated cost amount to the lot sold 
allocations of such costs to the lot sold generally  include a pro rata allocation determined based on the number of lots expected to be sold  where appropriate  costs may first be allocated based on a relative sales value method and then applied to the number of lots expected to be sold 
estimates of future costs to be incurred after the completion of each sale are included in cost of sales 
a change in circumstances that causes these estimates of future costs to increase or decrease significantly would affect the gain or loss recognized on future sales 
from time to time  the company will sell and lease back its model homes 
the company accounts for sale leaseback transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases statement no 

inventories 
inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value 
inventory costs include land  land development and home construction costs  real estate taxes  indirect project costs and interest related to development and construction 
we review inventories for impairment during each reporting period on a community by community basis 
where there are multiple communities located within a parcel  the impairment is determined at the overall parcel level 
sfas no 
requires that if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than its carrying amount  impairment is indicated and an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
in conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  the margins on homes that have been delivered  margins under sales contracts in backlog  projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  and the fair value of the land itself 
in determining the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets in a community that we have evaluated as requiring a test for impairment  significant quantitative and qualitative assumptions are made relative to the future home sales prices  sales incentives  direct and indirect costs including interest expected to be capitalized and home construction and land development and the pace of new home orders 
in addition  these assumptions are dependent on the specific market conditions and competitive factors for the community being tested 
our estimates are made using information available at the date of the recoverability test 
however  as facts and circumstances may change in future reporting periods  our estimates of recoverability are subject to change 
when impairment is indicated  we estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model 
the determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 
as of june   there were a number of parcels which were tested for impairment as a trigger was identified 
some of these parcels included those that had previously been impaired 
in some cases  the undiscounted cash flow analysis prepared by management did not indicate an impairment  requiring the asset to be written down to its fair value 
however  these cash flows are subject to significant estimates and assumptions made by management 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated from the undiscounted cash flow analysis is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
these parcels could suffer impairment in the future  and such impairment amounts could be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
as noted above  when impairment is indicated  we estimate the fair value of inventory under sfas no 
based on current market conditions and current assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change 
for example  further market deterioration may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory  as well as on inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs 
in estimating the fair value of the property  the company believes that a market participant would obtain financing at market rates 
the financing considers cash flows to finance the original purchase price plus future expenditures and requires repayments upon sale of the constructed homes 
accordingly  the aforementioned net cash flows consider the related cash flows derived from such borrowings 
capitalization of costs 
costs capitalized include land  land development and home construction costs  real estate taxes  indirect project costs and interest related to development and construction 
we evaluate amounts recorded related to option deposits and preacquisition costs to determine whether there is an indicator for impairment 
in the cases where we decide to abandon a project because it is no longer probable that the company will continue with the project  costs previously capitalized are written off as such costs will not provide any future benefits 
in addition  decreases in development activity may result in a portion of capitalized costs being expensed 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 annually in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable  management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the related reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows 
these cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to current and future economic conditions  including absorption rates and margins reflective of slowing demand  as well as anticipated future demand 
the amounts included in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on management s best estimate of future results 
discount rates were based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for business risks 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 
additionally  future changes in any of these factors could result in future impairments of the remaining goodwill which could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate income taxes 
estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  the adjustments would be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations and liquidity

r share based payment  revised 
sfas r was effective for the company commencing july  sfas r  among other things  eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the fair value based method in sfas r is similar to the fair value based method in sfas in most respects  subject to certain key differences 
as the company previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas prospectively for all stock awards granted  commencing on july   the impact of the modified prospective adoption of sfas r did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
for stock options  the company amortizes compensation expense on a graded basis over the vesting period of each option grant 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the value of each option granted which forms the basis for the compensation expense to be recorded associated with stock options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
the company s principal market risk exposure continues to be interest rate risk 
a majority of the company s debt is variable based on libor  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on current operations  an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in cost of sales and interest charges incurred by the company of approximately  in a fiscal year  a portion of which will be capitalized and included in cost of sales as homes are delivered 
the company believes that reasonably possible near term interest rate changes will not result in a material negative effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
our subordinated notes are fixed rate debt and therefore changes in interest rates generally will affect the fair value of these debt instruments
