analysis of operating results net income monarch reported net income of  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively 
the basic and diluted earnings per share were and for december   and and  respectively  for the year ended december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average common shareholders equity 
the company s returns on average assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average shareholders equity were  and for the same time periods 
despite the decline in net income for  the company continued to realize record performance in several areas 
net interest income for the year increased  or compared to  in  which was an increase of  or over the total of  margin compression due to declining rates in the th quarter of partially offset the significant growth in interest earning assets during the year 
this compression represents a shift in the rate environment that had existed in both and when rates were on the rise 
non interest income grew or  to  compared to  in and  in mortgage income increased  or to  over the total of  which was almost level with the total of  and was the primary contributor to non interest income growth and is representative of the company s expansion of its mortgage division  monarch mortgage 
investment and insurance income increased  to  approximately times the and income of  and  respectively 
this growth is attributable to a full year of production activity from virginia asset group  llc a majority owned subsidiary of monarch investment  llc 
the sale leaseback of our lynnhaven banking office in virginia beach contributed  to pre tax non interest income in continued deposit growth resulted in a or  increase in deposit related service charges for a total of  compared to  in and  in non interest expenses associated with company expansion increased  or for a total of  compared to  in and  in the majority of the increases were in salaries  benefits and occupancy expenses related to mortgage expansion 
the net effect on pre tax income was a decrease of  or  to  when compared to  in  which had increased  or  over the pre tax income of  in net interest income net interest income  the company s primary source of revenue  is the excess of interest income over interest expense 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings on tax exempt assets  such as bank owned life insurance boli and municipal securities and loans 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on boli  tax exempt securities and loans to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
net interest income growth in is attributable to increased volume  while growth is attributable to increased volume coupled with higher rates 
declining rates in the later part of along with changes in product mix resulted in slower growth and a decline in net interest margin 
the trends for are notably different from when rates climbed early in the year then stabilized  which coupled with volume resulted in stronger net interest income growth and a higher net interest margin 
net interest income increased or  in to  when compared to  in which had increased over the total of  the company purchased boli in the amount of  in october the tax exempt income from this transaction is included in earning assets  further enhancing net interest margin and spread 
the company s balance sheet is asset sensitive with a majority of the company s earning assets set to reprice within a one year time frame  with many of the loans repricing on a daily basis based on market indexes 
this presented a challenge in when the federal reserve decreased the target funds rate basis points between september and december 
interest earning assets repriced more rapidly than interest bearing deposits which represent of total interest bearing liabilities  creating a timing difference between declines in interest earnings and cost 
prior to  the federal reserve had been increasing the target federal funds rate 
the increase in the target federal funds rate and the related effect on the prime lending rate and us treasury security rates had a positive impact on net interest income in both and the wall street journal prime rate has moved in tandem with the changes in the federal funds rate 
a majority of the loan portfolio is tied to the wall street journal prime rate  with of all loans repricing due to maturity or contractual repricing to the prime rate or another market index in the fully tax equivalent adjusted net interest margin is the primary measure used in evaluating the effectiveness of the management of earning assets and the liabilities funding those assets 
the yield on interest earning assets increased to in compared to in and in funding costs on interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings were in  in  and in the net yield on earning assets was in  in  and in table depicts interest income on average earning assets and related yields  as well as interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid for the periods indicated 
table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense  and distinguishes between the changes related to increases or decreases in average outstanding balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume  and the changes related to increases or decreases in average interest rates on such assets and liabilities rate 
net interest income was  in  an increase of  over total interest and fees on loans increased to  the increase in interest and fees on loans  the major contributor to interest income  was due to significant loan growth 
interest income from all other interest earning assets declined as funds from maturing assets were redeployed to the higher yielding loans 
interest expense on deposits increased or  to  in the company moved its focus to funding asset growth through certificates of deposits as competition from the stock market drew on money market account balances 
in addition  growth in non interest bearing checking accounts slowed in the area of escrow accounts due to the decline in the housing market 
the company s interest expense on short term borrowings increased  or when compared to during  net interest income was  an increase of  or compared to total interest and fees on loans increased to  and interest on investments increased to  the increase in interest and fees on loans  the major contributor to interest income  was due to rising rates coupled with growth in rate sensitive balances 
interest expense on deposits for increased to  as the company focused on offering attractive rates for money market accounts as part of a growth funding strategy 
the increase in non interest bearing checking accounts in the deposit mix also contributed to the improved net interest margin in the company s interest expense on short term borrowings increased  or when compared to total interest income growth significantly outpaced interest expense further benefiting net interest income 
in july  the company issued trust preferred subordinated debt in the amount of  which is included in short term borrowings 
interest on the trust preferred subordinated debt is calculated on a libor indexed rate  which adjusts  and is payable  quarterly

table changes in net interest income rate volume analysis net interest income is the product of the volume of average earning assets and the average rates earned  less the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the average rates paid 
the portion of change relating to both rate and volume is allocated to each of the rate and volume changes based on the relative change in each category 
the following table analyzes the changes in both rate and volume components of net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the past two years in thousands vs vs interest increase decrease change attributable to interest increase decrease change attributable to rate volume rate volume interest income loans commercial mortgage consumer total loans securities us government federal agencies mortgage backed state and municipal other securities total securities deposits in other banks bank owned life insurance total interest income interest expense deposits demand money market savings time total deposits other borrowings and repurchase agreements total interest expense net interest income market risk management in as with  management spent a great deal of time focusing on the management of the balance sheet to maximize net interest income 
the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
the company s primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility is to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of the company s earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on the company s earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
the company also considers the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects the company s assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated in thousands 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of the company s position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of the company s interest sensitivity position 
as illustrated in the table  monarch is asset sensitive  primarily due to its adjustable rate loan portfolio 
the majority of these loans is indexed to the wall street journal prime rate and can adjust either daily or monthly 
to match this  the company has also kept the maturities of most of its borrowings short  either maturing or repricing within one month 
the company also attempts to match longer term assets with certificates of deposit with terms of three to five years 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis months or less months to year year to years years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold securities loans bank owned life insurance total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities now and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis  alco uses more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of  and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve months 
alco also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on mve by discounting future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up and down  and on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
the projected changes in net interest income and mve to changes in interest rates at december   were in compliance with established policy guidelines 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that the company s net interest income would rise if rates increase and fall if rates decline 
the simulation analysis presents a more accurate picture since certain rate indices that affect liabilities do not change with the same magnitude over the same period of time as changes in the prime rate or other indices that reprice loans and investment securities 
the projected changes in net interest income at december   were outside of compliance of established policy guidelines in the and scenarios but were compliant in the scenarios 
the company s asset sensitivity  noted previously  coupled with the steep decline in wall street prime have resulted in mismatched funding that results in shorter term noncompliance 
management continues to focus on compliance through the tightening of lending guidelines and the establishment of floors for certain products 
table change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity change in interest rates changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up down down down the bank s simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc

non interest income non interest income totaled  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
this represents a increase of or  over compared to a or  increase from to the major components of non interest income in were mortgage banking revenue  investment and insurance commissions  service charges on deposits and a gain on the sale of assets 
this compares to and when the major income contributors were mortgage banking revenue  service charges on deposit accounts  earnings on bank owned life insurance and securities gains and losses 
mortgage banking income  which represents fees from originating and selling residential mortgage loans as well as commercial mortgages  through the company s newly reorganized division  monarch mortgage and the company s subsidiary  monarch capital  llc  more than doubled between and mortgage banking income was  in compared to  in and  in the company s second quarter move to reorganize and expand its mortgage banking operations and to bring mortgage loan processing back in house has resulted in a significant increase in loan volume despite the downturn in the mortgage industry 
the number of loans closed in was compared to in and in the dollar volume closed in was  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
investment and insurance commissions grew significantly in to  when compared to  in and  in this growth is the result of a full year s operation of virginia asset group  llc vag a owned subsidiary of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  monarch investments  llc

in  service charges continued to grow with deposits 
the fees charged in connection with the company s overdraft nsf program  which allows retail clients to overdraw their accounts without the negative stigma associated with a returned check  also increased 
this program was initiated in with broad customer acceptance 
service charges on deposit accounts were  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
as noted above  the primary reason for the increase was deposit growth coupled with the company s overdraft nsf program  which began in service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically reevaluated annually to reflect current costs and competition 
in the company entered into a sale leaseback agreement on its lynnhaven banking office that resulted in a total gain of  in compliance with gaap   of that gain was deferred and will be amortized over the life of the lease 
the reportable gain of  has been included in non interest income for there were no security gains or losses included in income for securities losses of  in and  in were due to the sale of lower yielding investment securities 
in management sold mortgage backed securities that were lower yielding 
in management sold its low yielding  tax exempt municipal securities 
other income totaled  in   in and  in the company purchased  in bank owned life insurance in october that resulted in income and commissions of  in   in and  in additionally  in other income included a one time gain from early repayment on a federal home loan bank borrowing in the amount of  non interest expense non interest expense for was  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
non interest expense includes salaries  health insurance and other employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  loan origination expenses  data processing expenses  virginia state franchise taxes and other expenses 
in all periods presented  the majority of the increase in expense growth was due to increased staffing and higher benefits costs 
total salaries and benefits expense for was  or higher than the total of  salaries and benefits for increased or  over  in in  expansion in mortgage operations as well as increases related to two additional banking offices  additional lenders and support staffing has more than doubled the number of company employees 
continued organic growth  in the form of additional banking office staffing  commercial lenders and operational support staff has been the source of salaries and benefits increases in all years presented 
in addition  higher production related incentives  and higher health insurance costs and other benefits such as social security taxes  medicare taxes  and k contribution expenses have contributed to the increase 
occupancy plus furniture and fixture expense increased or  in for a total of  compared to the total of  occupancy plus furniture and fixture expense increased or  over the total of  in  the company opened a banking office in virginia beach  opened a banking office in kitty hawk  nc  and added six mortgage offices  two in virginia beach and four in maryland

in addition  the company had a full year of expense in and for the offices added during and  respectively 
loan origination expenses increased to  or in  compared to  in the increase was over expenses of  these expenses relate to both mortgage operations and bank related lending activities 
loan origination expenses increase with growth in loan volume 
in a larger portion of the increase can be tied to the substantial growth in the number of loans originated by the company s mortgage division 
data processing increased to  in compared to  in  which was higher than the expense of  many of the company s data processing costs are based on the number of accounts serviced and the volume of transactions processed by its service providers 
these costs rose as the number of deposit accounts and loans increased 
advertising expense decreased in with the hiring of an in house marketing person  which moved some marketing expense to salaries and benefits 
advertising expense increased over as the company focused on a branding marketing campaign 
virginia franchise tax  which is based on a bank s capital  decreased in due to how this expense is accrued 
higher taxes in were related to increases in capital with the issuance of trust preferred subordinated debt and in due to the sale of additional equity capital 
management continues to focus on controlling overhead expenses in relation to income growth 
the efficiency ratio  a productivity measure used to determine how well non interest expense is managed  was in  compared to  in  and in the bank only efficiency ratio was in  compared to in  and in a lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense efficiency 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and non interest income

government and its agencies and in other high grade fixed income securities to minimize credit risk 
the securities portfolio plays a role in the management of interest rate sensitivity and generates additional interest income 
in addition  the portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used to meet collateral requirements 
the securities portfolio consists of two components  securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
securities are classified as held to maturity based on management s intent and the company s ability  at the time of purchase  to hold such securities to maturity 
these securities are carried at amortized cost

the company s management has responsibility for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by the board of directors 
among other factors  the committee on a quarterly basis considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans and the company s risk rating based loan watch list  and national and local economic conditions 
the economy of the company s trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the sum of these elements is management s recommended level for the allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  external audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
the company has developed a methodology to determine an allowance to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans  historical loss experience  peer bank loss experience  delinquency trends  economic conditions  portfolio composition  and specific loss estimates for loans considered substandard or doubtful 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
based on management s evaluation  estimated loan loss allowances are assigned to the individual loans which present a greater risk of loan loss 
if necessary  reserves would be allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow 
any reserves for impaired loans are measured based on the present rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
a composite allowance factor that considers the company s and other peer bank loss experience ratios  delinquency trends  economic conditions  and portfolio composition are applied to the total of commercial and commercial real estate loans not specifically evaluated 
the remaining loan loss allowance is allocated to the remaining loans on an overall portfolio basis based on industry and or historical loss experience 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage loans  and home equity loans are not individually reviewed and are generally risk graded at the same levels 
the risk grade and reserves are established for each homogenous pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs from a current trend in delinquencies  losses or historical experience and general economic conditions 
the company has no material delinquencies in these types of loans  and has not  since inception  had a trend or an indication of a trend that would guide the company in expected material losses in these types of homogenous pools of loans

the company maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a quarterly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of net loans were and at december  and december   respectively

interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
the company offers individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money market  and certificate of deposits 
table presents the average balances of deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits for the past two years in thousands 
prior to expansion of the company s earning assets was based largely on the growth of deposits from individuals and small and medium size businesses 
with the change in economic conditions  competition for such deposits coupled with significant asset growth has made it necessary for management to seek the alternative funding source of brokered certificates of deposits 
although purchased in large denomination bundles  the source of these deposits is in denominations of  or less  providing a balance of stability and flexibility to management 
the mix of the deposit base time deposits versus demand  money market and savings is constantly changing due to the company s needs and market conditions 
during the market for money market accounts and demand deposits slowed resulting in only a  increase in average outstanding demand deposits and a  decrease in average outstanding money market account balances 
average balances in time deposits increased  interest bearing demand deposits increased  and savings declined  changes in the stock market provided stiff competition for money market accounts which hampered growth 
the company opted to seek a greater number of out of market brokered products which allowed for more flexibility in pricing and timing of maturities in addition to offering more competitively priced for short term certificates of deposits 
certificates of deposit of  or more are detailed in table more information on deposits is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
table deposits average balance average rate average balance average rate demand deposits non interest bearing demand deposits interest bearing money market savings time table certificates of deposits certificates of deposit as of december  and in amounts of  or more were classified by maturity as follows in thousands months or less over through months over through months over months liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through short term borrowings 
liquidity is provided from cash and amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks  repayments from loans  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank and four correspondent banks  and maturing investments 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets  and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet clients credit needs 
management also takes into account any liquidity needs generated by off balance sheet transactions such as commitments to extend credit  commitments to purchase securities and standby letters of credit 
management monitors and plans the company s liquidity position for future periods 
liquidity strategies are implemented and monitored by the company s asset liability committee alco 
the committee uses a simulation and budget model to assess current and future liquidity needs 
cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold totaled million as of december   down million from the year ended december  at december   cash  securities classified as available for sale and federal funds sold were million or of total earning assets  compared to million or of total earning assets at december  additional sources of liquidity available to the company include the capacity to borrow additional funds through several established arrangements 
further information on borrowings is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
in the course of operations  due to fluctuations in loan and deposit levels  the company occasionally finds it necessary to purchase federal funds on a short term basis 
the company maintains unsecured federal funds line arrangements with four other banks  whereby it may purchase funds totaling  these lines mature and reprice daily 
at both december  and  the company had no fed funds purchased 
the company also has access to the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window should a liquidity crisis occur 
the company has not used this facility in the past and considers it a backup source of funds 
the company is a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and as such  may borrow funds under a line of credit based on criteria established by the fhlb 
this line of credit would allow the company to borrow up to of assets  or approximately  if collateralized  as of december  the company currently pledges loans and investment securities to secure this line 
blanket liens pledged on certain designated loan portfolios amounted to million at december  and million at december  additionally  investment securities with carrying values of million at december  and million at december  were pledged to secure any borrowings 
based on pledged collateral the company had a line of million at december  this line was reduced by million  which has been pledged as collateral for public deposits 
should the company ever desire to increase the line of credit beyond the limit  the fhlb would allow borrowings of up to of total assets once the company meets specific eligibility criteria 
the company had  of fhlb borrowings outstanding on december  and  outstanding as of december  the company had  in daily rate borrowings which reprice daily and  in three fixed term advance contracts outstanding on december  the first advance  which was used to match fund several amortizing longer term fixed rate loans  matures on september  and bears interest of at december  the second advance matures on november   bears a fixed interest rate of and has a one time conversion feature that allows the company the option of a one time conversion to a variable rate instrument on november  the third advance matures on november   bears a fixed interest rate of and has a one time conversion feature that allows the company the option of a one time conversion to a variable rate instrument on may  on december   the company purchased a fhlb discount notes totaling  which matured on january  the company borrowed  from the fhlb to fund this transaction 
this transaction is designed to reduce virginia bank capital taxes by increasing the company s total investment in qualified us government agency securities at the end of each quarter to increase its investment securities that are not subject to taxation by the commonwealth of virginia 
the company is not subject to state income tax but is subject to virginia franchise tax  which is calculated on its capital level  less certain deductions 
one deduction is the average balances of bonds that are not subject to taxation by the commonwealth of virginia  primarily fhlb bonds 
the company has found that it can save more in taxes than it pays in net interest expense 
before the end of each calendar quarter  the company purchases fhlb discount notes that mature soon after the quarter end 
the proceeds from the maturity of the discount note are used to repay any borrowings 
the company only enters into this type of agreement near the end of the quarter since that is the period used in the franchise tax calculation 
this borrowing makes the company appear to be borrowing a higher level of funding than what is needed for normal operations 
capital resources the adequacy of the company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to the size  composition  and quality of the company s resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses 
on july   the company issued trust preferred subordinated notes in the amount of  through a private transaction 
these notes  which are non dilutive to common stock  may be included in tier i capital for regulatory capital determination purposes 
the notes have a libor indexed rate which adjusts  and is payable  quarterly 
the interest rate at december  was 
the notes may be redeemed at par beginning on september  this capital was used for general corporate purposes in supporting company growth 
on april   the company announced an offering of a minimum of  shares and a maximum of  shares of common stock at a pre established price of per share 
the offering ran until may  with the full  shares sold 
the number of shares issued and outstanding increased to  from  with the completion of this offering 
this capital was used for general corporate purposes to support the continued growth of the company 
the federal reserve  the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance bank have adopted capital guidelines to supplement the existing definitions of capital for regulatory purposes and to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
at december   the required minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets was  of which must be tier one capital 
tier capital includes stockholders equity  retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less certain goodwill items 
at december   monarch s total risk based capital ratio was  which is well above the regulatory minimum of 
further information on capital adequacy for the company may be found in note of monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
all share and per share amounts are retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend and splits 
off balance sheet transactions the company enters into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off balance sheet transactions 
the off balance sheet transactions recognized as of december  were a line of credit to secure public funds and commitments to extent credit and standby letters of credit only 
the company does not have any off balance sheet subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
the line of credit to secure public funds was from the federal home loan bank 
this line was for  at december  and commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december   which represent legally binding agreements to lend to clients with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
at december  and december   the company had million and million respectively  in outstanding standby letters of credit 
the company does not have any off balance sheet subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
there were no commitments to purchase securities at december  or december  the company and its subsidiaries have eighteen non cancellable leases for premises

recent accounting and regulatory pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this statement amends statements no 
and by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  clarifying which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of statement no 
 establishing a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  clarifying that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and amending statement no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
the statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends statement no 
with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
it requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time an obligation is undertaken to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  and requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
the statement permits the choice between the amortization method and the fair value measurement method for the subsequent measurement of the servicing assets or liabilities  and allows for a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities at initial adoption 
the statement also requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position  and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which provides guidance on the measurement  recognition  and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
fin prescribes that a tax position should only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
a tax position that meets this threshold is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not greater than percent realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
fin was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
while the statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in addition  the statement establishes a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
lastly  sfas no 
requires additional disclosures for each interim and annual period separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and also establishes fair presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which replaces sfas  business combinations 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree as well as the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of sfas r on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment to arb no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes expanded disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning a december  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies there were no changes to the company s critical accounting policies in critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  though not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company does not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
the company s critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report on form k 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted fas statement no 
r share based payment  fas r to account for stock based compensation 
fas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of income 
prior to december   the company accounted for its stock compensation plan under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
non gaap presentations the management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
the company  in referring to its net income  is referring to income under generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
management feels the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap  is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on the company s balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management feels that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and the company s ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the company 
in this capacity  the alco committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
the alco committee uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while the alco committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling twelve month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to the alco committee policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a  and basis point bp upward or downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis and market value of portfolio equity sensitivity as of december  all of the market value of portfolio equity sensitivity results met the approved policy limits of the asset liability management policy 
the and basis point shifts in the net interest income sensitivity results were outside the approved limits 
these results are due to the short term mismatching of maturities between assets and liabilities due to the steep decline in rates as they relate to the company s asset sensitive portfolio 
management continues to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 
change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity change in interest rates changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up down down down the bank s simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc 
represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the current rate environment 
represents the difference between market value of portfolio equity in the current interest rate environment 
at the end of  the company s interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
in the company s balance sheet grew by million 
deposit inflows  primarily in the form of short term certificates of deposits  along with federal home loan structured debt have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolio 
overall  the company continues to have moderate interest rate risks to both falling and rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  the company could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the company could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the alco committee might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
