item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity during the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three year period ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
we reclassified certain items in our consolidated financial statements of prior years to conform to our current year s presentation 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing  particularly in item a 
risk factors 
introduction istar financial inc is a leading publicly traded finance company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we primarily provide custom tailored financing to high end private and corporate owners of real estate  including senior and mezzanine real estate debt  senior and mezzanine corporate capital  corporate net lease financing and equity 
our company  which is taxed as a real estate investment trust reit  seeks to deliver strong dividends and superior risk adjusted returns on equity to shareholders by providing innovative and value added financing solutions to our customers 
our two primary lines of business are lending and corporate tenant leasing 
the lending business is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from million to million and have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
these loans may be either fixed rate based on the us treasury rate plus a spread or variable rate based on libor plus a spread and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of the borrowers 
we also provide senior and subordinated capital to corporations  particularly those engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses 
these financings may be either secured or unsecured  typically range in size from million to million and have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
as part of the lending business  we also acquire whole loans and loan participations which present attractive risk reward opportunities 
our corporate tenant leasing business provides capital to corporations and other owners who control facilities leased to single creditworthy customers 
our net leased assets are generally mission critical headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long term leases with public companies  many of which are rated corporate credits  and many of which provide for most expenses at the facility to be paid by the corporate customer on a triple net lease basis 
corporate tenant lease  or ctl  transactions have initial terms generally ranging from to years and typically range in size from million to million 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that our borrowers pay on our loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that our corporate customers pay us to lease our ctl properties 
a smaller and more variable source of revenue is other income  which consists primarily of prepayment penalties and realized gains that occur when our borrowers repay their loans before the maturity date 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from our loans and leases and our interest expense and the cost of our ctl operations 
we generally seek to match fund our revenue generating assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on our earnings 
we began our business in through private investment funds 
in  we converted our organizational form to a maryland corporation and replaced our former dual class common share structure with a single class of common stock 
our common stock common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on november  prior to this date  our common stock was traded on the american stock exchange 
since that time  we have grown through the origination of new lending and leasing transactions  as well as through corporate acquisitions  including the acquisition of trinet corporate realty trust  inc in  the acquisition of falcon financial investment trust  the acquisition of a significant non controlling interest in oak hill advisors  lp and affiliates in and the acquisition of the commercial real estate lending business of fremont investment and loan  a division of fremont general corporation  in economic trends over the past several years  the commercial real estate industry has experienced increasing property level operating returns 
during this period  the industry attracted large amounts of investment capital which led to increased property valuations across most sectors 
investors such as pension funds and foreign buyers increased their allocations to real estate and private real estate funds and individual investors raised record amounts of capital to invest in the sector 
at the same time  interest rates remained at historically low levels and the yield curve  or the difference between short term and long term interest rates  flattened or inverted 
lower interest rates enabled many property owners to finance their assets at attractive rates and proceeds levels 
default rates on commercial mortgages steadily declined over the past ten years 
as a result  many banks and insurance companies increased their real estate lending activities 
the securitization markets for commercial real estate  including both the commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and the collateralized debt obligation cdo markets  experienced record issuance volumes and liquidity 
investors in this arena were willing to buy increasingly complex and aggressively underwritten transactions and commercial real estate valuations increased at a faster pace than underlying cash flows due to the large supply of investor capital 
during the second half of  the global economy was impacted by the deterioration of the us subprime residential mortgage market and the weakening of the u 
s housing markets  both of which have become worse than many economists had predicted 
the decline in home sales that began in continued into and represented the first year over year decline in nationwide house prices since the subprime mortgage industry began to collapse in early  as borrowers became unable or unwilling to make payments 
the significant increase in foreclosure activity and rising interest rates in mid depressed housing prices further as problems in the subprime markets spread to the near prime and prime mortgage markets 
the well publicized problems in the residential markets spread to other financial markets  causing corporate credit spreads or cost of funds to widen dramatically 
banks and other lending institutions started to tighten lending standards and restrict credit 
the structured credit markets  including the cmbs and cdo markets  have seized up as investors have shunned the asset class owing to subprime and transparency worries 
in particular  the short term  three to five year floating rate debt market has effectively shut down and as the turmoil continues to spread  almost all fixed income capital markets have been negatively impacted and liquidity in these markets remains severely limited 
while delinquencies in the commercial real estate markets remain quite low  the lack of liquidity in the cmbs and other commercial mortgage markets is negatively impacting sales and financing activity 
it is widely believed that if the credit crisis continues for several more quarters  commercial real estate values will be negatively impacted  as the higher cost or lack of availability of debt financing become a reality for real estate owners 
looking forward  the current high levels of us home inventories suggest that new construction activity will continue to decline 
lower housing prices combined with tighter credit conditions and increasing oil prices may slow consumer spending 
we believe these conditions will continue to strain the global capital markets  and will ultimately stress other components of the capital markets  such as commercial real estate 
in addition  the continuation of these conditions will most likely decrease the us growth rate in executive overview istar financial experienced significant growth in  primarily as a result of the discounted acquisition of the fremont commercial real estate portfolio  which we completed in early july 
at the end of  our total assets were billion  a increase over last year  we generated more than billion of revenue this year or more than in  and we now have over employees in offices throughout the country and a subsidiary in europe 
at the close of the year  we had substantially completed the integration of the fremont commercial real estate business 
in addition to the fremont acquisition  we closed separate financing commitments and funded billion on new and previously committed transactions 
including amounts on acquired fremont loans  repayments and prepayments for the year totaled billion 
the credit crisis  which began in earnest in mid  has significantly impacted corporate credit spreads  increasing our cost of funds and limiting our access to the unsecured debt markets our primary source of debt financing 
the current financial turmoil has also started to impact our borrowers ability to service their debt and refinance their loans as they mature 
in addition  a large percentage of the fremont portfolio is residential condominium construction loans 
some of these borrowers are experiencing a slow down in residential sales due to falling home prices and reduced availability in the single family mortgage market 
the proceeds from residential condominium sales are generally used to repay principal on our loans 
our results of operations for were impacted by the credit crisis  with net income allocable to common shareholders of million and diluted earnings per common share of both lower than we anticipated 
it has also had a negative impact on the value of several of our investments 
during the fourth quarter  we took a million non cash impairment charge on two of our credits accounted for as held to maturity debt securities that have traded well below our carrying value 
in addition  based on increased risks in our loan portfolio including those associated with the fremont acquired loans  as well as the deterioration in economic and financial conditions  we had provisions for loan losses of million during the year  versus million in and million in with the addition of the fremont portfolio  we had material increases in our watch list and non performing loans 
our total loss coverage  defined as the combination of loan loss reserves and the remaining purchase discount on the acquisition  was million or of total loans  at the end of the year 
the impairments and additional loan loss reserves negatively impacted our return on common book equity and our adjusted return on common book equity this year 
key performance measures we use the following metrics to measure our profitability adjusted diluted eps  calculated as adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 
see section captioned adjusted earnings for more information on this metric 
net finance margin  calculated as the rate of return on assets less the cost of debt 
the rate of return on assets is the sum of interest income and operating lease income  divided by the sum of the average book value of gross corporate tenant lease assets  loans and other lending investments  purchased intangibles and assets held for sale over the period 
the cost of debt is the sum of interest expense and operating costs for corporate tenant lease assets  divided by the average book value of gross debt obligations during the period 
return on average common book equity  calculated as net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
adjusted return on average common book equity  calculated as adjusted basic earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
the following table summarizes these key metrics for the years ended december  adjusted diluted eps net finance margin return on average common book equity adjusted return on average common book equity explanatory note included in adjusted diluted eps and return and adjusted return on average common book equity for the year ended december  is a million non cash charge associated with the impairment of two held to maturity investment securities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
for the years ended december   and  operating lease income used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  interest expense used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of  and for the years ended december   and  operating costs corporate tenant lease assets used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  net finance margin for includes non cash ctl impairment charges of million 
excluding these charges  the net finance margin would have been 
net finance margin for includes the amortization of the fremont loan purchase discount of million 
excluding these charges  the net finance margin would have been for the year ended december  the following is an overview of the significant factors that impacted our key performance measures and profitability as well as how those items were affected by key trends 
asset growth reflects our ability to originate new loans and leases and grow our asset base in a prudent manner 
during the year ended december   we generated billion of transaction volume representing financing commitments not including the fremont acquisition 
the majority of this transaction volume occurred in the first half of the year  prior to the advent of the credit crisis 
transaction volume for the years ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
we completed and financing commitments in and  respectively 
based upon feedback from our customers  we believe that greater name recognition  our reputation for completing highly structured transactions in an efficient manner and the service level we provide to our customers have contributed to increases in transaction volume 
we have also experienced significant growth during the last several years through a number of strategic acquisitions which complemented our organic growth and extended our business franchise 
in mid  we acquired the commercial real estate lending business of fremont general see more detailed description of the transaction below 
the fremont acquisition was a major component of our growth in  in terms of both additional loan assets and new employees and offices 
the benefits of higher investment volumes have been mitigated to an extent by the low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years 
low interest rates benefit us in that our borrowing costs decrease  but similarly  earnings on our variable rate lending investments also decrease 
the increased investment and lending activity in both the public and private commercial real estate markets  as described under economic trends  has resulted in a highly competitive real estate financing environment with reduced returns on assets 
during the later part of  as the credit crisis took hold  the real estate financing markets came to a stand still  with little or no transaction volume 
most banks and other commercial real estate lenders had significant inventories of loans on their balance sheets that could not be sold or securitized  as mark to market values were difficult to obtain 
while base interest rates remain very low  the margin  or spread on new debt transactions has widened dramatically  however there is still very little new transaction volume 
over the past several years  while property level fundamentals have been stable or improving  investment activity in direct real estate ownership has increased dramatically 
in many cases  this has caused property valuations to increase disproportionately to any corresponding increase in fundamentals 
corporate tenant leases  or net leased properties  are one of the most stable real estate asset classes and have garnered significant interest from both institutional and retail investors who seek long term  stable income streams 
in many cases  we believe that ctl transactions in today s market do not represent compelling risk adjusted returns 
as a result  we have not invested as heavily in this asset class  acquiring only million in  million in and million in while we continue to monitor the ctl market and review certain transactions  we have shifted most of our origination resources to our lending business until we see compelling opportunities for ctl acquisitions in the market again 
risk management reflects our ability to underwrite and manage our loans and leases to balance income production potential with the potential for credit losses 
as an on balance sheet lender  we endeavor to manage our business to ensure that the overall credit quality of the portfolio remains strong 
this year some of our businesses were negatively impacted by the credit crisis  including our loan and securities portfolio 
in addition  as part of the discounted acquisition of the fremont portfolio  we acquired a pool of loan assets that had a higher probability of default and loss 
as a result of these factors  the credit statistics in our loan and securities portfolio have declined in at december  our non performing loan assets represented of total assets versus in we charged off million against the reserve for loan losses in and provisioned million of additional reserves of which million was identified as asset specific 
at december  our total loss coverage  defined as the combination of total loan loss reserves and the remaining purchase discount associated with the fremont acquisition  was million  or of total loans 
we believe that we have established adequate loan loss reserves 
in addition  we took a million non cash impairment on two credits accounted for as held to maturity debt securities in our loan and securities portfolio that were trading well below our carrying value 
the weighted average duration of the loan portfolio is years 
at december  the weighted average risk rating on the ctl portfolio was down slightly from year end we continue to focus on re leasing space at our ctl facilities under longer term leases in an effort to reduce the impact of lease expirations on our earnings 
as of december   the weighted average lease term on our ctl portfolio was years and the portfolio was leased 
we expect the average lease term of our portfolio to decline somewhat until such time that we begin to find new acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria 
cost and availability of funds reflects our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates and terms and insulate our margin from changes in interest rates 
in  we began migrating our debt obligations from secured debt to unsecured debt 
we believed that funding ourselves on an unsecured basis would enable us to better serve our customers  more effectively match fund our assets and provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in october of  in part as a result of our shift to unsecured debt  our senior unsecured debt ratings were upgraded to investment grade bbb baa by s p and moody s 
this resulted in a broader market for our bonds and a lower cost of debt 
in  we continued to broaden our sources of capital  particularly in the unsecured bank and bond markets 
we completed billion in bond offerings  upsized our unsecured credit facility to billion and eliminated three secured lines of credit 
we also repaid our million of stars asset backed notes  which resulted in the recognition of a million early extinguishment charge 
we lowered our percentage of secured debt to total debt to at the end of from at the end of in  as a result of our continued strong operating performance and our low levels of secured debt  s p  moody s and fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb  baa  and bbb from bbb  baa and bbb  respectively 
during  we completed billion of bond offerings and completed an exchange offer on our highest rate corporate bonds 
in addition  we upsized our unsecured credit facility to billion and amended the facility to allow us to borrow british pounds  euros and canadian dollars to better enable us to invest outside the united states 
this capability enabled us to more effectively match fund our foreign investments 
prior to the onset of the credit crisis in mid  we continued to access the unsecured debt markets  raising billion in new bond transactions 
we also increased our unsecured revolving credit capacity through the addition of a new five year facility with a maximum capacity of billion  bringing our total unsecured revolving credit capacity to billion as of december  also on june   we closed on a billion short term interim financing facility in order to fund the fremont acquisition 
in the later half of the year  as the credit crisis took hold and became increasingly pervasive  our corporate spreads  or our cost of unsecured debt capital  increased dramatically and our access to the unsecured debt markets was limited 
in october  we successfully accessed the convertible bond market with a million offering of notes priced with a coupon of libor basis points and a conversion premium of to our then current stock price 
in december  we issued million shares of common stock for approximately million of net proceeds 
in addition  as the short term  three to five year floating rate markets remain virtually closed  we are less able to match fund our assets and liabilities from both a maturity and fixed floating rate perspective 
we expect our increased cost of funds to impact our returns in during the last quarter of the year  we began to put several secured financing initiatives in place to tap our largely unencumbered asset base 
we expect the rates that we will achieve on these secured financings will be substantially more attractive than our unsecured financing alternatives for the forseeable future 
we expect these secured financings to be completed in the second quarter of we seek to match fund our assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that rising interest rates or changes in the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on our earnings 
our policy requires that we manage our fixed floating rate exposure such that a basis point increase in short term interest rates would have no more than a impact on our quarterly adjusted earnings 
at december   a basis point increase in libor would result in a increase in our fourth quarter adjusted earnings 
we have used fixed rate or floating rate hedges to manage our fixed and floating rate exposure 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign exchange rates or forward curves will have a minimal impact on earnings 
foreign denominated assets and liabilities are presented in our financial statements in us dollars at current exchange rates each reporting period with changes flowing through earnings 
matched assets and liabilities in the same currency are a natural hedge against currency fluctuations 
for investments denominated in currencies other than british pounds  canadian dollars and euros  we primarily use forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
in addition  funds are available from repayments and prepayments on existing loans and sales of select assets 
expense management reflects our ability to maintain a customer oriented and cost effective operation 
we measure the efficiency of our operations by tracking our expense ratio  which is the ratio of general and administrative expenses to total revenue 
our expense ratio was and for and  respectively 
the increase in reflects increases in payroll costs  expenses associated with employee growth including additional office space costs  expenses associated with the fremont acquisition and ramp up of one of our european ventures 
management talent is one of our most significant assets and our payroll costs are correspondingly our largest non interest cash expense 
we expect to monitor the size and depth of our employee base and make adjustments based upon market conditions and opportunities 
we believe that our expense ratio remains low by industry standards 
capital management reflects our ability to maintain a strong capital base through the use of prudent financial leverage 
we use an asset based capital allocation model to derive our maximum targeted corporate leverage 
we calculate our leverage as the ratio of book debt to the sum of book equity  accumulated depreciation  accumulated depletion and loan loss reserves 
our leverage was x  x and x in  and  respectively 
in  when we went public  our leverage levels were very low  around x 
since that time we have been slowly increasing our leverage to our targeted levels 
we evaluate our capital model target leverage levels based upon leverage levels achieved for similar assets in other markets  market liquidity levels for underlying assets and default and severity experience 
we measure our capital management by the strength of our tangible capital base and the ratio of our tangible book equity to total book assets 
our tangible book equity was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our ratio of tangible book equity to total book assets was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the decline in this ratio is attributable to a modest increase in financial leverage as we have moved towards our target capital level 
we believe that relative to other finance companies  we are well capitalized for a company of our size and asset base 
fremont acquisition on july   we acquired the commercial real estate lending business and billion commercial real estate loan portfolio  which we refer to as fremont cre  from fremont investment loan  or fremont  a subsidiary of fremont general corporation  pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement dated may  concurrently  we completed the sale of a billion participation interest in the same loan portfolio to fremont  pursuant to a definitive loan participation agreement dated july  the net cash purchase price of billion was funded with proceeds from borrowings under an interim financing facility obtained by us  which bears interest at libor 
fremont s commercial real estate business  which was one of its two primary reportable segments  originated commercial first mortgage loans  which are principally bridge and construction loan facilities  out of nine field offices 
under the terms of the loan participation agreement  as of the date of acquisition  we were responsible for funding approximately billion of existing unfunded loan commitments associated with the portfolio over the next several years 
the balance of unfunded commitments required to be funded was billion as of december  fremont will receive of all principal collected from the purchased loan portfolio  including the portions of loans funded solely by istar  until the billion principal amount of fremont s loan participation interest is repaid 
the participation interest pays floating interest at libor and we accounted for the issuance of the participation as a sale 
we accounted for the business combination under the purchase method 
under the purchase method  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the following table shows the fair values  as of the date of the acquisition  of the assets purchased  liabilities assumed and participation interest sold in the transaction with fremont in thousands loan principal  loan discount  net  loan participation interest sold  accrued interest  other assets  intangible assets  goodwill  other liabilities  net assets acquired  subsequent events on february   we announced that one of our timber investments  timberstar southwest  has entered into an agreement to sell approximately  acres of timberland for approximately billion 
timberstar southwest is a joint venture between our subsidiary timberstar and equity investors msd capital  york capital management and perry capital 
timberstar southwest purchased the properties from international paper for approximately billion in october once completed  we expect to receive approximately million of net proceeds from the sale

change interest income    operating lease income    other income    total revenue    the increase in total revenue during was primarily due to increased interest income 
interest income from the acquired fremont portfolio contributed million to the increase in this amount included million from the amortization of purchase discount on the acquired loans 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to a billion increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and other lending investments during excluding the acquired loan portfolio 
the average rate of return on our loans and lending investments increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to higher average yields on the acquired fremont loans that resulted from purchasing the loans at a discount 
during  our operating lease income grew by million which was attributable to new ctl investments  offset by million of lower operating lease income due to terminated leases  vacancies and lower rental rates on certain ctl assets 
other income was million higher in than in  primarily resulting from an increase in prepayment penalties  partially offset by decreases in income from timber operations and income from other investments 
the increase in revenue from to was primarily due to increased interest income 
higher interest income during resulted primarily from a billion increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and other lending investments 
interest income was also higher due to a higher average rate of return on our loans and lending investments  which increased to in  from in the increased rate of return was primarily attributable to our variable rate lending investments which reset at higher rates during when the average one month libor rate was compared to in during  our operating lease income grew by million which was attributable to new ctl investments  offset by million of lower operating lease income due to vacancies and lower rental rates on certain ctl assets 
other income was million lower in than in this decline resulted from a decrease in prepayment penalties and gains on marketable securities  partially offset by increases in lease termination fees  income from timber operations  and income from other investments 
interest expense for the years ended december  v 
change v 
change interest expense    interest expense increased from to primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during  partially offset by decreased interest rates on our borrowings 
our average outstanding debt balance increased to billion in from billion in through new bond issuances early in  as well as  through increased borrowings on both our existing and our new unsecured revolving credit facilities 
in addition  we financed the fremont acquisition with proceeds from an interim financing facility and then subsequently repaid a portion of that balance with proceeds from a convertible bond issuance and equity issuance in the fourth quarter of weighted average interest rates on our outstanding debt decreased to in as compared to in this decrease is attributable to increased borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facilities and our interim financing facility in which bear interest at libor and libor  respectively 
interest expense increased from to due mostly to an increase in average outstanding borrowings during and an increase in our weighted average interest rates 
our average outstanding debt balance grew to billion in as compared to billion in mostly through billion of new bond issuances and million increased borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facilities  specifically borrowings in foreign currencies 
weighted average interest rates increased to in from in primarily due to higher one month libor rates on our borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facilities

change v 
change operating costs corporate tenant lease assets   depreciation and amortization    general and administrative    provision for loan losses    loss on early extinguishment of debt  other expense  total other costs and expenses    total other costs and expenses increased by approximately million from to due to significant increases in various line items including provision for loan losses  other expense  for which their were no comparable amounts in  and general and administrative costs 
the million increase in our provision for loan losses was attributed both to the addition of asset specific reserves as well as negative trends in the overall economy  growth in our historical portfolio and our newly acquired loan portfolio  as further described in the risk management section 
other expense includes a million impairment recorded on two credits that are accounted for as held to maturity securities as determined based on our assessment that the decline in value for these securities was other than temporary  as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
also included in other expense is a million impairment recorded on a strategic equity investment and the net ineffectiveness of our interest rate swaps  as further described in the hedging section 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million from to due to a number of contributing factors 
our payroll and payroll related costs increased by approximately million resulting from the overall headcount growth  including million of payroll and payroll related costs attributed to the employees hired as part of the fremont acquisition 
excluding payroll related costs  the fremont acquisition added another million to our general and administrative expense  of which million represented one time costs and integration expenses 
stock based compensation also increased by approximately million in as compared to  primarily related to new restricted stock units granted in  partially offset by the one time hpu compensation charge taken in see below for further details 
additionally  included in is million of management and start up fees associated with the ramp up of one of our european ventures in other factors contributing to the remaining increase in general and administrative costs include higher tax expense for trs entities  primarily related to our oak hill joint venture income  abandoned pursuit costs and legal fees 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from to  marginally contributing to the overall increase in total costs and expenses 
this increase relates primarily to the acquisitions and improvements of ctl assets in total other costs and expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to due to various offsetting factors 
increases in general and administrative costs  provision for loan losses and operating costs corporate tenant lease assets  were significantly offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt recorded in during  general and administrative expenses increased by million  primarily due to an increase in employee growth and ramp up of new business initiatives 
also in  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in connection with our high performance unit equity compensation program for senior management 
the non cash compensation charge was the result of a correction due to a change in assumptions for the liquidity  non voting and forfeiture discounts used in valuing the hpu securities issued in the seven plans offered since the commencement of the program in see note stock based compensation plans and employee benefits on our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the cumulative charge was recorded during  rather than restating prior periods  because we concluded that the expense was not material to any of our previously issued financial statements for any period 
we increased our provision for loan losses to million in from million in primarily due to our risk rating process and the increase in the size of our loan portfolio 
operating costs for corporate tenant lease assets increased by million from to primarily related to new ctl investments and higher unrecoverable operating costs due to vacancies 
during  we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt related to the early repayment of our stars  series notes and series notes and a million term loan 
there were no such losses in other components of net income earnings from equity method investments earnings from equity method investments increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase of million in income from our oak hill investments and an increase of from our ctc investment 
ctc sold its remaining investment property to a third party investor resulting in a net gain  of which our share was million 
we also realized a million deferred gain that was carried as a basis difference in our investment in ctc which was the result of the capitalized interest from previous construction financing to the venture 
increases in income from other strategic investments totaling million were mostly offset by million of increased losses from timberstar southwest 
our million share of losses from timberstar southwest in included our million share of depreciation  depletion and amortization from the venture 
earnings from equity method investments increased to million in from million in mostly due to an increase in income from our investments in oak hill 
discontinued operations we sold eight  ten and five ctl assets and realized gains of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represent net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  ineffectiveness on interest rate hedges  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect our share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
we believe that adjusted earnings is a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income  because this measure helps us to evaluate how our commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation  depletion and amortization  which are typically non cash charges 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate and corporate lending and corporate tenant leasing  we record significant depreciation on our real estate assets and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our borrowings 
we also record depletion on our timber assets 
depreciation  depletion and amortization do not affect our daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
by measuring our performance using adjusted earnings and net income  we are able to evaluate how our business is performing both before and after giving effect to recurring gaap adjustments such as depreciation  depletion and amortization including earnings from joint venture interests on the same basis and excluding gains or losses from the sale of assets that will no longer be part of continuing operations 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
rather  we believe that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps us analyze how our business is performing 
this measure is also used to track compliance with covenants in certain of our material borrowing arrangements that have covenants based upon this measure 
adjusted earnings should not be viewed as an alternative measure of either our operating liquidity or funds available for our cash needs or for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may not calculate adjusted earnings in the same manner as other companies that use a similarly titled measure

included in adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders for the year ended december  is a million non cash charge associated with the impairment of two held to maturity securities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
in addition to the gaap defined weighted average diluted shares outstanding these balances include an additional  shares   shares and  shares for the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to the additional dilution of joint venture shares 
there were no additional shares included for the years ended december  and  relating to the dilution of joint venture shares 
the decrease in adjusted earnings from to is driven primarily by the decrease in our net income as explained in the results of operations section above 
offsetting that decrease are increases in certain non cash charges that are added back to net income to arrive at adjusted earnings 
specifically  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million from to as described above in results of operations 
additionally  joint venture depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million primarily due to our share of depletion recorded by the timberstar southwest venture which was formed in the fourth quarter of risk management loan credit statistics the table below summarizes our non performing loans and details the reserve for loan losses associated with our loans in thousands as of december  as of december  non performing loans carrying value   participated portion  gross loan value   as a percentage of total assets as a percentage of total loans watch list loans carrying value   participated portion  gross loan value   reserve for loan losses   as a percentage of total loans other real estate owned carrying value  non performing loans all non performing loans are placed on non accrual status and income is recognized only upon actual cash receipt 
we designate loans as non performing at such time as management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts towards  curing the cause of an impairment  the loan becomes days delinquent  the loan has a maturity default  or the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value of such loan 
as of december   we had non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of million and an aggregate gross loan value of billion  or of total assets 
management believes there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the book values of the loans 
included in non performing loans are acquired loans that were deemed to be impaired on the date of acquisition and recorded at fair value in accordance with sop these sop loans have a current book value million below our share of unpaid principal 
in addition  there are other acquired loans included in non performing loans that have a total of million of unamortized purchase discount 
amortization of purchased discount is suspended when loans are placed on non accrual status 
watch list assets we conduct a quarterly comprehensive credit review  resulting in an individual risk rating being assigned to each asset 
this review is designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively manage asset specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio wide basis as an early warning system 
as of december   we had assets on the credit watch list  excluding those assets included in non performing loans above  with an aggregate carrying value of billion and an aggregate gross loan value of billion  or of total assets 
reserve for loan losses during the year ended december   we added million to the reserve for loan losses  which was the result of million of provisioning for loan losses reduced by million of charge offs 
the reserve is generally increased through the provision for loan losses  which reduces income in the period recorded and reduced through actual charge offs 
the reserve for loan losses includes an asset specific component and a formula based component 
at the end of  we had million of asset specific reserves related to non performing loans 
a reserve is established for a non performing loan when the estimated fair value of the loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
all of our non performing loans were tested for impairment as of december  the formula based general reserve was million on december  during the year we have increased reserves on our historical portfolio to reflect the continued deterioration in the overall credit markets and its impact on our portfolio 
reserves have also been provisioned for growth in the portfolio and for newly funded commitments in the recently acquired loan portfolio 
adjustments to this reserve are based on management s evaluation of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk ratings system  industry loss experience  the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  the credit quality of the underlying collateral and changes in the size of the loan portfolio 
other real estate owned oreo during the year ended december   we acquired by foreclosure  or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  four properties valued at million 
the carrying value of the loans that these properties collateralized prior to our taking title was million 
the transfer of these assets from loans to oreo resulted in million in charge offs against the reserve for loan losses 
gross loan value gross loan value is computed by adding istar s carrying value of the loan and the portion of the loan that is owned by fremont through the loan participation agreement 
it represents what the carrying value of the loan would have been if the loan participation had not occurred 
under the terms of the participation  fremont will receive of all loan principal payments  including principal that istar has funded 
therefore  istar is in the first loss position 
as such  management believes that presentation of the gross loan value is more relevant than a presentation of istar s carrying value when assuming istar s risk of loss on the loans in the fremont cre portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources we require significant capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses 
while the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital committed to our operations  we believe we have sufficient access to capital resources to fund our existing business plan  which includes our real estate and corporate lending and corporate tenant leasing businesses 
our capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under lines of credit  additional term borrowings  unsecured corporate debt financing  financings secured by our assets  trust preferred debt  and the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
further  we may acquire other businesses or assets using our capital stock  cash or a combination thereof 
over the next several years  we have unfunded commitments related to our loans totaling billion 
we expect to fund approximately billion of this amount in in addition  we have debt maturities of billion in  including billion outstanding on an interim facility which matures on june  recently  liquidity in the capital markets has been constrained  increasing our cost of funds and limiting our access to the unsecured debt markets our primary source of debt financing 
as a result  during the last quarter of the year  we began to put several secured financing initiatives in place to tap our largely unencumbered asset base 
we expect the rates that we will achieve on these secured financings will be substantially more attractive than our unsecured financing alternatives for the foreseeable future 
the company expects to complete these secured financings in the second quarter of we expect these proceeds  as well as amounts available under our unsecured and secured credit facilities  amounts we receive from repayments of our existing loan assets and proceeds we receive from certain asset sales  including the sale of our timberstar southwest venture  will be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs 
however  we will continue to assess the market and consider raising additional liquidity through the issuance of unsecured debt or equity  at a higher cost of funds than our secured financing alternatives  if necessary 
our ability to meet our short and long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors  such as our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  our credit rating  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
during the last quarter of the year  we began to put several secured financing initiatives in place to tap our largely unencumbered asset base 
we expect these secured financings to be completed in the following table outlines the contractual obligations related to our long term debt agreements and operating lease obligations as of december  we have no other long term liabilities that would constitute a contractual obligation

we also have a million letter of credit outstanding as security for our primary corporate office lease 
we also have letters of credit outstanding totaling million as additional collateral for three of our investments 
see off balance sheet transactions below  for a discussion of certain unfunded commitments related to our lending and ctl business 
unsecured secured credit facilities our primary source of short term funds is an aggregate of billion of available credit under our two committed unsecured revolving credit facilities  which includes the amended billion facility  maturing in june  as well as a billion facility  maturing in june  entered into during the second quarter of  as described further below 
as of december   there was approximately million which was immediately available to draw under these facilities at our discretion 
in addition  we have a million secured revolving credit facility for which availability is based on percentage borrowing base calculations 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the secured credit facility as of december  on june   we completed an unsecured revolving credit facility with leading financial institutions having a maximum capacity of billion 
commitments under this facility will mature in june borrowings under this credit agreement  which may be made in multiple currencies  bear interest at a floating rate based upon one of several base rates which vary depending upon the currency of the borrowing  plus a margin which adjusts upward or downward based upon our corporate credit rating 
on june   we also amended and restated our billion revolving credit agreement to conform various covenants and provisions to those in the new billion revolving credit agreement and to increase the commitment to billion  of which million can be borrowed in multiple foreign currencies 
this agreement had been previously amended and restated in june to increase the commitment from billion to billion 
also as part of this amendment  the interest rate decreased to libor  the facility fee decreased to basis points and the maturity was extended to june also on june   we closed on a billion short term interim financing facility in order to fund the fremont acquisition see note for further detail 
on july   in connection with the closing of the fremont transaction we drew billion under this facility  of which billion remained outstanding  bearing interest at three month libor  as of december  our million secured credit facility was amended and restated on september  to extend the maturity from january to september  and to remove the one year term out extension 
capital markets activity during the year ended december   we issued million and million aggregate principal amounts of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates of and and maturing in and  respectively  and million of variable rate senior notes bearing interest at three month libor maturing in we primarily used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to repay outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in connection with this issuance  we settled forward starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million and ten year terms matching that of the million senior notes due in we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap the fixed interest rate on the million senior notes due in for a variable interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on all hedging activity 
in addition  on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior floating rate notes due convertible notes 
the convertible notes were issued at par  mature on october   and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to month libor plus 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness 
we used million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the interim financing facility which we used to fund the fremont acquisition 
we used the balance of the net proceeds to repay other outstanding indebtedness 
the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holders  into approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes  on or after august   or prior to that date if the price of our common stock trades above for a specified duration  the trading price of the convertible notes is below a certain threshold  subject to specified exceptions  the convertible notes have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions have occurred 
none of the conversion triggers have been met as of december  the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
if the conditions for conversion are met  we may choose to pay in cash and or common stock  however  if this occurs  we have the intent and ability to settle this debt in cash 
accordingly  there was no impact on our diluted earnings per share for any of the periods presented 
we have evaluated the terms of the call feature  redemption feature  and the conversion feature under applicable accounting literature  including sfas and eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and concluded that none of these features should be separately accounted for as derivatives 
in november  we repurchased million of the original million of libor senior notes maturing in in addition  our million of libor senior notes matured in march on january   in connection with a consent solicitation of the holders of the respective notes  we amended certain covenants in our senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  and senior notes due collectively  the modified notes 
holders of approximately of the aggregate principal amount of the modified notes consented to the solicitation 
the purpose of the amendments was to conform most of the covenants to the covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes issued by us since we achieved an investment grade rating from s p  moody s and fitch 
in connection with the consent solicitation we paid an aggregate fee of million to the consenting note holders  which will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the modified notes 
in addition  we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating million  which were recorded as expenses and included in general and administrative on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates ranging from to and maturing between and and million of variable rate senior notes bearing interest at three month libor maturing in we primarily used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to repay outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  our million of senior notes matured in may on october   we exchanged our senior notes due for senior notes due in accordance with the exchange offer and consent solicitation launched on september  for each  principal amount of senior notes tendered  holders received approximately  principal amount of senior notes and of cash 
a total of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were issued as part of the exchange 
we also amended certain covenants in the indenture relating to the remaining senior notes due as a result of a consent solicitation of the holders of these notes 
other financing activity our term financing that is collateralized by corporate bonds matured on august  and has been extended consecutively  with varying interest rates  through december  and further through march  the carrying value of corporate bonds collateralizing the borrowing totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  on may   we began a loan participation program which serves as an alternative to borrowing funds from our revolving credit facilities 
the loan participations are short term bank loans funded in the secondary market with fixed maturity dates typically ranging from overnight to days 
there were no amounts outstanding under this program at december  or we did not incur any loss on early extinguishment of debt during the years ended december  and during the year ended december   we incurred an aggregate net loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million as a result of the early retirement of certain debt obligations 
debt covenants our debt obligations and credit facilities contain covenants that are both financial and non financial in nature 
significant financial covenants include limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness beyond specified levels and a requirement to maintain specified ratios of unsecured indebtedness compared to unencumbered assets and minimum net worth 
based on our current credit ratings  the financial covenants in some series of our publicly held debt securities are not operative 
significant non financial covenants include a requirement in some series of our publicly held debt securities that we offer to repurchase those securities at a premium if we undergo a change of control 
our unsecured credit facility and interim financing facility agreements contain a covenant that limits us from paying common dividends in excess of the greater of of adjusted earnings and such amounts as are necessary to maintain reit status 
although to maintain reit status  we are required to pay out of ordinary taxable income  we paid out dividends equal to of taxable income  as is the typical reit practice as corporate income taxes are required to be paid on undistributed taxable income 
as a result of a non cash impairment charge of million and an increased provision for loan losses see note for further details that significantly reduced our adjusted earnings for the year ended december   but not our taxable income  we were not in compliance with this covenant 
however  we received a waiver for this covenant covering the year ended december  we also amended our unsecured revolving credit facilities and interim financing facility to allow us to pay out of taxable earnings 
other than as noted above  as of december   we believe we are in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants on our debt obligations 
unencumbered assets unsecured debt the following table shows the ratio of our unencumbered assets to unsecured debt at december  and in thousands as of december  total unencumbered assets   total unsecured debt   unencumbered assets unsecured debt explanatory note see note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our unsecured debt 
during the last quarter of  we began to put several secured financing initiatives in place to tap our largely unencumbered asset base 
we expect the rates that we will achieve on these secured financings will be substantially more attractive than our unsecured financing alternatives for the foreseeable future 
hedging activities we have variable rate lending assets and variable rate debt obligations 
these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that as interest rates increase  we earn more on our variable rate lending assets and pay more on our variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  we earn less on our variable rate lending assets and pay less on our variable rate debt obligations 
when the amount of our variable rate debt obligations exceeds the amount of our variable rate lending assets  we use derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on our net income 
we have a policy in place  that is administered by the audit committee  which requires us to enter into hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on our earnings 
the policy states that a basis point increase in short term rates cannot have a greater than impact on quarterly earnings 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the derivative instruments we use are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps effectively can either convert variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations or convert fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate payable on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition  we also use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
the primary risks related to our use of derivative instruments are the risks that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that we may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if we terminate a hedging arrangement 
as a matter of policy  we enter into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a a by s p and moody s  respectively 
our hedging strategy is approved and monitored by our audit committee on behalf of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors without shareholder approval

during  we recorded a net gain of million in other expense on our consolidated statements of operations  due to ineffectiveness on fair value hedges 
during the year ended december   we recorded a cumulative non cash out of period charge of million to reflect a cumulative reduction in the fair value of three interest rate swaps which we determined did not qualify for hedge accounting within the meaning of sfas no 
we recorded the charge in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december   rather than restating prior periods 
the charge reflects a cumulative loss in the fair value of the swaps from the time they were entered into through june  and is recorded as an increase to debt obligations and other expense on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations  respectively 
the application of hedge accounting generally requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedging relationships on an ongoing basis and to calculate the changes in fair value of our hedging instruments and related hedged items independently 
this is known as the long haul method of hedge accounting 
transactions that meet more stringent criteria may qualify for the short cut method of hedge accounting in which an assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item exactly offsets the change in value of the related derivative 
we determined that we incorrectly applied the short cut method of hedge accounting to three interest rate swaps which the we entered into in in connection with our issuance of fixed rate debt securities 
since the swaps were incorrectly designated as qualifying for short cut hedge accounting  and we did not test the hedging relationships periodically for effectiveness  the provisions of sfas no 
do not allow us to retroactively apply the long haul method  although the swaps would have qualified for long haul hedge accounting treatment if they had been documented that way at their inception 
we have concluded that the cumulative loss is not material to any of our previously issued financial statements for any period 
recording the cumulative charge in any year from through  would have impacted net income by or less 
further  we have concluded that the cumulative loss is not material to the current fiscal year 
this charge was recorded in other expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we redesignated all of our fair value swaps in september to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the long haul method as prescribed by sfas no 
any net ineffectiveness will be recorded in other expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
off balance sheet transactions we are not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
we have several investments in unconsolidated entities that have outstanding debt  all of which is non recourse to us 
as part of the acquisition of falcon financial  we obtained falcon financial s residual interests and servicing obligations related to four off balance sheet loan securitizations 
our ongoing relationship with these special purpose entities is not material to our operations 
we have certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to our loans and other lending investments that we may be required to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which we have sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those that we are generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of our direct control 
as of december   we had loans with unfunded commitments totaling billion  of which billion was discretionary and billion was non discretionary 
in addition  million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to ten ctl investments 
these commitments generally fall into two categories pre approved capital improvement projects  and new or additional construction costs 
upon completion of the improvements or construction  we would receive additional operating lease income from the customers 
in addition  we have million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to existing customers in the form of tenant improvements which were negotiated between the company and the customers at the commencement of the leases 
further  we had equity investments with unfunded non discretionary commitments of million 
ratings triggers the two commited unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating billion that we had in place at december   bear interest at libor per annum based on our senior unsecured credit ratings of bbb from s p  baa from moody s and bbb from fitch ratings 
our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facilities is not dependent on our credit ratings 
based on our current senior unsecured debt ratings by s p  moody s and fitch  the financial covenants in most series of our publicly held debt securities  including limitations on incurrence of indebtedness and maintenance of unencumbered assets compared to unsecured indebtedness  are not operative 
if we were to be downgraded from our current ratings by two of these three rating agencies  these financial covenants would become operative again 
however  as of december   we would be in full compliance with these covenants if they were operative 
except as described above  there are no other ratings triggers in any of our debt instruments or other operating or financial agreements at december  transactions with related parties during  we invested in a substantial minority interest of oak hill advisors  lp  oak hill credit alpha mgp  ohsf gp partners ii  llc  oak hill credit opportunities mgp  llc  in  ohsf gp partners  llc and in  oha finance mgp  llc and oha capital solutions mgp  llc see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
in relation to our investment in these entities  we appointed to our board of directors a member that holds a substantial investment in these same seven entities 
as of december   the carrying value in these ventures was million 
earnings from these investments were million for the year ended december  we have also invested in eight funds managed by oak hill advisors  lp  which have a carrying value of million as of december  we recorded earnings of million from these investments during on november   istar acquisition corp  or iac filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to a million initial public offering 
iac is a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring  through a business combination  one or more operating businesses  or a portion of such business or businesses 
to date  this filing has not yet become effective and our efforts have been limited solely to organizational activities 
there can be no assurance that the offering will be consummated 
on november  iac issued  units  each unit consisting of one share of iac s common stock and one iac common stock purchase warrant  to us and to mr 
sugarman  iac s chairman and the chairman and chief executive officer of istar 
each party purchased half of the outstanding units for an aggregate of  in cash  at an average purchase price of approximately per unit 
on december   istar and mr 
sugarman transferred units  at the original cost of per unit  to mr 
nydick  istar s president  and a group of istar s senior executives 
after giving effect to these transfers and anticipated transfers of initial units to independent directors  istar and mr 
sugarman will maintain ownership of equal amounts of initial units 
iac issued a  unsecured promissory note to us and a  unsecured promissory note to mr 
sugarman on november  the notes are non interest bearing and are payable on the earlier of the consummation of the public offering or november  iac s financial statements have been consolidated by istar and are included in our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as such  we have eliminated the inter company debt  but have a  liability to mr 
sugarman and have reflected minority interests in iac related to units owned by mr 
sugarman  mr 
nydick and the group of istar senior executives with ownership interests 
we anticipate that if the public offering is completed  the financial statements of iac will no longer be consolidated and our investment will be accounted for under the equity method 
drip stock purchase plans we maintain a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
under the dividend reinvestment component of the plan  our shareholders may purchase additional shares of common stock without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges by automatically reinvesting all or a portion of their common stock cash dividends 
under the direct stock purchase component of the plan  our shareholders and new investors may purchase shares of common stock directly from us without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges 
all purchases of shares in excess of  per month pursuant to the direct purchase component are at our sole discretion 
shares issued under the plan may reflect a discount of up to from the prevailing market price of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to million shares of common stock pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plans 
during the years ended december   and  we issued a total of approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  through the plans 
net proceeds for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
there are approximately million shares available for issuance under the plan as of december  stock repurchase program in november  the board of directors approved  and we implemented  a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to million shares of common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets or loan repayments and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under our credit facilities if we determine that it is advantageous to do so 
there is no fixed expiration date to this plan 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock for a cost of approximately million at an average cost per share of 
prior to  we had not repurchased any shares under the stock repurchase program since november as of december   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we have also issued approximately million shares of treasury stock during see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods  including any judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  reviewed and applied consistently from period to period 
we base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and  therefore  routinely require adjustment 
during  management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments reserve for loan losses the company maintains a reserve for loan losses at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the reserve is increased through the provision for credit losses  which impacts operating results  and decreased by the amount of charge offs  net of recoveries 
our determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  all of which may be susceptible to significant change  including  among others expected default probabilities  loss given default  exposure at default  amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  changes in economic conditions  and potential estimation or judgmental imprecision 
the reserve for loan losses includes a formula based component and an asset specific component 
the formula based reserve component covers performing loans and is the product of the probability of default and loss given default based primarily on internal loan risk ratings 
loss factors are based on industry and or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  based on our judgment  impact the collectibility of the loans as of the balance sheet date 
the asset specific reserve component relates to provisions for losses on loans considered impaired and measured pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairments of a loan  sfas 
a reserve is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
all of our non performing loans or npls are evaluated individually 
we determine the fair value of the collateral using one or more valuation techniques  such as property appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analyses or replacement cost comparisons 
determination of the fair value of collateral  by any of these techniques  requires significant judgment and discretion by management 
if we determine that a loan is impaired  either a specific reserve is created or the loan  or a portion thereof  is charged off through the reserve for loan losses 
our loan impairment testing resulted in the recognition of specific reserves of million during and charge offs of million during there were no loan impairments or specific reserves recognized during long lived assets impairment test we test our long lived assets for impairment  which are primarily our ctl assets to be held and used  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
for this test  recoverability is determined by the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the determination of projected cash flows and eventual sales prices of our long lived assets requires significant judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain 
goodwill impairment test goodwill is not amortized  instead it is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
there are two parts to the goodwill impairment analysis 
the first part of the test is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
the second test requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets less liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment 
there were no impairment charges recognized during  or related to goodwill 
fair value of derivatives we have historically used derivatives to help manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as assets or liabilities 
fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument depends on the availability and reliability of relevant market data  such as quoted market prices 
financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or readily available market data require minimal judgment in determining fair value 
when observable market prices and data are not readily available or do not exist  we estimate the fair value using market data and model based interpolations using standard models that are widely accepted within the industry 
market data includes prices of instruments with similar maturities and characteristics  duration  interest rate yield curves and measures of volatility 
derivative assets were million and derivatives liabilities were million on december   compared with derivative assets of million and derivatives liabilities of million on december  consolidation variable interest entities we are a party to a number of off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
we consolidate certain entities in which we own less than a equity interest if we determine that we have a controlling interest or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie as defined in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
there is a significant amount of judgment required in interpreting the provisions of fin r and applying them to specific transactions 
in order to determine if an entity is considered a vie  we first perform a qualitative analysis  which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment  including  but not limited to  the nature and structure of the entity  the variability of the economic interests that the entity passes along to its interest holders  the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement 
an iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a vie or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations  requires that the acquired assets and liabilities  including contingencies  be recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in revenue  not goodwill  changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs  and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred 
adoption of sfas r is required for combinations after december  early adoption and retroactive application of sfas r to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted

 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the exchange price notion in the fair value definition to mean the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability an exit price  not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price 
this statement also clarifies that market participant assumptions should include assumptions about risk  should include assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and should reflect its nonperformance risk the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled 
nonperformance risk should include the reporting entity s credit risk

in july  the fasb released interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information

sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets 
sfas no 
was issued to simplify the accounting for servicing rights and to reduce the volatility that results from the use of different measurement attributes for servicing rights and the related financial instruments used to economically hedge risks associated with those servicing rights 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting for servicing rights by clarifying when a separate asset or servicing liability should be recognized  requiring a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability to be measured at fair value  allowing entities to subsequently measure servicing rights either at fair value or under the amortization method for each class of a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability  permitting a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities  and requiring separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value 
sfas no

 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
the key provisions of sfas no 
include a broad fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest only strips ios and principal only strips pos from derivative accounting under paragraph of sfas no 
thereby narrowing such exception  a requirement that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  clarification that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and elimination of the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity qspe holding passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing our business plan  the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with our liability management objectives  we have implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on our interest bearing assets  which we may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of our interest bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of our interest earning assets if borrowers refinance our loans 
approximately of our loan investments are subject to prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to us 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while we generally seek to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  we could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risks in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us which adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  we employ match funding based financing and hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce our exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in credit risk of our borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between us and a third party the counterparty 
when we purchase a cap or floor contract  we make an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to us in the future should the reference rate typically one  three or six month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  we will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  we will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
we utilize the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
our swaps are either pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from us or pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from us  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  we would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  we would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating non qualifying income  use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non qualified income for reit income test purposes 
this includes hedging asset related risks such as credit  foreign exchange and prepayment or interest rate exposure on our loan assets 
as a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited 
there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
we are potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract we enter into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease or basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and earnings from equity method investments  less interest expense  operating costs on ctl assets and loss on early extinguishment of debt  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect to interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with our assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
many of our loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties  yield maintenance fees or contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
net fair value of financial instruments in the table below does not include ctl assets approximately of total assets and certain forms of corporate finance investments but includes debt associated with the financing of these assets 
therefore  the table below is not a meaningful representation of the estimated percentage change in net fair value of financial instruments with change in interest rates 
the estimated percentage change in net investment income does include operating lease income from ctl assets and therefore is a more accurate representation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net investment income 
estimated percentage change in change in interest rates net investment income net fair value of financial instruments basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points explanatory note net investment income increases with decreases in interest rates due interest rate floors on certain assets that become effective in the current low interest rate environment 
the estimated net fair value of financial instruments under the base interest rate was million 
a and basis point increase in interest rates would increase the estimated net fair values of the financial instruments to million and million  respectively 
a and basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the estimated net fair values of the financial instruments to million and million  respectively
