item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data in item and amounts herein have been restated  as applicable  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item safe harbor statement under section e of the securities exchange act of the statements in this form k that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  among other things  statements that relate to west marine s future plans  expectations  objectives  performance and similar projections  as well as facts and assumptions underlying these statements or projections 
these forward looking statements  which are included in accordance with the provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of  may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by the forward looking statements in this report 
although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from these expectations 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed under risk factors in item a of this report 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are based only upon information available as of the date of this report 
we do not undertake  and specifically disclaim any obligation  to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
restatement subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements  management determined  after a detailed review of workers compensation claims and historical reserves  that we had made an error in the manner in which we had established and recorded our self insured reserves for estimated workers compensation claims 
this error prompted a review of other reserves and accounts  particularly those involving management estimates 
as a result of this review  in addition to the workers compensation liability adjustment  we also identified additional adjustments to our quarterly and prior period financial statements relating to  among other things  inventory reserves  vendor allowances  capitalized indirect costs  sales and use tax accruals  sales return reserves  software development costs  software asset impairments  foreign currency translation gains losses  deferred income taxes  and stock based compensation 
we also identified certain items incorrectly presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of cash flows  including changes in merchandise inventories  repayments and borrowings on our credit facility  and the non cash portion of fixed assets purchases 
we also identified errors in our segment information disclosure  as required information regarding assets  capital expenditures and depreciation for our reportable segments was incorrectly excluded 
further  we identified errors 
table of contents in the presentation of certain accrued expenses in our financial statement footnotes 
as a result  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and december  in this report and restated quarterly financial data for fiscal year and the first three quarters of fiscal year we will also file an amended quarterly report on form q a for each of the first three quarters of reflecting these adjustments 
for more information  see note to our consolidated finance statements in item of this report 
overview net loss for was million  including a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill 
this compares to a net loss for of million  including a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
net sales were million in  compared to million in we achieved annual operating cash flow of million in our debt to capital ratio decreased to at year end  compared to at year end merchandise inventories at year end decreased by million  or  compared to year end comparable store sales for decreased 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores that have been open at least months and where selling square footage did not change by more than in the previous months 
we continue to focus on key initiatives designed to position the company for sustained  long term growth and profitability 
we remain committed to controlling our expense structure 
in  we plan to close more stores than we plan to open 
however  due to store relocations to larger sites  expansions of existing locations and efforts toward real estate optimization  overall store square footage is expected to remain the same or grow slightly 
we plan to continue our focus on broad  targeted merchandise assortments in order to grow our stores  direct sales and port supply businesses while continuing to improve inventory productivity 
we intend to manage expenses with discipline and invest where we expect a return 
in this regard  we intend to accommodate any future sales growth by investing in information technology systems to improve our supply chain efficiencies rather than building new or expanding current distribution center facilities 
we concluded that goodwill carried on the balance sheet was impaired as of december  we annually test goodwill for impairment in july or more frequently if evidence of possible impairment arises 
as part of this testing  management compared fair value to the underlying carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
in light of fourth quarter changes in cash flow expectations  market values of guideline companies and other factors used for impairment testing  west marine re tested goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of its net assets exceeded fair value 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of million is reflected in our fiscal year results 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 

table of contents management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the average cost or market value 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory at december   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory shrinkage reserve we make certain assumptions based upon historical experience and current information to adjust inventory value for estimated physical inventory losses  or shrinkage 
our reserve for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on historical shrinkage rates as determined by our physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts 
our reserve for shrinkage losses included in ending inventory at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
our inventory shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including historical results and current inventory loss trends 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our inventory shrinkage reserve during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store selling locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the adequacy of the procedures of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
vendor allowances receivable we establish a receivable and reduce inventory cost for income generated from vendor sponsored programs  or vendor allowances  that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level for the vendor allowances receivable 
our receivable for vendor allowances at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  which is included in other current assets 
our vendor allowances receivable contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and in interim periods requires management to estimate future inventory purchases 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor allowances receivable during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor allowances receivable 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our estimate of our ability to collect vendor allowances at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in  a million charge for impairment of store and computer software assets was included in selling  general and administrative expense 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill all goodwill is assigned to our stores segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information  as appropriate 
we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill of million in fiscal year there was no impairment of goodwill during fiscal year the carrying value of goodwill was nil at december  and was million at december  for more information  see note goodwill impairment loss in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
we have not made any material changes in our goodwill impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment because we had no goodwill at december  any change would be the result of future acquisitions 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions uncertain tax positions effective december   we were required to adopt and implement the provisions of fin  which establishes a new basis for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain income tax positions that have been or expect to be taken in tax returns 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized an increase in the liability for our uncertain tax positions of million  of which the entire charge was accounted for as a decrease to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the accrual for uncertain tax positions can result in a difference between the estimated benefit recorded in our financial statements and the benefit taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns 
this difference is generally referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit 
our uncertain tax positions contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to material losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent the settlement of our uncertain tax positions results in payments of amounts in excess of our fin liabilities  or reductions in deductions or other recognized tax attributes in excess of our unrecognized tax benefits  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a change in the actual settlements of our uncertain tax positions at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions deferred tax assets valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  state tax apportionment and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
accordingly  in  we determined that the our california enterprise zone credit carryforward will not be realized within a reasonable period of time  and as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million million net of federal income tax benefit against this deferred tax asset 
our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment  primarily that the company will have future taxable income  to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
we apply consistent methodologies to assess the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are reasonable  realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future taxable income 
actual results could differ  and we may be required to write off deferred tax assets in a future period if the company does not incur taxable income  and that charge could be material 
to the extent we do not incur taxable income when we file our tax returns  or pretax book income in future periods  we may be required to impose valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in federal and state jurisdictions not currently provided for 
the resulting charge from imposing a full valuation allowance against our federal net deferred tax assets would be approximately million 
the charge from imposing a valuation allowance against the remaining state jurisdictions would be approximately million 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions liabilities for self insurance or high deductible losses we are self insured for certain losses  including those related to employee healthcare 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
in other cases  we purchase commercial insurance  such as for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we insure workers compensation losses through a high deductible program  and we recognize our liability for the ultimate payment of incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses by accruing liabilities on an actuarial basis which represent estimates of future amounts necessary to pay claims and related expenses with respect to covered events that have occurred 
when estimating our liabilities relating to self insurance or high deductible insurance programs  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors and actuarial analysis 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by actuarial analysis to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
liabilities for our self insured losses or high deductible insurance programs contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
for the fourth quarter of  we corrected the approach used to determine accrued liabilities relating to our workers compensation high deductible insurance programs 
this correction resulted in a million increase in workers compensation liability at december  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a further material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insured liabilities and loss reserves relating to high deductible insurance programs at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan under which we award non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
we also have an associate stock buying plan 
for more information  see note share based compensation  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of this report 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards and associate stock buying plan purchases using similar valuation techniques and the closing market price of our common stock 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our assumptions for stock price volatility  expected term  and other assumptions which impact the black scholes fair value for calculating stock based compensation for the fiscal year ended december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense goodwill impairment store closures and other restructuring costs loss from operations interest expense loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss results of operations compared to net sales for were million  compared to net sales of million for net loss for was million  including a million pre tax  charge for goodwill impairment  compared to a net loss for of million  including a million pre tax  charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
division sales net sales for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million sales decline attributable to the closure of certain under performing stores during and a million decrease in comparable store sales additionally  sales declined million due to stores closed in and million due to our reduced participation in events outside of store locations 
partially offsetting the sales decreases was a million increase from new stores opened in port supply sales through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased sales to port supply customers through our store locations  which are included in stores sales 
net sales of our direct sales segment increased million  or  to million  due to million in increased sales from our internet website 
the increase from the internet channel was partially offset by reduced catalog sales 
comparable store sales comparable store sales decreased in by  or million 
comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were  and  respectively 
the decline in comparable store sales reflects the softer sales of higher priced discretionary items and lower in store traffic levels extending into the peak part of the boating season  which we believe is indicative of reduced boat usage 
these trends were particularly evident in florida  which is a key boating market 
we expect consumers to continue to reduce spending on boating supplies  the duration of reduced spending is difficult to predict  and we believe  is somewhat dependent on general improvements in the overall economy 
gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  a decrease of basis points compared to in gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to occupancy expense 
occupancy is our largest fixed expense and its impact on gross margin is largely driven by sales results  and while occupancy expense decreased million  or  the fixed nature of the expense deleveraged gross margin by basis points due to the year over year decline in sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million or  compared to and increased as a percentage of sales to in  a basis point increase  compared to in the full year impact of the expense reductions associated with the store closure initiative  as well as other expense controls implemented in  contributed basis points toward improved selling  general and administrative expense 
these expense improvements were partially offset by expenses of million associated with the ongoing sec investigation and million paid to our former chief executive officer as severance compensation 
goodwill impairment we updated our analysis and evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment as of december  due to fourth quarter changes in future cash flow expectations  market values of guideline companies and other factors used for impairment testing 
we re tested goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of its net assets exceeded fair value 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge related to goodwill of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as of fiscal year end  we had no goodwill on the balance sheet 
loss from operations loss from operations in was million  representing a million change when compared to a loss from operations of million in this change was primarily due to a million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower inventory levels than last year which drove reduced bank borrowings 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a benefit of in the lower benefit rate in was primarily attributable to the non deductible portion of goodwill impairment changes  which reduced tax benefits by million 
in addition  during we recorded valuation allowances against our california enterprise zone credit and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
results of operations compared to net sales for were million  compared to net sales of million for net loss for was million compared to net loss for of million 
net loss for included a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
net loss for included pre tax charges for the following  million for discontinued software development projects  million for reducing inventory value  million for discontinuing our use of an acquired tradename  and million for the unamortized portion of loan costs related to the repayment of then existing debt in connection with obtaining a new bank credit facility 
store closures and other restructuring costs on august   our board of directors approved management s recommendation to close between and stores that management identified as having no reasonable expectation of significant positive cash flow over the near term 
during  we closed stores in conjunction with this initiative and consolidated certain direct sales call center operations  incurring million in related costs 
for more information  see critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of long lived assets 

table of contents division sales net sales attributable to our stores segment increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million increase in comparable store sales 
net sales not included in comparable store sales during included million in sales from new stores and million in sales from remodeled or expanded stores  partially offset by a million sales decrease from closed locations 
port supply sales through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased sales to port supply customers through our store locations  which are included in stores sales 
net sales of our direct sales segment increased million  or  to million  primarily due to million in increased sales from our internet website  which we believe is partially offset by reduced direct sales in areas where we had opened new stores 
comparable store sales comparable store sales increased in by  or million  with an increase reported in each fiscal quarter 
comparable store sales increases during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
increased sales to port supply customers through our store locations represented an million increase in comparable store sales 
we believe that comparable store sales increased partly due to milder weather compared to gross profit gross profit increased million  or  in  compared to  due to higher sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales of was down from in an million  or basis points  change in the level of indirect costs and vendor allowances that were capitalized in inventory value in  which decreased gross profit in as the related products were sold  was more than offset by a million  or basis points  improvement in raw product margin and inventory shrinkage 
selling  general and administrative expense our future profitability is largely dependent on our ability to increase sales and gross profit while containing selling  general and administrative expense 
in  selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense decreased to of net sales in  compared to of net sales in  an improvement of basis points over the previous year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense compared to the previous year was primarily due to million  or basis points  included in selling  general and administrative expense for cancelled software development projects and discontinuing our use of an acquired tradename 
selling  general and administrative expense in was also lower by an additional million  or basis points  compared to as a result of our cost cutting initiatives implemented during these expense savings were partially offset by million  or basis points  for spending on investments in initiatives intended to improve profitability over the long term  including upgrading our internet platform  expanding our port supply marketing teams  training our store selling associates and localizing or specializing certain store merchandise assortments 
loss from operations loss from operations in was million  representing a million change when compared to net loss from operations of million in this change was primarily due to an million change in the level of indirect costs and vendor allowances that were capitalized in inventory value in  which decreased gross profit in as the related products were sold  partially offset by reduced selling  general and administrative expense in interest expense interest expense increased million  or  in  compared to  primarily due to million from higher average interest rates partially offset by million from lower average borrowings 

table of contents income taxes our effective income tax benefit rate of for compared to a benefit of in  primarily due to changes in our estimation of state income tax liabilities  which increased tax benefits in by approximately million 
in addition  during we recorded million in valuation allowances against our state net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs primarily are for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
we also may require additional capital in the event we choose to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we believe our existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs through as a result of the untimely filing of this report with the sec  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others for one year 
the inability to use form s could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period 
if we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the sec and or were to be delisted from the nasdaq global market  it could adversely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity 
however  we are still eligible to register our securities on form s operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  due to our million net loss before adjustments for a million goodwill impairment charge  million in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accrued expenses  and a million decrease in inventories 
inventory value decreased by  while inventory per square foot decreased by at the end of  compared to last year  primarily due to our focus on better overall inventory management and correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
capital growth in  we spent million on capital expenditures  mainly for store remodels  new stores and information technology 
we opened nine new stores and remodeled stores in we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures during  mainly for store development activities  including new stores  remodels and expansions  and information technology 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and bank borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million in net repayments on our line of credit  partially offset by million in cash provided by financing activities related to associate stock based compensation plans 
we have a million credit facility that expires in december borrowing availability is based on a percentage of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and certain accounts receivable 
at our option  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  our loan agreement provides up to million in additional financing during the term 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory and that of our subsidiaries  certain other assets related thereto  and all proceeds thereof 
the credit facility includes a million sub facility available for the issuance of commercial and stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 

table of contents at our election  borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at one of the following rates the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank  national association at its principal office in san francisco  california or the interest rate per annum at which deposits in us dollars are offered by reference lenders to prime banks in designated markets located outside the united states 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving facility 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility 
for the fourth quarter of  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including but not limited to  restrictions on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to incur liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets 
additionally  minimum revolving credit availability equal to the lesser of million or of the borrowing base must be maintained

table of contents we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets

seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
management expects the seasonal fluctuation in net sales to become more pronounced as we continue to expand our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
a basis point change in the interest rate of our weighted average interest rate affecting our floating financial instruments would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
