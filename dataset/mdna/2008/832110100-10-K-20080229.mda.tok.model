item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed beginning on page company products and operations the company is a leading global provider of premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
the company provides a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services  including drilling and completion fluid systems  solids control and separation equipment  waste management services  oilfield production chemicals  three cone and diamond drill bits  turbines  borehole enlargement tools  tubulars  fishing services  drilling tools  underreamers  casing exit and multilateral systems  packers and liner hangers 
the company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive north american branch network providing pipe  valves and fittings as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products 
the company s operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production e p spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects 
although e p spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas  it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  the financial condition of independent e p companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
in addition  approximately six percent of the company s consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the us economy 
capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets  which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels 
north american drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  with approximately percent of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities 
conversely  drilling in areas outside of north america is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals  which influence over three quarters of international drilling activity 
historically  business in markets outside of north america has proved to be less volatile as the high cost e p programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies  consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan 
although percent of the company s consolidated revenues were generated in north america during  smith s profitability was largely dependent upon business levels in markets outside of north america 
the distribution segment  which accounts for percent of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a north american customer base  serves to distort the geographic revenue mix of the company s oilfield segment operations 
excluding the impact of the distribution segment  approximately percent of the company s revenues were generated in markets outside of north america 
finally  over the past few years  a number of factors have driven an increase in the importance of national oil companies nocs in the global energy industry 
nocs currently control approximately percent of world oil reserves and account for nearly three quarters of production 
as we look forward  nocs and their governments will likely have more control over the pace and the manner in which oil and gas resources are developed which could have implications for smith and other oilfield service industry participants 
we believe we have been successful developing strong business relationships with nocs  which contribute a sizable portion of our revenues 
business outlook after experiencing percent compound annual rig count growth in north america over the past five year period  north american activity levels are forecasted to remain relatively flat during the near term 
markets outside north america should continue to expand as the increased number of drilling programs in the eastern hemisphere  combined with the addition of a number of newbuild offshore rigs scheduled for delivery in and beyond  contribute to increased customer spending levels 
although a number of factors influence forecasted exploration and production spending  the company s business is highly dependent on the general economic environment in the united states and other major world economies which ultimately impacts energy consumption and the resulting demand for our products and services 
a global economic slowdown could pare energy demand and adversely impact business volumes across our operations and the future financial results of the company 

table of contents results of operations segment discussion the company markets its products and services throughout the world through four business units which are aggregated into two reportable segments 
the oilfield segment consists of three business units m i swaco  smith technologies and smith services

distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves and fittings  as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
the segment has the most significant north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations with percent of wilson s revenues generated in those markets 
moreover  approximately percent of wilson s revenues relate to sales to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the us economic environment 
additionally  certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and  accordingly  are adversely impacted by increases in crude oil and natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   wilson reported revenues of billion  percent above the fiscal year 
the revenue growth was reported by the energy operations  influenced by higher us drilling activity levels and increased line pipe project spending

net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  totaled million in net interest expense increased million from the prior year  influenced by the inclusion of certain acquisition related borrowings in the later half of 
table of contents the effective tax rate approximated percent  approximately basis points below the prior year level 
the favorable comparison to the effective rate  as well as the us statutory rate  was influenced by the higher proportion of m i swaco s us partnership earnings and lower state income tax accrual rates

the company invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds associated with certain asset disposals 
acquisition funding  which largely related to the purchase of dsi inspection services  inc and ce franklin s acquisition of jen supply ltd  resulted in cash outflows of million 
projected net capital expenditures for are forecasted to total million  relatively consistent with spending levels reported for the majority of the forecasted expenditures relate to routine additions of rental tool and manufacturing equipment to support the company s business operations and maintain the existing capital equipment base 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled million in the company s strong operating cash flow performance enabled the funding of investing activities and million of combined share repurchases and dividend payments  while still having sufficient availability to repay million of outstanding borrowings under various loan agreements 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated from operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
as of december   the company had million drawn and million of letters of credit issued under various us revolving credit facilities  resulting in million of capacity available for future operating or investing needs

management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to the company s operations 
additional acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or  depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition  may require debt or equity financing 
the company makes regular quarterly distributions under a dividend program 
on february   the company s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to per share 
the current annualized payout of approximately million is expected to be funded with cash flows from operations and  if necessary  amounts available under existing credit facilities 
the level of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the company s financial condition  earnings  cash flows  compliance with certain debt covenants and other relevant factors

future repurchases under the program may be executed from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and will be funded with cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing credit facilities 
the company believes it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  inflation has had a modest impact on the company s financial results in the three most recent fiscal years  with the company experiencing escalation in wages  transportation costs and  to some extent  petrochemical and other commodity prices during the company expects to be able to continue to offset the impact of future cost inflation through productivity gains and pricing initiatives 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities  and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios

moreover  the required disclosure related to the company s million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions has been omitted from the above table 
due to the complex application of tax regulations  combined with our inability to predict when tax audits in various jurisdictions may be concluded  the company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements  if any  related to its uncertain tax positions 
standby letters of credit in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  the company is contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid  performance and surety bonds 
certain of these outstanding instruments guarantee payment to insurance companies which reinsure certain liability coverages of the company s insurance captive

table of contents insurance the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company has elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under its insurance programs 
amounts in excess of the self insured retention levels are fully insured to limits believed appropriate for the company s operations 
self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
while management believes that amounts accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are adequate for expected liabilities arising from the company s portion of losses  estimates of these liabilities may change as circumstances develop 
litigation the company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
as of december   the company s environmental reserve totaled million 
this amount reflects the future undiscounted estimated exposure related to identified properties  without regard to indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory reserves 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market fundamentals and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 

table of contents goodwill 
the company has acquired a number of operations during the past decade  which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections 
estimating future cash flows of the company s operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
although the majority of the goodwill relates to the company s oilfield operations  million of goodwill relates to distribution transactions 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the annual analysis is performed 
self insurance 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required

if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations including the recognition and measurement of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling ownership interest purchased in a transaction 
sfas r also sets forth new guidance regarding the treatment of transaction related costs and establishes additional disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r which are effective  and will be adopted by the company  on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for subsidiaries which are not wholly owned 
under sfas  the company will be required to classify the minority interest liability reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
moreover  the company will be required to present net income attributable to the company and the minority partners ownership interest separately on the consolidated statement of operations 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas which are effective  and will be adopted by the company  on january  to determine any additional impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  and at december  and  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value was greater than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
as of december   the notional amount of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
