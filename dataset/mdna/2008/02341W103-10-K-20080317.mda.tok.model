item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  specialty minerals company and earn our revenues and profits from a diverse group of industrial and consumer product lines 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the united states  australia  china and turkey 
additionally  through our affiliates and joint ventures  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india and mexico 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which require us to identify which markets our reserves can serve 
we believe that our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are the core components of our longevity and future prospects 
we operate in five segments minerals  environmental  oilfield services  transportation and corporate 
both our minerals and environmental segments operate manufacturing facilities in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
our oilfield services segment operates principally in north america  europe and africa 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that performs trucking services for our domestic minerals and environmental businesses as well as third parties 
our customers are engaged in varied end markets and geographies 
customers in the minerals segment range from foundries that produce castings for automotive  industrial  and transportation equipment  including heavy duty trucks and railroad cars  to producers of consumer goods  including cat box filler  cosmetics and detergents 
the customers for our lining technologies and building materials products are predominantly engineering contractors 
the oilfield services customer base is primarily comprised of oil and gas service or exploration companies 
a significant portion of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our business is performed under short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
approximately of our revenue is generated in the americas 
principally north america 
consequently  the state of the us economy impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in the asia pacific and european regions  which have continued to outpace the united states in economic growth 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we employ a number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have a history of commitment to research and development and using this resource to bring innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 
globalization we have expanded our manufacturing and marketing organizations into europe and asia pacific over the last years 
this operating experience enables us to expand further into emerging markets 
we see the significant opportunities in the asia pacific region for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow 
we expect to take advantage of these growth areas either through our wholly owned subsidiaries or investments in affiliates and joint ventures 
mineral development bentonite is a component in a majority of the products we produce 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure that new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 
acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to add complementary businesses to our portfolio of products 
in  we paid net cash of million to acquire four businesses 
a strong financial position will enable us to continue to acquire businesses which  in our assessment  are valued fairly and fit with our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in general  the significance of these risks has not changed over the past year 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our financial statements are based in part upon critical accounting policies that involve complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our selection of accounting policies has resulted in actual results approximating the estimated amounts in each respective area 
these policies are discussed below and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
our process to evaluate inventories for excess or obsolete items is comprehensive 
we quantify the amount of inventory on hand that  based on projected demand  is not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  is excess or obsolete 
this involves a review by sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets we have made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and have moderate investments in goodwill and intangible assets 
our goodwill and intangible assets have resulted largely from business combinations or acquisitions that we have completed 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations when initially recognizing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition 
under these guidelines  we are required to recognize the intangible assets we acquire in a business combination 
these are typically customer related assets  trademarks and tradenames and non compete agreements 
we are required to make significant estimates as to the nature of these customer relationships including future profitability and term of the relationships 
we are also required to make significant estimates regarding the probability and impact of competition from former owners or management employees of businesses we acquire 
these estimates are critical as we make these estimates from the viewpoint of a market participant perspective and involve forecasting future results and uncertainties on behalf of the customers whom the acquired business serves 
for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment assessment at the reporting unit level or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in conducting our impairment tests and in testing the recoverability of long lived assets as well as property  plant and equipment  we use models that use estimates of cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  discount rates that reflect the related business risks  and appropriate perpetuity or disposal values 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of these assets should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
our estimates related to the carrying values of these assets are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our united states employees hired on or before december  in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  we must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with our actuaries 
to determine our net accrued benefit and net periodic benefit cost  we form judgments about the best estimate for each assumption used in the actuarial computation 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield of a standardized benchmark  the moody s aa corporate bond index  which consists of high quality fixed income investments  and round it to the nearest basis points 
the discount rate used to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at september   was 
a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation at september  by million and would increase net cost expected in by  or thousand 
likewise at september   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by million and would decrease the net cost expected in by  or thousand 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the historical long term performance  as adjusted for existing market conditions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
we assumed a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of to determine our net benefit cost in a basis point decrease in the expected return would increase the net cost expected in by approximately  or thousand 
likewise  a basis point increase in the expected return would decrease the net cost expected in by thousand 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we account for our tax positions in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions 
our estimates of income tax items  expense and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
valuation allowances are recorded  if necessary  to measure a deferred tax asset at an estimated realizable value 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
changes in a valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we determine events have occurred that will impact the realizable value of the asset 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our united states federal income tax returns have been completed for our income tax returns relating to fiscal years of and prior 
state income tax returns are audited more infrequently 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recording of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution
