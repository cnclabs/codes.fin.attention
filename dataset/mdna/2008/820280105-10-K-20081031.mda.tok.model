item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with part i of this form k as well as our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the following analysis contains forward looking statements about our future revenues  operating results and expectations 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as part i  item a risk factors 
overview fiscal year was a mixed year with record revenues  operating income and operating cash flow 
however  our operating income was lower than as we had originally anticipated at the beginning of our fiscal year primarily due to the recognition of greater than expected costs on a significant power project recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  the financial crisis that adversely impacted us equity markets throughout  weighed heavily on the share prices of many engineering and construction companies  including ours 
at the time of this filing  it is uncertain what impact the financial credit crisis may ultimately have on our business which is substantially dependent on our clients ability to access significant and now substantially constrained debt and equity markets  to finance project development to the extent either us or our clients are unable to obtain financing for these projects  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
nevertheless  we remain focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where investments by regulated electric utilities tend to be based on electricity demand forecasts covering decades into the future 
our clients do not typically rely on project financing to fund their projects and are typically high 
table of contents credit quality entities that traditionally have enjoyed access to long term credit markets 
please also see the risk factors section of this k which discusses those risks that may adversely affect our business 
the main contributing factor to our increased revenues was the performance of our fossil nuclear  e c and f m segments which generated strong operating and financial results for the year 
our revenue growth was fueled primarily by continued strength in the global markets for power generation capacity  petrochemicals and refined products that we serve 
we believe these markets are being driven by worldwide demand and long term economic expansion 
revenue in our e i and maintenance segments were relatively flat compared to fiscal year due to the completion of two major projects in the prior fiscal year for the maintenance segment and from decreased activity in the gulf region of the us for our e i segment 
we had record operating income during our fiscal year  and we significantly improved our results as compared to the previous fiscal year 
each of our operating segments reported improved income before income taxes  minority interest and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities for the fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year except for our investment in westinghouse segment 
the increased operating income resulted primarily from operations in our fossil nuclear  e c  maintenance and f m segments 
the strong earnings in those segments are attributable to increased volumes of work in these segments  plus increased margins in the e c and f m segments 
our investment in westinghouse segment recorded approximately million in non cash foreign currency translation losses during the fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year these translation losses occur when the jpy denominated debt is translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes at a yen us dollar exchange rate less than the prior period 
we generated significant positive operating cash flows in fiscal year primarily due to cash flows earned from contracts currently being executed 
in the previous fiscal year  our positive operating cash flows were due primarily to collections of accounts receivable related to disaster relief and emergency services work performed in associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
our credit rating was upgraded by both standard poor s and moody s investment services during the year and we successfully received an amendment to our credit facility in january that increased the committed component of our credit facility from million to billion 
this credit facility was further amended in october subsequent to our fiscal year end whereby million of the credit facility was extended for an additional year to  with the continuing ability to add additional commitments up to  million  and with the ability for us to utilize  in certain circumstances  million of our cash to collateralize additional letters of credit 
our results for fiscal year are forecast to be largely dependent on the successful execution of the contracts already in backlog 
we also forecast that the two epc contracts and one interim agreement for the ap nuclear power plants currently in the early phases of execution  should receive additional releases from our clients during the year at which time we will evaluate the inclusion to our backlog of unfilled orders 
consolidated results of operations consolidated revenues for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period the increase in consolidated revenues during our fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to significant increases in revenue by our fossil nuclear segment related to air quality and emissions control work and new coal fired power generation projects being executed 
also contributing to the increasing revenues is our work on major chemical and petrochemical projects in our e c segment as well as continued growth in our f m segment in response to increased worldwide demand

table of contents revenues are customer furnished materials for which we recognize no gross profit or loss million for fiscal year compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
consolidated gross profit for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period the revenue increases noted above contributed to our increased consolidated gross profit 
our f m segment  which has historically produced our highest gross profit percentage results  continues to experience high volumes of business driven by increased worldwide demand for fabricated piping systems for power generation  chemical and petrochemical facilities 
the increased demand of these facilities has also increased the earnings of our fossil nuclear and e c segments 
our fiscal year results included significant second quarter project write downs and profit reversals of approximately million 
additional information is included in the sections describing each operating segment 
consolidated general administrative expenses g a for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated g a was relatively flat during our fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year as we increased spending in order to support our increasing business activity levels and the remediation efforts associated with the material weaknesses in our financial reporting processes 
these cost increases were offset by reduced incentive compensation expense resulting from not achieving our targets for the year 
specific areas that contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year periods included increased labor costs due to higher administrative staffing levels  increased accounting  auditing and consulting costs and increased insurance costs at the segment levels partially offset by reductions in certain employee related insurance and compensation costs within our corporate segment for the fiscal year consolidated interest expense for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated interest expense for the fiscal year was comparable to the prior fiscal year 

table of contents consolidated income taxes for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period our consolidated effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal year was a provision of as compared to for fiscal year we recorded million of tax expense in fiscal year for tax matters under appeal  as well as matters related to foreign taxes 
consolidated earnings losses from unconsolidated entities for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period nm nm nm not meaningful 
the increased earnings from unconsolidated entities for our fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily a result of us recording a million loss  net of tax  from our military housing privatization entities in the second quarter of fiscal year our fiscal year results also reflect the benefit of earnings for the fiscal year of million  net of tax  related to the acquisition of our equity interest in westinghouse on october  additionally  in fiscal year  we sold one of our investments in military housing privatization and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million which increased by an additional million in the third quarter of as contingent liabilities retained at the time of the sale are no longer considered probable 
consolidated net income loss for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period nm nm not meaningful 
for fiscal year  our consolidated net income increased due primarily to the increasing demand for power generation capacity  petrochemicals and refined products and significant project write downs and profit reversals recorded in the prior year period as well as military housing privatization losses recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year offset by the impact of non cash foreign currency exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated westinghouse bonds 
our net income includes the impact of losses from our investment in westinghouse segment of million for fiscal year compared to a loss of million for fiscal year which primarily reflects the impact of exchange rate changes on the westinghouse bonds

additionally  we are performing early engineering work for six new nuclear power reactors in the united states 
our international work in both the nuclear and fossil fuels markets has been increasing due to a major services project in china and is expected to continue growing with the signing of an alliance agreement with a major united kingdom utility that could lead to the construction of five mw coal fired power units in the united kingdom 
revenues revenues increased billion  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to commencing and or continuing epc work on six new coal fired power plants in the united states  continued progress on emission reduction projects such as flue gas desulphurization fgd projects at coal fired power plants as full work authorizations were received and progress accelerated  continued activity on other coal fired power plant and air quality control systems aqcs  and an increase in our nuclear activity due primarily to our services contract with a limited supply of equipment for four ap nuclear reactor units in china and preliminary engineering work on domestic ap units that were awarded in fiscal year the increase in revenues was partially offset by a reduction due to several aqcs projects nearing substantial completion in the fiscal year 

table of contents gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to commencing and or continuing epc work on six new coal fired power plants plus new work and continuing progress on several major fgd and aqcs projects at other coal fired power plant projects  and an increase in our nuclear activity due to continued progress on our china nuclear project  other engineering design work and additional authorizations on ap units 
the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were partially offset by a million net reduction in gross profit for the year resulting from an increase in the estimated costs at completion on a fixed price coal fired project due to increases in estimated field labor costs  availability of labor and certain indirect costs  a decrease due to several aqcs projects nearing substantial completion  increased costs on an international project completed in fiscal year where final settlement is currently in dispute with the main contractor  and an increase in facilities costs  proposal and supervisory management costs incurred in anticipation of the development of the nuclear power market expected in the united states and certain international markets 
the fossil nuclear segment has recorded revenues of million related to unapproved change orders and claims as of august  on a percentage of completion basis 
the amounts included in our estimated total revenues at completion for these projects are estimated to be million at august  these unapproved change orders and claims relate to delays and costs attributable to others 
if we collect amounts different from the amounts we have estimated  those differences  which could be material  will be recognized as income or loss when realized 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above as the segment has experienced strong revenue and gross profit growth from both the fossil and nuclear divisions 
e i segment our e i segment s revenues were relatively flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our federal services and commercial consulting and engineering services experienced growth in fiscal year which were offset by a decline in our commercial construction services 
revenues our revenues decreased million  or  to  million for fiscal year as compared to  million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in disaster recovery services in the gulf region of the us  and a decrease commercial construction services 

table of contents the decrease in revenues in fiscal year was partially offset by increases in revenues attributed to activity from two consolidated joint ventures providing services to the doe  and an increase in services to our commercial consulting and engineering customers 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were due primarily to a loss recognized on a fixed price project in the middle east in fiscal year not incurred in  and a favorable variance related labor utilization rates and a reduction in overhead labor and fringe costs 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in disaster recovery services in the gulf region of the us  and a decrease in gross profit percentage from recording no gross profit on a consolidated military housing privatization joint venture 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in fiscal year due primarily to the factors impacting gross profit addressed above as well as a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to lower business development costs 
e c segment demand for chemical and petrochemical production and refinery capacity in the middle east and asia pacific regions provided a continued strong petrochemicals market  resulting in increased activity levels for the e c segment in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year revenues revenues in our e c segment increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to higher revenues related to demand for our engineering and engineered equipment for the petrochemical and refinery businesses  an increase in customer furnished materials million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively on two major international petrochemical projects 
no gross profit is recognized from customer furnished materials  and during fiscal year we began work on a major petrochemical plant in singapore 
the increase in revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by a decrease in services revenues from a major international petrochemical project that was at peak levels in the comparative prior fiscal year period  and a decrease in revenues from a gulf coast petrochemical fire rebuild project that was at a high services level in the comparative prior fiscal year period 
we expect fiscal year revenues to be higher than fiscal year revenues based on expected growth primarily in international markets for e c segment services and the singapore project moving toward peak activities 

table of contents gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were due primarily to increased activity primarily associated with our engineering and engineered equipment projects  a high level of contract losses recorded in the prior fiscal year as compared to the current fiscal year  and the release of license performance guarantees related to certain joint venture technology projects based on current estimates 
the increase in our gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by the following lower service activity on two petrochemical projects which were at peak levels in the prior fiscal year  and higher indirect expenses due to the growth of our business 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to the changes in gross profit addressed above as well as foreign exchange transaction gains related to changes in currency exchange rates due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the uk pound and euro during fiscal year and higher net interest income associated with improved cash flows at our e c segment offset by higher general and administrative expenses 
maintenance segment our maintenance segment experienced decreased activity during fiscal year  performing a lower volume of work in the power maintenance industry offset somewhat by an increase in capital construction work for our petrochemical customers 
revenues our revenues decreased million  or  to  million during fiscal year compared to  million for fiscal year due primarily to completion of a major domestic power construction project in fiscal year  the decision to no longer pursue maintenance work for an independent electric power company  and the overall decrease in the number of performed outages in the power maintenance industry 
the decreases noted above offset the increase in activity associated with the increased market demand for capital construction services in the petrochemical industry 
we anticipate fiscal year revenues to be lower than levels as a result of the completion of a major construction contract for a customer in the petrochemical industry in fiscal year we  however  anticipate providing additional services for current and new customers in the power generation industry due to increased market demand in this industry to offset a portion of the reduction in revenue 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year our gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year as 
table of contents compared to in fiscal year the increase in our gross profit and gross profit percentage is due primarily to an increase in capital construction revenues which are traditionally executed at higher gross profit margins than routine maintenance services 
in addition  there were loss provisions recorded during fiscal year totaling million related to disputes with an owner over project incentives as well as losses recorded on two offshore production platform contracts 
our maintenance segment has recorded revenues to date of million related to our significant estimated  project incentives and unapproved change orders and claims as of august  on a percentage of completion basis 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to the changes in gross profit discussed above 
these increases were offset primarily by an increase in indirect expenses attributable partly to an increase in operations management 
also included in indirect expenses in fiscal year was a charge associated with the dissolution of a foreign entity 
f m segment in fiscal year  we experienced strong demand for our fabrication and manufacturing services 
strength in the global piping systems markets for oil refineries  power  petrochemical and chemical plants has continued to expand 
we have also expanded our capacity to meet this demand 
our new fabrication facility in mexico is now our largest facility and will be utilized to capture more of the available market 
revenues our revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase is due primarily to significant new awards in both the domestic and foreign markets and the global increase in demand of our manufactured and fabricated products 
we experienced increases in the foreign and domestic market as a result of the increasing demand in the petrochemical  refining and power generation industries 
in fiscal year  we anticipate increased foreign and domestic demand in the petrochemical  refining and power generation industries for our fabrication and manufacturing and distribution services 
as a result of this higher demand  we in turn expect increased revenues as a result of the additional capacity which will be available to this segment during the fiscal year 
gross profit and gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit of million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million fiscal year our gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year this increase is attributable to the increase in demand for most of our products resulting in stronger volume and improved gross profit in both the domestic and foreign markets as discussed above 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to the increases in revenues and the factors impacting gross profit discussed above 
g a increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to increased labor costs resulting from increased headcount levels to support the higher demand in our markets 

table of contents investment in westinghouse segment the investment in westinghouse segment includes our equity investment in westinghouse that was acquired on october  the total impact from the investment in westinghouse segment on our pre tax income before other items for the twelve months ended august  and  respectively  were losses of million and million  pre tax  and million and million  net of tax and other items  respectively 
the pre tax income before other items of the investment in westinghouse segment for the twelve months ended august  and included the following legal and professional fees including costs incurred during fiscal to obtain audited financial statements of westinghouse in connection with the acquisition of million and million  respectively  interest expense on the westinghouse bonds including discount accretion  letter of credit fees and deferred financing cost amortization of approximately million and million  respectively  and foreign currency translation losses on the westinghouse bonds and the interest payment foreign currency forward contracts  net  of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  our net income loss for the twelve months ended august  and includes income from our interest in westinghouse earnings of million and million  respectively 
the increase in westinghouse s earnings is attributable to strength in its nuclear fuel  nuclear services and nuclear power plants segments 
g a expenses for the investment in westinghouse segment were lower in fiscal year than for fiscal year due to costs incurred in fiscal year to obtain westinghouse audited financial statements in connection with the acquisition 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
if we exercise the put option for our full equity investment in westinghouse  we would expect to recover of our investment that was originally made in jpy 
westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
we expect that reliable financial information about westinghouse s operations will be available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
as a result  we record our interest of the equity earnings loss reported to us by westinghouse based upon westinghouse s calendar quarterly reporting periods  or two months in arrears of our current periods 
under this policy  the results of westinghouse s operations from july  through their calendar quarter ended june  were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  for the twelve months ended august   westinghouse s results from the acquisition effective date of october  through their calendar quarter ended june   a nine month period  were included in our financial results for the twelve months ended august  corporate general and administrative expenses g a decreased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to reductions in certain compensation costs and employee related insurance costs  which were charged to our other segments 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increased costs to support the increasing revenue base and level of business activity as well as increased consulting fees and audit fees 
we expect our g a to be higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to anticipated additional costs required to support the growth in our business activities as a result of the continuing strength of our markets 

table of contents segment analysis fiscal year compared to fiscal year fossil nuclear segment our fossil nuclear segment is experiencing significant growth in domestic demand for our services primarily in the areas of emissions control and coal fired power generation facilities 
revenues the increase in revenues of million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is attributable to an increase in activity and commencement of work on our air quality control systems aqcs fgd on domestic us projects that were awarded during fiscal years and  an increase in activity on two major clean coal power projects as these projects reached peak progress levels in fiscal year  and an increase in revenues from our nuclear division due to our china nuclear power plant award  domestic support of advanced passive ap site specific design and evaluation as well as other engineering design work 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by substantial completion in fiscal year of two major fossil power projects  a reduction in spending by key clients on transmission and distribution projects and lower revenues from storm restoration projects in fiscal year gross profit and gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit of million or  for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is attributable to an increase in gross profit results on several aqcs fgd projects and two major coal power projects  and the fiscal year wolf hollow adverse litigation ruling resulting in million reduction of revenue and gross profit in fiscal year the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage was partially offset by tentative and final settlements reached on claims and disputed amounts with the owner and major subcontractors on one substantially complete major epc fossil power project contributing to the reduction in gross profit of million during fiscal year  a reduction of gross profit contributed from a major aqcs fgd project as it approached completion during fiscal year  a decrease in distribution system activity by key clients  reduction in storm restoration projects  losses on transmission bid projects  and expected losses on certain long term distribution contracts  and an increase in facilities costs  proposal costs and supervisory management labor due to growth in business activities in the fossil nuclear segment 
the fossil nuclear segment has recorded revenues of million related to unapproved change orders and claims as of august  on a percentage of completion basis 
the amounts included in our estimated total revenues at completion for these projects are estimated to be million 
these unapproved change orders and claims relate to delays and costs attributable to others

table of contents income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities and income loss from discontinued operations the increase from a loss position of million for fiscal year to an income position of million for fiscal year is primarily attributable to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above as the segment has experienced strong revenue and gross profit growth from both the fossil and nuclear divisions 
e i segment fiscal year included a significant amount of disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services we performed in connection with hurricanes katrina and rita while fiscal year reflects a more typical overall revenue volume for government contracting activity 
revenues the decrease in revenues of million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was attributable to significantly lower levels of disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services in fiscal year compared to the significant amount of work performed in fiscal year the decrease in revenues for fiscal year was partially offset by increases in revenues attributed to activity from two consolidated joint ventures providing services to the doe  services provided to commercial customers in the gulf and southeast regions of the us  a recently consolidated military housing privatization joint venture  and domestic environmental services performed for us government customers 
gross profit and gross profit percentage the decrease in gross profit of million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to significantly lower levels of disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services in fiscal year compared to the significant amount of work performed in fiscal year  the negative impact in fiscal year of additional estimated costs to complete certain fixed unit price projects and reversal of previously recognized revenue  a loss recognized in fiscal year of million on a fixed price project in asia  a decrease in gross profit percentage earned on our consolidated joint ventures for the doe  and a decrease in gross profit percentage resulting from recording no gross profit on the recently consolidated military housing privatization joint venture loss contracts now being recognized at break even 
the decreases were partially offset by an increase in demand for services to commercial customers in the gulf and southeast regions of the us and improved gross profit percentage earned on these services  an increase in gross profit and related gross profit percentage in federal environmental services  and the positive impacts from proposed final indirect billing rates for fiscal year and increased estimated billing rates resulting from negotiations relating to a prior fiscal year

the increase in revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by completion of two refinery projects in fiscal year and completion of major construction activities on another refinery project in fiscal year gross profit and gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit of million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is attributable to contract activity on a major international petrochemical project due to the project working near peak activity level for the entire fiscal year  an increase in the number of other petrochemical projects in progress  an increase in volume of proprietary technology related engineering work  and recognition  in fiscal year prior comparative period  of losses on three refining projects totaling million 
these increases in gross profit were offset by the following a charge of million in fiscal year primarily related to an adjustment of a previously recorded claim and other cost increases on a completed contract  and contract losses of approximately million recorded in fiscal year on a us gulf coast epc furnace contract 
the increase in gross profit percentage is attributable to cost increases in fiscal year on certain refinery projects 
offsetting the increase is higher revenue associated with customer furnished materials  which describes circumstances where we assist in the procurement of equipment and materials on a cost reimbursable basis on behalf of our customers 
revenues and costs on customer furnished materials do not

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  we had million of revolving credit available for borrowings under our credit facility at august  as discussed above  it is unclear at this point what impact current market conditions will have on our ability to obtain sufficient letter of credit support to grow our business to the extent these conditions negatively impact our ability to obtain letters of credit  our operating results could be adversely affected 
as reflected by the increase in our cash and cash equivalents  we generated significant positive operating cash flows in fiscal primarily from positive cash flows on projects being executed in our e c  fossil nuclear and f m segments 
we generated significant positive operating cash flows in fiscal due primarily to collections by our e i segment of accounts receivable related to fiscal year disaster relief and emergency response services work and the positive cash performance on several epc projects in our fossil nuclear segment
