item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the primary business of bancorp is consumer deposit products and residential and commercial mortgages 
bancorp operates primarily in anne arundel county  maryland  as well as surrounding areas in maryland  virginia and delaware 
bancorp has experienced similar challenges faced by many institutions caused by the slowdown in the real estate market  including increased loan delinquencies and a decrease in the demand for certain loan products including construction  land acquisition and development loans 
in addition  stronger competition for new loans and deposits has caused the interest rate spread between bancorp s cost of funds and what it earns on loans to decrease from this is primarily due to decreases in interest rates earned on loans  as interest rates paid on deposits increased 
even though bancorp s total loan portfolio has increased from  the decrease in the interest rate spread has caused net interest income to decrease from in addition  bancorp has experienced an increase in loan delinquencies  which resulted in the allowance for loan losses to increase from the decrease in net interest income and the increase in the allowance for loan losses  coupled with a modest increase in variable expenses  such as compensation  office expense and advertising  have caused bancorp s overall profitability to decrease from bancorp is challenged with maintaining high asset quality during the recent slowdown in the real estate market 
it has experienced an increase in delinquent loans over prior years and has increased its allowance for loan losses from accordingly 
bancorp believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
going forward  bancorp s challenge will be to continue to grow assets in the form of mortgage loans and commercial loans  while increasing core deposits 
increasing loans while maintaining strong asset quality coupled with increased core deposits  which traditionally have a lower cost of funds  should enable bancorp to earn a profitable interest spread 
in addition  bancorp will be challenged to maintain low overhead costs should inflation increase 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans and deposits  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead 
critical accounting policies bancorp s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are set forth on pages f through f of these significant accounting policies  bancorp considers the policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate 
bancorp has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
bancorp s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements

the net increase in deposits was primarily used to fund loan growth 
fhlb advances 
fhlb advances increased  or at december  to  compared to  at december  this increase was the result of management s decision to borrow funds from fhlb at more favorable rates than would have been necessary to attract the needed funds through customer deposits

bancorp is uncertain whether it will be able to reduce the interest rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities by attracting lower cost deposits  due to the general expectation of continued increased competition for deposit accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the bank s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio at least as often as quarterly and its loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly 
all loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the bank s portfolio as a group are evaluated 
the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s delinquency committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors as the inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
an increase in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the year to the end of a year is the result after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
as more commercial and higher loan to value loans are contained in the portfolio  the greater the allowance for loan losses will be 
changes in estimation methods may take place based upon the status of the economy and the estimate of the value of collateral and  as a result  the allowance may increase or decrease 
the loan loss allowance has increased when the board believes trends are negative and contributions to the allowance have decreased when trends are more positive 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  or to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase was a result of the current year s addition to the allowance partially offset by charge offs incurred 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was a result of an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in the loan portfolio  and management s determination that adding to the provision for loan losses was appropriate for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as compared to the year ended december  other income and non interest expenses 
revenues from mortgage banking activities decreased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a  decrease in gain on sale of loans  and a decrease in mortgage processing and servicing fees of  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these decreases were attributable to a general slowdown in loan activity  which resulted in fewer loans sold on the secondary market during and less mortgage processing and servicing fees during real estate commissions increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of commissions earned on large settlements that took place during real estate management fees increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional properties being managed in other non interest income increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of a one time gain of  realized on a sale of an investment by crownsville  and miscellaneous fees collected by the bank

liquidity and capital resources 
bancorp s liquidity is determined by its ability to raise funds through loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  capital  or the sale of loans 
based on the internal and external sources available  bancorp s liquidity position exceeded anticipated short term and long term needs at december  core deposits  considered to be stable funding sources and defined to include all deposits except time deposits of  or more  equaled of total deposits at december  the bank s experience is that a substantial portion of certificates of deposit will renew at time of maturity and will remain on deposit with the bank 
additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds  which may be drawn upon when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit equal to of the bank s assets with fhlb atlanta 
the available line of credit with fhlb atlanta was  at december   of which  was outstanding at that time 
short term borrowings were  and long term advances were  the maturities of these long term advances at december  are as follows dollars in thousands description rate amount maturity fhlb advances to fhlb advances to fhlb advances fhlb advances fhlb advances fhlb advances to thereafter in assessing its liquidity the management of bancorp considers operating requirements  anticipated deposit flows  expected funding of loans  deposit maturities and borrowing availability  so that sufficient funds may be available on short notice to meet obligations and business opportunities as they arise 
as of december   bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above 
this amount does not include undisbursed lines of credit  home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit  in the aggregate amount of  which bancorp anticipates it will be able to fund  if required  from these liquidity sources in the regular course of business 
in addition to the foregoing  the payment of dividends is a use of cash  but is not expected to have a material effect on liquidity 
as of december   bancorp had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possible additional discretionary  actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis and  in connection with this review  evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
while continuous movement of interest rates is certain  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan servicing portfolio  bancorp originates a substantial amount of construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the following table represents bancorp s npv at december  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon information provided to the ots
