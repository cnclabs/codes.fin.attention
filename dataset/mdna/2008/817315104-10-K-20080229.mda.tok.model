item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
restatement of prior period financial information in january  we notified cms that we had identified potential errors in our determination of the best price used to calculate medicaid rebate amounts in prior periods 
as a follow up to this disclosure to cms  our management  with the oversight of our audit committee  is reviewing our government pricing activities affected by the material weakness in our internal controls related to these potential errors 
we restated our financial statements for the years ended december  and and the unaudited quarterly information in note t in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended march  june and september  and to reduce the amount of product revenue earned during such periods 
the amounts by which we have reduced revenues for contingent rebates were based on management s best estimates and assumptions made prior to any concurrence by cms 
these amounts may change as a result of future communications with cms  and we cannot be certain that we have not overestimated the amount of additional rebates we may be required to pay  that the amount of any additional rebate payments or other payments we may owe will not exceed our current estimates  or that we will not be subject to fines  penalties or interest 
the discussion and analysis set forth in this item has been amended to reflect the restatement as described in the prior paragraph  in the explanatory note at the beginning of this annual report on form k and in note u to our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate amount by which we have reduced revenue in prior periods is approximately million 
the amount by which we have reduced revenues for the first three quarters of  combined  and the fiscal years ended december  and is approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for this reason  the discussion and data set forth in this section may not be comparable to discussions and data in our previously filed reports 
executive overview we are a research based pharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing differentiated products that address large and growing markets and unmet medical needs and are prescribed principally by primary care physicians and certain specialists 
our currently marketed products are xopenex levalbuterol hcl inhalation solution  a short acting bronchodilator  for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients six years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease  xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate inhalation aerosol  a hydrofluoroalkane  or hfa  metered dose inhaler  or mdi  for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adults  adolescents and children four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease  brovana arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution  a long acting  twice daily morning and evening  maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with copd  including chronic bronchitis and emphysema  and lunesta eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia in adults 
we market these products in the united states to primary care physicians  allergists  pulmonologists  pediatricians  hospitals  psychiatrists and sleep specialists  as appropriate  primarily through our sales organization comprised of approximately  sales professionals 
in addition  we recently obtained from nycomed the exclusive us distribution rights to two products that have been approved by the fda  omnaris aq nasal spray and alvesco hfa inhalation aerosol  which we expect to launch commercially during factors that will be critical for us in achieving near term success include our ability to increase our lunesta revenues  despite increasing competition  grow xopenex inhalation solution revenues outside of the medicare market by maintaining targeted sales and marketing efforts aimed at the retail and hospital market segments 
revenues from the sale of xopenex inhalation solution have been  and we expect will continue to be  adversely affected on a comparable basis as a result of restrictions on the medicare part b reimbursement amount for xopenex inhalation solution  continue to increase our xopenex hfa revenues  successfully market and sell brovana  particularly in the home health care market segment  which could be adversely affected by potential restrictions on medicare part b reimbursement or changes in the medicare part b reimbursement amount for brovana  manage expenses effectively to help preserve profitability and positive cash flow from operations  and maintain patent protection for our products  particularly for xopenex inhalation solution for which four andas have been submitted to the fda 
we believe that success in each of these areas should allow us to continue to be profitable in the near term and provide us the ability to repay our outstanding convertible debt of million 
if not converted  repurchased at the noteholders or our option  or otherwise refinanced earlier  the principal amount of this debt becomes due as follows principal amount of convertible debt maturity date this note may be converted into cash at the option of the noteholders at certain specified time periods  the first of which is in october our long term success depends in part on our ability to successfully develop or acquire and commercialize new product candidates 
our material sources of revenue in were product revenues from lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution and xopenex hfa and to a lesser extent  revenues from brovana and royalty revenues received from sales of allegra  clarinex and xyzal xusal 
we expect that sales of lunesta and xopenex inhalation solution will represent the majority of our total revenues in we do not have long term sales contracts with our customers and we rely on purchase orders for sales of our products 
reductions  delays or cancellations of orders for lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution or xopenex hfa could adversely affect our operating results 
if sales of lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution  xopenex hfa and brovana do not meet our expectations  we may not have sufficient revenue to achieve our business plan and our business will not be successful 
in  we expect to be profitable for the year on an operating and net income basis 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as compared to as we incur increasing sales and marketing costs related to the anticipated product commercialization of omnaris aq and alvesco hfa  including the anticipated increase in sales force capacity in order to accommodate the launch of these two products  as well as continued revenue growth in our currently marketed products 
we expect to continue to invest in marketing programs related to lunesta  brovana and xopenex and incur significant costs related to expected omnaris aq and alvesco hfa commercial introductions 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as compared to as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to studies for lunesta  xopenex hfa  and brovana  and for continued development of our earlier stage drug candidates  as well as increased drug discovery efforts and development activities for the ciclesonide pipeline 
as part of our business strategy  in  and in the future  we expect to consider and  as appropriate  consummate acquisitions of other technologies  product candidates  approved products  and or businesses 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any such acquisitions 
significant and developments in early and  our key developments included the following corporate development licensing in january  we entered into an agreement with nycomed for the exclusive us distribution  development and commercialization in the united states  its territories and possessions of nycomed s compound ciclesonide  and products incorporating such compound  including alvesco hfa inhalation aerosol metered dose inhaler  for use in the treatment of asthma  and omnaris aq nasal spray for use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis 
under the agreement  we paid nycomed an upfront payment of million in february and may be required to make subsequent payments of up to million over the life of the agreement upon accomplishment of various development and sales milestones 
nycomed will also receive compensation for supplying finished product pursuant to the agreement  including a supply price for the products  which will be based on nycomed s manufacturing costs plus a percentage of such costs  and quarterly royalty payments based on our net sales of the products

if all milestones are met  gsk will be obligated to pay us million in aggregate license and milestone payments 
we are also entitled to receive double digit royalties that escalate upon increased product sales  and compensation for supplying the product to gsk pursuant to a supply agreement that is expected to be entered into by the parties 
in july  we entered into an agreement with eisai for the development and commercialization of our eszopiclone product  which we market as lunesta in the united states 
under this agreement  eisai will be responsible for completing remaining clinical trials necessary for attaining marketing approval from the japanese regulatory authorities and  contingent on obtaining regulatory approval  commercialization of the product in japan 
we received an initial milestone payment and will be entitled to receive subsequent payments upon accomplishment of various development  regulatory and pricing milestones  as well as royalties on product sales

douglas e 
reedich  our former senior vice president  legal affairs  was employed by us through december  in order to ensure an orderly transition in the handling of our legal matters 
litigation and investigations in november  the sec notified us that the investigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices had been completed and that no enforcement action was being recommended 
in october  we reached a settlement with the parties to both the state and federal derivative actions brought against us as a nominal defendant and certain of our current and former officers and directors related to certain stock option grants and alleged violations of federal securities laws  that provided for the dismissal of both actions 
the settlement resolved all claims and included no finding of wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants and no cash payment other than attorneys fees 
as part of the settlement  we have adopted  and are in the process of completing the implementation of  stock option grant and other procedures that reflect developing best practices 
the settlement became final and effective in january upon final approval by the state court and entry of dismissal with prejudice by the federal court 
in october  we reached a final settlement agreement with tharos laboratories  inc  or tharos  with respect to the litigation brought against us by tharos alleging trademark infringement  dilution  unfair competition  false advertising and false designation of origin arising out of our use of our silk luna moth design in connection with lunesta 
as a result of this settlement agreement  the case has been dismissed 
in june  we filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  or the court  a stipulation of settlement regarding two securities class action lawsuits  or class actions  pending in the court naming sepracor and certain of our current and former officers and one director as defendants 
the class actions  which were filed on behalf of certain purchasers of our equity and debt securities  or the plaintiffs  allege that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements relating to the testing  safety and likelihood of approval of tecastemizole by the fda 
the stipulation of settlement contains no admission of wrongdoing 
sepracor and the other defendants have always maintained and continue to believe that we did not engage in any wrongdoing or otherwise commit any violation of federal or state securities laws or other laws 
however  given the potential cost and burden of continued litigation  we believe the settlement was in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders 
under the terms of the stipulation of settlement  in june we paid into escrow million in settlement of the class actions and  in july  received an million reimbursement from our insurance carriers 
we recorded the litigation settlement expense of million  relating to this matter  during the quarter ended march  in september  the court granted final approval of the stipulation of settlement and entered a final judgment consistent with the stipulation of settlement 
the settlement is now final and the total settlement amount has been released from escrow 
pursuant to the final judgment entered by the court  the court dismissed the class actions with prejudice  and the plaintiffs are deemed to have released all claims against us 
in april  we were served with a complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  ca no 
cv  by dey  ca and dey  inc  referred to collectively as dey  alleging that the manufacture and sale of brovana infringes or will induce infringement of a single us patent for which dey owns all rights  title and interest 
in april  we filed an answer and counterclaim to this complaint seeking to invalidate the originally asserted patent and a second related patent 
in may  dey filed a reply asserting infringement of the second patent 
under the current scheduling order  trial will begin no earlier than january  regulatory in november  we announced that cms established a product specific billing code  or j code  for brovana under the medicare part b benefit  which became effective on january  in april  we announced the commercial availability of brovana for the treatment of copd 
in july  we submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  to the european regulatory authorities for lunivia for the treatment of insomnia 
approval of the maa  which is the european union equivalent of a new drug application  or nda  in the united states  would allow authorization to market lunivia in the european union 
pursuant to our agreement with gsk  we are responsible for supporting the maa until final approval  or such earlier date mutually agreed upon by the parties  and gsk is responsible for supporting the maa thereafter 
we received a consolidated report from the reviewing maa rapporteurs in december and responded to them in early approval of the maa is targeted for the fourth quarter of in june  we announced that cms determined that  based on its interpretation of the statutory language of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or mma  it was required to discontinue the stand alone reimbursement for xopenex inhalation solution and generic albuterol  which had been in place since january  and instead calculate the reimbursement for xopenex inhalation solution and generic albuterol based on the blended weighted average selling price  or asp  for the two products 
this new reimbursement became effective on july  using a blended weighted asp for xopenex inhalation solution results in reimbursement for the product that is considerably lower than the published selling price for the product in the wholesaler distribution channel 
the new reimbursement rate is subject to change quarterly based upon the respective contribution of commercial sales of xopenex inhalation solution and generic albuterol to the quarterly blended weighted asp calculation 
this quarterly asp calculation is mandated by the mma 
revenues from the sale of xopenex inhalation solution have been  and we expect will continue to be  adversely affected on a comparable basis as a result of this change 
in addition  on december   president bush signed into law legislation mandating that xopenex inhalation solution and generic albuterol be reimbursed at the lower of their stand alone weighted asp and the blended weighted asp for xopenex inhalation solution and generic albuterol 
the effect of this legislation is that xopenex inhalation solution will continue to be reimbursed at the blended rate and generic albuterol will be reimbursed at its stand alone weighted asp 
the legislation goes into effect on april  other key developments in february  intend to increase our sales force capacity by at least sales professionals in order to accommodate the commercialization of omnaris aq and alvesco hfa 
in january  we notified cms that we had identified potential errors in our determination of the best price used to calculate medicaid rebate amounts in prior periods 
as a follow up to this disclosure to cms  our management  with the oversight of our audit committee  is reviewing our government pricing activities affected by the material weakness in our internal controls related to these potential errors 
in october  we announced that we had decided to reduce our sales force by approximately positions 
the decision was based on our evaluation of the structure  size and allocation of our direct sales force at that time and was intended to result in cost savings in fiscal year as of december   this sales force reduction was completed 
in february  we paid in full million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  which matured on february   plus approximately million in accrued interest

the increase in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales in as compared to primarily reflects an overall increase in government and commercial rebates and discounts as a result of i an increase in medicaid discounts that we offered on the sales of xopenex inhalation solution  lunesta  and xopenex hfa  ii an increase in discounts given through medicare part b program that we offered on the sales of xopenex inhalation solution as a result of the cms bundling decision  which created a new reimbursement code for xopenex inhalation solution  iii an increase in managed care commercial discounts we offered on the sales of lunesta and xopenex hfa  iv an increase in discounts given through medicare part d program that we offered on the sales of lunesta  and v a decrease in xopenex hfa units sold under a government contract with the veterans administration in as compared to returns also increased in as compared to  which is primarily due to a higher rate of return of xopenex inhalation solution as a result cms decision to discontinue the stand alone reimbursement for the product and also higher returns of lunesta  primarily in the mg tablets and all hospital units doses 
in addition  other discounts increased as we increased the utilization of coupon programs  primarily related to xopenex hfa 
partially offsetting these increases in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales was a decrease in wholesaler fee for service charges primarily related to credits earned due to lunesta and xopenex inhalation solution gross price increases during royalties and license fees were million in as compared with million in  respectively  an increase of approximately 
royalties earned on the sales of allegra under our agreement with sanofi aventis increased to million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately

if patent based exclusivity is lost for one or more of these products in any foreign jurisdiction  our rights to receive royalty revenue with respect to such product in the relevant jurisdiction will terminate  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

this increase in obligations to the third party is due to the increase in royalties earned in as compared to research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily due to the million fee we paid to bial pursuant to the license agreement for bia  which we now refer to as sep  increased spending on two of our early stage programs  sep and sep  the lunesta phase iiib iv and pediatric programs and increased drug discovery efforts 
in  we intend to significantly increase research and development expenditures over we expect our principal research and development activities will relate to the following programs  drug discovery  lunesta  sep  ciclesonide pipeline  sep  and sep drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase iii clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase iii clinical trials  an nda must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the nda prior to commercialization of the drug 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase iiib and iv studies 
phase iiib studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the nda is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase iv studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
phase iv studies may be requested by the fda either before or after the fda has approved an nda 
these studies may also be independently initiated by the company whose nda has been approved 
the fda uses post marketing studies to gather additional information about a product s safety  efficacy or optimal use 
successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain any approval required by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential product candidates  see risk factors 
below is a summary of development of our products and product candidates that represent or more of our direct project research and development spending for the year ended december  the estimate of completion of phase column contains forward looking statements regarding expected timing of completion of product development phases 
completion of product development  if successful  culminates in the submission of an nda to the fda  however  there can be no assurance that the fda will accept for filing  or approve  any nda 
the actual timing of completion of phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
in the table below  the three fda approved products and two product candidates listed accounted for approximately of our direct project research and development spending in no other product candidate accounted for more than of our direct research and development spending in product or product candidate indication phase of development estimate of completion of phase lunesta eszopiclone insomnia xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate respiratory asthma brovana arformoterol tartrate respiratory copd sep depression phase ii sep depression phase i we commercially introduced lunesta in april we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december we commercially introduced brovana in april below is a summary of expenditure information related to our products and product candidates representing or more of our direct project research and development spending during the year ended december  and  as well as the costs incurred to date on these projects 
the costs in this analysis include only direct costs and do not include certain indirect labor  overhead  share based compensation  up front license fees  milestone payments  or other costs that benefit multiple projects

selling  marketing and distribution selling  marketing and distribution expenses were million in as compared with million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salary and other compensation related expense as a result of hiring additional sales representatives and management in the second quarter of to support our marketed products  in addition to increased costs associated with our april commercialization of brovana 
these increases were offset by a decrease in marketing  advertising and promotional expenses primarily related to costs to support lunesta 
in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase over as a result of the expected commercial introduction of omnaris aq in the first half of and the expected commercial introduction of alvesco hfa in the second half of  offsetting any anticipated savings from the restructuring of the sales force in the fourth quarter of general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in as compared with million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is largely due to an increase in legal fees of approximately million related to patent support and litigation costs 
litigation settlement litigation settlement expense was million in compared with in in june  we filed in the court a stipulation of settlement regarding two class actions pending in the court naming sepracor and certain of our current and former officers and one director as defendants 
as previously disclosed  the class actions alleged that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements relating to the testing  safety and likelihood of approval of tecastemizole by the fda 
under the terms of the stipulation of settlement  in june  we paid into escrow million in settlement of the class actions and  in july  received an million reimbursement from our insurance carriers 
the settlement is now final and the total settlement amount has been released from escrow 
we recorded the litigation settlement expense of million relating to this matter during the quarter ended march  restructuring expense restructuring expense was million in compared to in during the quarter ended december   we completed an evaluation of our sales force structure  size and allocation in an attempt to maximize efficiency of our sales force 
this evaluation resulted in a decision to restructure and re align our sales force

the possible adverse impact to our xopenex inhalation solution sales if an at risk generic launch were to occur or we are unable to successfully defend our patents rights and increased sales and marketing expenses as a result of the expected commercial introduction of omnaris aq in the first half of and the expected commercial introduction of alvesco hfa in the second half of  management continues to conclude a valuation allowance is required for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
if in the future  we determine based on our future profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
such release of the valuation allowance could occur within the next months upon resolution of the aforementioned uncertainties 
year ended december  restated compared to restated revenues product sales were  million in as compared with million in  an increase of approximately 
sales of lunesta were million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily the result of a increase in the number of units sold  which is principally attributable to twelve months of sales in as compared to nine months of sales in the increase is also related to a increase in net selling price  which resulted from a gross sale price increase of approximately  offset by sales discounts and allowances

for  as a result of the restatement  the dollar value of government rebates and contractual discounts increased by million and  as a percentage of net sales  increased from to 
the increase in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales in as compared to primarily reflected an increase in government rebates and contractual discounts as a result of an increase in discounts we offered primarily on the sales xopenex hfa  which was commercially introduced in december  an increase in discounts offered to managed care organizations  and an increase in discounts given through medicare and medicaid programs 
wholesaler fee for service discounts also increased in as compared to  as these discounts did not commence until the second quarter of offsetting these increases in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales were a decrease in government rebates and contractual discounts due to a reversal of reserves relating to rebates under the department of veterans affairs tricare pharmacy benefits program  which was based on a us federal court of appeals ruling in september that pharmaceutical manufacturers are not required to provide reimbursement for drugs purchased through the tricare program  and a decrease in sales returns primarily due to a decrease in actual returns for xopenex inhalation solution and the weighting of lunesta returns which are estimated at a lower rate 
royalties were million in as compared with million in  respectively  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in royalties earned on the sales of allegra under our agreement with sanofi aventis  which were million in as compared to million in  primarily because we ceased to receive royalties on sales of allegra in the united states beginning in late pursuant to the terms of our us agreement with sanofi aventis  our royalties on the sale of allegra in the united states  which have historically been between and million per year  terminated based on the introduction of a generic equivalent of this product in the united states in september we are still entitled to receive royalties on the sale of allegra outside of the united states in countries where we hold patents covering allegra and no generic equivalent product has been introduced 
royalties earned on sales of clarinex under our agreement with schering plough increased to million in from million in in august  we were notified that several andas containing paragraph iv certifications had been received by the fda seeking approval of generic versions of certain of schering plough s clarinex products

we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december the increase in the cost as a percentage of gross sales is primarily due to an increase in the cost of materials used in manufacturing 
cost of royalties earned was  for  compared with  in the cost of royalties in both periods relates to an obligation to a third party as a result of royalties we earn from schering plough based on its sales of clarinex 
this increase in obligations to the third party is due to the increase in royalties earned in as compared to research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily due to our increased spending on two of our early stage projects  sep and sep  the lunesta phase iiib iv projects  and drug discovery efforts

general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in as compared with million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is largely due to a million increase in personnel related costs  which is primarily attributable to a million increase in stock based compensation expense over as a result of our january  implementation of sfas r 
the increase was also partly due to a million increase in legal fees related to patent support and litigation and shareholder lawsuit related costs  as well as expense associated with responding to the sec s informal inquiry into our stock option grants and practices and the related internal investigation 
other income expense interest income was million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is due to higher average balances of cash and short and long term investments combined with an increase in the interest rates earned on investments in our monthly average cash and investment balance was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

fiscal year was the first time we generated income from operations and  therefore we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until profitability has been sustained over an appropriate time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we determine  based on future profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical product revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales  upon delivery  when title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record revenues from product sales net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
the timing of product shipments and receipts can have a significant impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a period 
also  the majority of our products are sold through distributors 
revenue could be adversely affected if distributor inventories increased to an excessive level 
if this were to happen  we could experience reduced purchases in subsequent periods  or product returns from the distribution channel due to overstocking  low end user demand or product expiration 
we have invested in resources to track channel inventories in order to prevent distributor inventories from increasing to excessive levels 
if we determine that distributor inventories are at excessive levels  we do not recognize revenue for those shipments that we believe represent excessive inventory 
revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements we have entered into collaborative agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our eszopiclone product outside of the united states  canada and mexico 
these agreements are in the form of license agreements that call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestones  and royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives marketing approval 
our revenue recognition policy for all multiple revenue generating arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
royalty revenue recognition royalty revenue is recognized based upon estimates of sales in licensed territories in the period in which the sales occur 
these estimates are derived when possible from information from the company paying the royalty  or from historical data and third party prescription data 
changes in market conditions  such as the introduction of competitive products  can lead to significant deviations from historical patterns and therefore cause estimates to be inaccurate 
when estimates differ from actual results  the difference is recognized in the following quarter  provided the difference is not material to the results of either quarter 
historically  our estimates have not materially differed from our actual results 
product sales allowances and reserves we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances payment term discounts  wholesaler fee for service discounts  government rebates and contractual discounts includes medicaid discounts  medicare discounts  managed care discounts  chargebacks and group purchasing organization  or gpo  contract discounts  returns and other discounts 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
based on known market events and trends  internal and external historical trends  third party data  customer buying patterns and up to date knowledge of contractual and statutory requirements  we are able to make reasonable estimates of sales discounts 
payment term discounts we offer our direct purchase customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on product sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary  and historical adjustments have not been material 
based on our history of estimating payment term discounts and the low dollar exposure  we do not anticipate that changes to estimates will have a material impact on net sales 
wholesaler fee for service discounts in both and  we entered into agreements with certain wholesaler customers that provide these wholesalers with the opportunity to earn discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
our effective rate of wholesaler fee for service discounts applied across all product gross sales in was approximately as compared to in our accruals for wholesaler fee for service discounts are based on actual data of product sales made to wholesale customers with agreements and not on estimates 
if the percentage of gross sales sold to wholesalers with agreements increases  our liability related to these discounts could increase materially 
government rebates and contractual discounts medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through the medicaid drug rebate program as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
we rebate individual states for all eligible units purchased under the medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation  which is driven off of our average manufacturer price  or amp 
we estimate the expected rebate per unit to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on expected changes in rebate pricing 
we also examine the historical rebate trends and the trend of sales that become eligible for medicaid programs and any changes expected to these trends 
in addition  certain states have supplemental rebate programs  which provide such states with an additional rebate 
supplemental rebates  like rebates under the medicaid drug rebate program  are recorded as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced quarterly in arrears and paid thirty days after they are invoiced 
as a result  our accrual consists of i an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
we recorded a provision for medicaid rebates of and of gross sales in and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to an increase in medicaid discounts that we offered on the sales of xopenex inhalation solution  lunesta  and xopenex hfa 
the increase is also the result of a medicaid reserve reversal in relating to a estimate 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected medicaid activity and rebate per unit amounts 
the most significant estimate we make in connection with this accrual is the estimate of the number of medicaid eligible units in the distribution channel 
with the exception of the best price matters described in more detail in the explanatory note to this report on form k and notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  our estimates have been approximately accurate in recent quarters 
although the actual medicaid rebate may vary by more than of the estimated eligible medicaid units in future periods  we believe  based on prior experience  a variation in our estimate is reasonably likely 
a understatement of medicaid eligible units at december  would have resulted in an additional provision of approximately million 
medicare discounts part b we record accruals for rebates to be provided through medicare part b programs  as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
we established a medicare part b rebate program in order to increase the access by medicare part b beneficiaries to our xopenex inhalation solution product through medicare part b pharmacy providers  or mpps 
we estimate the expected rebate using historical data and by examining trends and expected changes in medicare part b codes 
medicare part b payments are paid to mpps primarily on a monthly basis 
accordingly  the provision typically relates to the activity over a one month period and  as a result  the total provision consists of i an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current month s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior months unpaid rebates  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
medicare discounts part d effective january   medicare created a prescription drug benefit for its beneficiaries known as medicare part d 
the cms contracted with numerous health plans and prescription drug benefit plans to design and administer the drug benefit  including the development of a formulary which defines which products are covered and at what co pay level 
we pay rebates to certain medicare part d health plans and prescription drug plans on the utilization of lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution  xopenex hfa and brovana 
xopenex inhalation solution has been  and we expect that it will remain  subject to reimbursement under medicare part b resulting in minimal medicare part d utilization 
our accruals for medicare part d are estimated based on projected sales volumes through the contracted health and drug plans 
the provision for both medicare rebates was of gross sales in and in actual medicare discounts could change significantly in the future based on future medicare reimbursement classifications 
medicare rebates at our current reimbursement levels represent an immaterial amount of sales rebates 
based on the accuracy of estimates and the small dollar amounts involved  we do not expect changes in estimates to have a material impact on net sales 
managed care discounts we have entered into agreements with certain mcos whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on the achievement of sales volume and or market share purchasing targets 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on discount rates and expected levels of sales volumes of these mcos during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and sales trends and expected changes to these trends 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears 
accordingly  our accrual consists of i the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior quarters unpaid discounts  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
the provision for mco rebates was approximately and of gross sales in and  respectively 
actual mco discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
however  in part due to the fact that only a few organizations currently account for approximately of our mco discounts  our mco discount estimates have historically been very similar to the actual mco discounts 
we expect that a small number of organizations will continue to account for substantially all of our mco discounts for the foreseeable future and  therefore  do not expect significant changes to our mco discount estimates in future periods 
chargebacks and gpo contract discounts we have entered into agreements with certain gpos in which their members can purchase product from our wholesalers at a specified price 
gpos are organizations that represent a group of end buyers in the purchase of goods 
these agreements involve the wholesalers who receive a stated margin on sales to gpos 
when the difference between the wholesaler s purchase price and the gpo s price creates a margin less than the amount agreed between us and the wholesaler  the wholesaler requests a credit  which is referred to as a chargeback 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
we estimate eligible sales based on a history of the average actual chargebacks and an average of the chargeback cycle time  which is the time from when a wholesaler sells to a gpo until we issue a credit to the wholesaler 
we examine the history of sales which qualify for chargebacks and monitor sales trends and contractual changes 
our accrual consists of the amount expected to be incurred for the current sales in the calculated chargeback cycle  plus an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
the provision for chargebacks and gpo contract credits was approximately and of gross sales in and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in xopenex hfa units sold under a government contract with the veterans administration in as compared to actual chargeback and gpo contract credits could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
however  over the past few years  chargeback activity has been fairly stable with the exception of xopenex hfa  which currently has a limited number of chargeback contracts 
therefore  we do not expect significant variation between actual chargeback and gpo credits and our estimates 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our returned goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for xopenex inhalation solution is months  xopenex hfa is months  lunesta is months and brovana is months 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
customers can return product with six months or less of shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
we record an estimate for returns as reductions of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
we base our estimates of product returns on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically  on a historical aging of the average time a return occurs from the time the product was sold and on key analytical measures such as the percentage of the outstanding pipeline covered by the returns reserve 
for products with insufficient return history  we estimate by examining data of similar drugs 
for example  with lunesta  we researched industry data on return patterns of widely prescribed insomnia drugs 
we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could significantly impact our expected return percentages 
these factors include our estimate of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  the product shelf life of the product we have shipped  competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
the provision for returns was approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in return percentage provision in from is primarily due to a higher rate of return of xopenex inhalation solution as a result cms decision to discontinue the stand alone reimbursement for the product and also higher returns of lunesta  primarily in the mg tablets and all hospital units doses 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
based on these factors  and as a result of fluctuations observed in prior periods  we believe it is reasonably likely that the actual returns provision percentage could vary from the estimated percentage within a range of up to 
if the returns provision percentage for each of these products had increased by of gross sales in  an additional provision of approximately million would have been necessary 
many of our accruals include an estimate of inventory in the distribution pipeline 
at december   we believe a reasonable estimate of the value of our pipeline inventory in gross sales dollars is approximately million for xopenex inhalation solution  million for xopenex hfa  million for lunesta and million for brovana 
other discounts at times we offer special programs and discounts 
in  we implemented a patient assistance program  which provides all our products at no cost to those eligible patients who lack prescription drug coverage and are unable to afford them in and  we utilized discount programs related to lunesta and xopenex hfa to support the goal of making the products widely available 
in  our coupon and voucher utilization increased as compared to  which is largely the result of an increase in our coupon programs related to xopenex hfa 
these programs include coupons and vouchers  including the lunesta night challenge introduced in september under the coupon program  physicians give patients coupons to purchase the prescribed drug at a discount from any retail pharmacy 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for these discounts through a third party administrator 
under the voucher and lunesta night challenge programs  physicians give patients vouchers to obtain free samples of the prescribed drug from any retail pharmacy 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we use the voucher program primarily in states where samples cannot be shipped directly to physicians 
in each case mentioned above  we estimate the cost of reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when the product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons and vouchers based on outstanding total coupons and vouchers and their historical usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such historical usage rate occurs 
each of these programs has a defined expiration date

short and long term investments short and long term investments include us government securities  certificates of deposit  corporate commercial paper  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  equity securities and auction rate securities 
those investments with a maturity of less than one year are classified as short term 
short and long term investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
at acquisition  we designate the appropriate classification of the investment purchased based upon its intended holding period 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
although auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days  the contractual maturities can be well in excess of ten years  and are therefore classified as  long term investments 
available for sale investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses for securities classified as available for sale are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
held to maturity investments are recorded at cost plus accrued amortization  which approximates fair value 
we evaluate our investments for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the investment rating for the securities  the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
if it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the security exceeds the estimated fair market value 
accounts receivable and bad debt our trade receivables in and primarily represent amounts due to us from wholesalers  distributors and retailers of our pharmaceutical products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
bad debt write offs were not significant in  and  however  they could be significant in the future and we monitor our receivables closely because a few customers make up a large portion of our overall revenues 
in both and  our top four customers accounted for approximately respectively  of our total revenues 
amortization  depreciation and certain long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized  maintenance and repairs  which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets  are charged to operations 
on disposal  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations as other income expense 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
computers and software  which are recorded in office equipment  have estimated useful lives of three years 
all laboratory  manufacturing and office equipment have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
buildings have an estimated useful life of years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining term of the lease 
deferred financing costs deferred financing costs relating to expenses incurred to complete convertible subordinated debt offerings are amortized evenly over the earlier of the term of the debt  or the date on which we can first be obligated to repurchase all or part of the debt 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on management s review of both positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the possible adverse impact to our xopenex inhalation solution sales if an at risk generic launch were to occur or we are unable to successfully defend our patent rights and increased sales and marketing expenses as a result of the expected commercial introduction of omnaris aq in the first half of and the expected commercial introduction alvesco hfa in the second half of  management continues to conclude a valuation allowance is required for the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
of our total valuation allowance of million  approximately million relates to stock option compensation deductions 
the tax benefit associated with the stock option compensation deductions will be credited to equity if realized 
if in the future  we determine based on expected profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
such release of the valuation allowance could occur within the next months upon resolution of the aforementioned uncertainties 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
we also recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
inventory write downs inventory represents bulk material  work in process and finished goods relating to our commercial products on hand  valued at lower of cost or market value 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical  and through a review of the expiration dates 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would write down the value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
we expense costs relating to inventory as research and development expense until such time as we receive an approval letter from the fda for a new product  and then we begin to capitalize the inventory costs relating to that product 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  which resulted in changes to our financial statements as detailed in note b and note o to the financial statements 
determining the amount and distribution of expense for stock based compensation  as well as the associated impact to the balance sheets and statements of cash flows  requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
this valuation model takes into account the exercise price of the award  as well as a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected term  the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term  the risk free interest rate over the expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we based the expected volatility of our stock on the historical price of our common stock 
upon our adoption of sfas r in january  we began utilizing implied volatility  derived from our traded options  to determine the volatility of our stock 
as required by sfas r  management has also made an estimate of expected forfeitures in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  and is recognizing compensation expense only for those equity awards expected to vest 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation expenses 
these estimates are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards 
research and development expenses we expense internal and external research and development costs  including costs of funded research and development arrangements  in the period incurred 
we also expense the cost of purchased technology in the period of purchase if we believe that the technology has not demonstrated technological feasibility and that it does not have an alternative future use

we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on any non financial assets and liabilities or on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and general corporate expenses 
historically  we have funded these requirements and the growth of our business primarily through convertible subordinated debt offerings  the issuance of common stock  including the exercise of stock options  sales of our products and license agreements for our drug compounds 
we now expect to fund our liquidity requirements primarily with revenue generated from product sales 
we also believe we have the ability to meet our short term liquidity needs through the use of our cash and short term investments on hand at december  cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments totaled billion  or of total assets at december   compared to billion  or of total assets  at december  at december   our portfolio included million invested in highly rated aaa student loan backed auction rate securities  of which some are associated with failed auctions in the funds associated with our auction rate securities that have failed auction may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the security is called  or the underlying securities have matured 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  which includes net income of million 
our net income includes non cash charges of million  consisting primarily of share based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense 
accounts receivable decreased by million primarily due to lunesta and xopenex inhalation solution sales 
inventory increased by million primarily due to an effort to increase the number of days of on hand inventory of xopenex hfa 
other assets increased by million primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and royalty receivables off set by a decline in interest receivable 
accounts payable increased by million primarily due to timing of vendor payments 
accrued expenses increased by million primarily due to the recording of the million upfront payment we paid to bial in january  increased accrued sales and marketing and accrued research and development expenses as a result of timing of vendor payments  and a decline in accrued interest as a result of the february payment in full of our convertible subordinated debentures 
other liabilities increased by million primarily due to accruals associated with the restructuring and realignment of our sales force 
product sales allowances and reserves increased million primarily due to product revenue rebates related to lunesta and xopenex inhalation solutions product sales 
deferred revenue increased million primarily relating to licensing agreements with eisai and gsk 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
as a result of liquidating certain securities into cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by net sales of short and long term investments was million 
we made purchases of property and equipment of million and received proceeds from sales of equipment of  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we received proceeds of million from issuing common stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under our stock option plans 
we also used million to repay capital lease obligations and long term debt 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and the cash flow we anticipate from operations and current strategic alliances will be sufficient to support existing operations through at least the end of in the longer term  we expect to continue to fund our operations with revenue generated from product sales 
our actual future cash requirements and our ability to generate revenue  however  will depend on many factors  including lunesta sales  xopenex inhalation solution and xopenex hfa sales  brovana sales  successful commercialization of omnaris aq and alvesco hfa  successful acquisition of technologies  product candidates  approved products and or businesses  successful expansion into foreign markets  our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements  whether our debt  particularly debt due in  will be paid in cash rather than converted into common stock pursuant to the terms of such debt  progress of our preclinical and clinical research programs and the number and breadth of these programs  progress of our development efforts and the development efforts of our strategic partners  achievement of milestones under our strategic alliance arrangements  royalties from agreements with parties to which we have licensed our technology  and the outcome of pending litigation  including litigation related to generic competition and or any possible future litigation or the at risk launch of generic versions of our product 
if our assumptions underlying our beliefs regarding future revenues and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling debt or equity securities or borrowing money from a bank 
however  we may not be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that we will not be required to raise additional capital to fund the repayment of our outstanding convertible debt when due  however we may choose to do so 
if we are not able to successfully grow our revenue and properly manage our expenses  it is likely that our business would be materially and adversely affected and that we would be required to raise additional funds in order to repay our outstanding convertible debt 
we cannot assure that  if required  we would be able to raise the additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
acquisition strategy in january  we entered into an agreement with nycomed for the exclusive us distribution  development and commercialization in the united states  its territories and possessions of nycomed s compound ciclesonide  and products incorporating such compound 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with bial for the development and commercialization in the united states and canada of bial s anti epileptic compound  bia  which we now refer to as sep we paid nycomed an upfront payment of million in february and may be required to make subsequent payments of up to million over the life of the agreement upon accomplishment of various development and sales milestones 
we paid bial an upfront payment of million and are required to make subsequent payments upon accomplishment of various development and regulatory milestones  which could include up to an additional million if all milestones are met 
we utilized cash in early to make the upfront payments to nycomed and bial 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to continue to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  approved products  product candidates and or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate these acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds and or issue shares of our capital stock in the future to consummate these transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for acquisitions and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closing costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
convertible subordinated debt in february  we paid in full million of outstanding convertible debentures  which matured on february   plus approximately million in accrued interest 
the million of debentures were convertible into our common stock  at the option of the holder  at a price of per share  and the interest was paid semi annually  commencing on august  as part of the sale of the debentures  we incurred approximately million of offering costs  which were recorded as intangible assets and were amortized over seven years  the term of the debentures 
in january and december  we issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes including million principal amount of series a convertible senior subordinated notes due  or series a notes  due  and million principal amount of series b convertible senior subordinated notes due  or series b notes due note holders may convert the series a notes due into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and the series b notes due into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in each case  the conversion price is subject to adjustment  at any time before close of business on december   in the case of the series a notes due  or december   in the case of the series b notes due we may not redeem the notes prior to maturity 
the net proceeds to us after offering costs were approximately million 
during september  certain holders of our series a notes due and series b notes due  agreed  in separately negotiated transactions  to convert million and million in aggregate principal amount of their series a notes due and series b notes due  respectively  into an aggregate of  and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
as an inducement to convert their notes  we paid the holders of the series a notes due and series b notes due aggregate cash payments of million and million  respectively 
at december   million and million of the series a notes due and series b notes due  respectively  remained outstanding 
in december  we used approximately million of the proceeds from the issuance of series a convertible senior subordinated notes due and series b convertible senior subordinated notes due to purchase four series of call spread options on our common stock expiring at various dates between may  and december  the call spread options  which are now completed  could have been settled at our option in either net shares or in cash 
during the second and fourth quarters of  we settled series one and two for cash resulting in payments to us in the amount of million 
the first series of settled options expired at various dates beginning on may  and ending on june  and the second series of options expired at various dates beginning on november  and ending on december  during the second quarter of  the third series of settled options expired at various dates beginning on may  and ending on june  we settled the third series for cash resulting in a payment to us in the amount of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the fourth and final series expired in equal installments on each business day from november  through december  we elected to settle the fourth series in net shares for which we received  shares of our common stock  which we currently hold as treasury stock 
in september  we issued million in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due  or notes due the notes due are convertible  at the option of the holder upon certain specified circumstances  into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock at an initial price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the note holders may  at their election  require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the notes on october   and at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of any notes repurchased 
we may also be required to repurchase for cash all or part of the notes upon a change in control or if our stock is no longer traded on nasdaq or a similar market at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of any notes repurchased  plus in certain change in control circumstances an additional make whole payment 
on or after october   we have the option to redeem for cash all or part of the notes at any time at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed 
in order to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future payments due at maturity  we may  from time to time  depending on market conditions  repurchase additional outstanding convertible debt for cash  exchange debt for shares of our common stock  warrants  preferred stock  debt or other considerations  or otherwise extinguish debt through a combination of any of the foregoing 
if we exchange shares of our capital stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock  for outstanding convertible debt  the number of shares that we might issue as a result of such exchanges could significantly exceed the number of shares originally issuable upon conversion of such debt and  accordingly  such exchanges could result in material dilution to holders of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will repurchase or exchange any additional outstanding convertible debt 
biosphere biosphere was a consolidated subsidiary from through july  as a result of a public offering of biosphere common stock in  our ownership of biosphere was reduced from approximately to 
therefore  effective july   we changed the method of accounting for our investment in biosphere from consolidating the results of biosphere operations to the equity method 
on november   we purchased  in a private placement   shares of biosphere series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of biosphere common stock from biosphere for an aggregate purchase price of million 
each share of biosphere series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of biosphere common stock 
in addition  quarterly dividends of per annum are paid on the shares in either cash or additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock  at biosphere s election and  as of december   we had acquired an additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock in connection with dividend payments 
at december  and  we owned  shares  or approximately of biosphere s outstanding common stock 
the fair market value of those shares was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and we owned  and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively  and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
assuming conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise of our warrants  we would own approximately of biosphere s common stock as of december  we have recorded   and  as our share of biosphere losses for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment  including contingencies related to potential future development  financing and or commercial milestone payments on collaboration agreements 
the following chart summarizes our material contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total and beyond in thousands convertible subordinated debt principal   capital lease obligations    operating leases      purchase obligations    total material contractual cash obligations   if the convertible subordinated debt were converted into common stock  these amounts would no longer be a contractual cash obligation 
operating leases includes our leased facilities obligations 
purchase obligations relate to research and development commitments for new and existing products and open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced or eliminated based on certain future events 
in addition to the material contractual cash obligations included in this chart  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  distribution and development agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
for example  nycomed and bial may become entitled to receive subsequent payments of up to million and million  respectively  if all milestones are met 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probably nor reasonably estimable  such contingent payments have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in this chart 
in addition  pursuant to our exclusive us distribution agreement with nycomed  we paid nycomed an upfront payment of million in february  which is also not reflected in this chart 
this table also excludes any liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
we have had no material related party activities in or  other than those relating to the purchase of biosphere series a convertible preferred stock and warrants 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases in the normal course of business  or variable interest entities or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and equity prices  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  money market funds  and short term investments with original maturities of three months or less 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
due to the conservative nature and relatively short duration of our investments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
however  in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates  negatively impacting future investment income 
our short and long term investments consist of us government securities  certificates of deposits  corporate commercial paper  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  equity securities and auction rate securities 
although  auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
our long term investments as of december  was million which includes million invested in highly rated aaa student loan backed auction rate securities  of which some are associated with failed auctions in the funds associated with our auction rate securities that have failed auction may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the security is called  or the underlying securities have matured 
additionally  the failure causes the interest rate on these investments to reset to a premium interest rate  resulting in favorable future investment income 
if the credit rating of the issuer of any auction rate security held by us deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
although our investments are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and our investment portfolio is monitored for compliance with our investment policy 
the primary objective of the investment policy is the preservation of capital 
due to the conservative nature and relatively short duration of our overall investments portfolio  credit and interest rate risk is mitigated 
the interest rates on our convertible subordinated debt and capital lease obligations are fixed and  therefore  not subject to interest rate risk 
equity prices our convertible subordinated debt is sensitive to fluctuations in the price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt due to the difference between the current market price of the debt and the market price at the date of issuance of the debt 
at december   a decrease in the price of our common stock could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million on the net fair value of our convertible subordinated debt 
additionally  we have a cost investment in the equity securities of acadia with a market value of million at december  a decrease in the equity prices of these securities would result in a decrease of approximately million in our investments
