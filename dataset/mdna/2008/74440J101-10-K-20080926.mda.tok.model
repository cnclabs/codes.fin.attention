table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes there to appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a drug delivery company committed to the biomedical sector  with a primary focus on ophthalmology and oncology 
we have two products approved by the fda retisert for the treatment of uveitis and vitrasert for the treatment of aids related cmv retinitis 
we have licensed both of these products and the technologies underlying them to bausch lomb 
we have one product in fully recruited phase iii clinical trials iluvien  which delivers fa for the treatment of diabetic macular edema dme  formerly known as medidur fa for dme 
we have licensed certain of our drug delivery technology to alimera for the development of iluvien and certain other ophthalmic products 
we have a worldwide collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer under which pfizer may develop additional ophthalmic products 
we own the rights to develop and commercialize a modified form of silicon known as biosilicon  which has potential therapeutic applications 
our most advanced biosilicon product candidate  brachysil  delivers a therapeutic p  a radioactive form of phosphorus used to treat cancer  directly to solid tumors 
we recently completed an initial safety and efficacy clinical trial of brachysil for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and have commenced a dose ranging clinical trial 
in july  we completed a sale of  units at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of i one common share  and ii one warrant to purchase common share  with a warrant exercise price of per share 
of the total offering   units were purchased by pfizer in accordance with the terms of the collaborative research and license agreement dated april  a total of  warrants  with a warrant exercise price of per share  were issued to the placement agents in connection with the offering 
in addition  we simultaneously completed a sale of common shares and warrants at the equivalent price of a per unit under the same terms and conditions noted above 
this sale of  units resulted in additional gross proceeds of approximately million 
aggregate share issue costs for these transactions totaled approximately million 
in january we announced the results of our initial clinical study of brachysil for the treatment of advanced  inoperable pancreatic cancer 
the trial  designed as a safety study  indicated that brachysil  in combination with standard chemotherapy  was well tolerated with no clinically significant adverse events related to brachysil 
in july  we commenced a dose ranging trial 
on march   we amended and restated our license and collaboration agreement with alimera 
in exchange for current and future consideration of up to approximately million  we agreed to a share in the future profits of iluvien and any other licensed products developed under the amended collaboration agreement 
current consideration consisted of i million in cash received upon the execution of the amended collaboration agreement and ii cancellation of million of accrued development cost liabilities  including related penalties and accrued interest  owed by us to alimera as of march  other consideration  exclusive of our profit share  includes i conditional principal and interest payments of up to approximately million through september under a note issued by alimera  ii a million milestone payment upon fda approval of iluvien for the treatment of dme  iii reimbursement of approved development costs we incur in support of the ongoing clinical studies of iluvien for the treatment of dme and anticipated regulatory submissions  and iv assumption by alimera of all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products under the collaboration agreement  which will result in the elimination of an estimated million of development cost obligations that would otherwise have been payable by us to alimera during the period from april through the completion of the development process under the original collaboration agreement

summary of critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions  which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and are based upon the information available at the time  cannot be made with certainty 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions may change as new events occur or as additional information is obtained  and actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  management has identified certain of these accounting policies to be critical to aid in a full understanding and evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  and our procedures relating to these policies  require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for license agreements we have entered into collaborative license and development arrangements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of products utilizing our technologies 
the terms of these agreements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
we follow the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
with the exception of royalties  these types of consideration are classified as collaborative research and development revenue in our statements of operations when revenue recognition is appropriate 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair 
table of contents value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
for arrangements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  total payments under the arrangement are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
the cumulative amount of revenue earned is limited to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
deferred revenue amounts are classified as current liabilities to the extent that revenue is expected to be recognized within one year 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
amended and restated collaboration agreement with alimera as discussed in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we entered into an amended collaboration agreement with alimera on march  the terms and conditions of this amendment required an assessment of the expected term of the agreement and our obligations thereunder 
pursuant to eitf  we evaluated our obligations under the amended agreement and concluded that  since each deliverable did not have a determinable fair value to the licensee on a standalone basis  such deliverables represented a single unit of accounting 
we further determined that all of our consequential development obligations under the amended agreement would cease no later than december  accordingly  commencing on the effective date of the amended agreement  we will amortize the aggregate million deferred revenue balance that existed at that date on a straight line basis over the month performance period 
the million deferred revenue balance consisted of i a million payment received upon the execution of the amended agreement  ii cancellation of approximately million of accrued development costs  including related penalties and accrued interest  owed by us to alimera as of march   and iii  of previously received but unamortized milestone payments 
all future payments received from alimera during the designated performance period will be recognized as revenue using the cumulative catch up method 
under this method  the portion of any such payment represented by the time elapsed from the amendment effective date to the payment date as a percentage of the month performance period will be recognized immediately as revenue  with the remainder amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
all payments received from alimera following the end of the performance period will be recognized as revenue when earned 
pfizer collaborative research and license agreement on april   we and pfizer entered into a collaborative research and license agreement the pfizer agreement which superseded a prior research agreement dated december  under the pfizer agreement  the parties have implemented a joint research program aimed at developing certain ophthalmic products using our durasert drug delivery technology 
in addition to potential development and sales related milestone payments  pfizer pays us a minimum of  per quarter  which commenced in calendar year  in consideration of our costs in performing the research program  and continues until the commencement of a phase iii clinical trial for the first licensed product candidate or until the agreement is earlier terminated 

table of contents the two pfizer agreements have been combined for accounting purposes and  following an evaluation of the multiple deliverables in accordance with the provisions of eitf  we concluded that there was a single unit of accounting 
we are evaluating the timing of the deliverables and other obligations under the pfizer agreement and  as a result  all payments received through june  from pfizer totaling million have been recorded as deferred revenue 
intangible assets and goodwill impairment of intangible assets we review our intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be recoverable 
at december  and at june   we identified triggering events that required in depth assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our retisert and brachysil intangible assets 
the valuation assessment required detailed analysis of projected future cash inflows and cash outflows associated with each intangible asset 
these projections required the application of numerous judgments 
in the case of retisert  a commercialized product with two years of sales history  these judgments and estimates included market penetration rates  estimated market growth  potential impact of new technologies under development  penetration rate for re implants and appropriate weighted average cost of capital rate to discount the future cash flows 
in the case of brachysil  a product candidate then in phase iia clinical trials  other estimates included the cost and duration of later stage clinical trials  timing of regulatory approval and the probability of a collaboration agreement with a third party 
at june   we recorded an impairment write down of million in connection with our retisert patents 
no impairment write downs were required at december  in connection with the goodwill impairment analysis at june   we determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows associated with each of the company s intangible assets exceeded its carrying value  and therefore no impairment of intangible assets was recorded at june  these projections required the application of numerous judgments  including future growth rates 
if there are future triggering events  we may be required to record additional impairment write downs against the million carrying value at june  of our intangible assets goodwill impairment 
in performing the goodwill impairment testing  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 
we calculate our goodwill valuation using a combination of the income and market approaches 
these methods incorporate many assumptions including future growth rates  discount factors and income tax rates 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we test goodwill as of june each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
when conducting an annual goodwill impairment test  we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents during fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
there were no goodwill impairment charges during fiscal and accounting for convertible notes we financed our activities partially through the issuance of convertible notes with detachable warrants in november and september to institutional investors 
these compound instruments require analysis of their component parts and appropriate classification as liabilities and equity 
we concluded that the note holder conversion option was an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and classification as a derivative liability subject to fair value adjustment through the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative was estimated using the binomial tree model  taking into account assumptions as to share price volatility  dividend yield and market interest rates for a comparable non convertible debt instrument 
the initial carrying value of a convertible note liability is determined by first subtracting from the gross proceeds the relative fair value of any equity component and then subtracting the fair value of any compound embedded derivatives 
the effective interest method is used to amortize to finance costs the debt discount over the expected life of the financial liability  or such shorter period as may be deemed appropriate 
debt issue costs are recorded as an asset and similarly amortized to finance costs over the life of the financial liability 
during the year ended june   we entered into multiple amendments of the terms of the sandell convertible note 
for each amendment  we estimated the present value of the future cash flows of the amended note  including cash and non cash consideration  against that of the pre amendment note 
if the resulting present values reflected a change of greater than  the pre amendment note was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and the amended note as the issuance of a new compound debt instrument 
alternatively  if the resulting present values reflected a change of less than  the amendment was treated as a modification of the original debt instrument 
as more fully described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  during the year ended june   we entered into three amendments of our sandell convertible note  two of which were recorded as an extinguishment of the prior debt instrument and one of which was treated as a debt modification 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses impairment of goodwill   na impairment of intangible assets   na research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations other income expense change in fair value of derivative interest income interest and finance costs loss on extinguishment of debt   na other income  net total other income expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations   na gain on sale of discontinued operations   na income from discontinued operations net loss na not applicable revenue revenue increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended june  from approximately million for the year ended june  collaborative research and development revenues increased by million  principally due to revenue recognized in connection with the march amended collaboration agreement with alimera 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in retisert royalties payable to us 
on march   we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with alimera dated february pursuant to the amended collaboration agreement  a total of million of deferred revenue at that date is being recognized ratably over a period of months from the effective date of the amendment through december   which represents the period of our performance obligations 
additional cash consideration received by us from alimera during the period from the amendment effective date through december  will also be recognized ratably over the performance period  including immediate revenue recognition catch up for the pro rata period from the amendment effective date to the date of receipt 
for the year ending june   the company expects to record collaborative development revenue of at least million related to the amended collaboration agreement 
pursuant to an advance royalty agreement dated june  cds received million from bausch lomb as an advance payment in lieu of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would be payable 
table of contents under our license agreement with bausch lomb 
bausch lomb was entitled to retain of the first million of royalties otherwise payable  or million  and of the next million of royalties otherwise payable 
thereafter  we are entitled to receive of the royalties to which we are otherwise entitled under the license agreement 
the following table summarizes the applicable royalty amounts for the period from inception july  through june  and the future effect of this agreement prospectively from that date royalties otherwise payable under the license agreement net royalty amounts payable under the amended license agreement in thousands for the six months ended december  for the six months ended june  for the year ended june  for the year ended june  from inception through june  for the period from july  until such time as cumulative royalties otherwise payable under the license agreement total million total represents the period prior to our acquisition of cds  which closed on december  represents the retisert royalties included as revenue in our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  represents of  of royalties otherwise payable and of  of royalties otherwise payable as of june   bausch lomb is entitled to retain an additional million of future retisert royalties otherwise payable to the company 
accordingly  we currently do not expect to receive any retisert royalty income from bausch lomb until at least the fiscal year ending june  impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual evaluation of goodwill under the terms and provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company recognized an impairment charge equal to the total carrying value of goodwill of million for the year ended june  the goodwill impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit with the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets totaled million for the year ended june  in july  we received formal confirmation of our prior understanding from industry sources that bausch lomb had withdrawn its european application for authorization to market retisert 
as a result  we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the retisert patents at june  see note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and determined that the value of such patents was million 

table of contents research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors a net decrease of approximately million in amortization of intangibles  primarily resulting from the million impairment of our retisert patents at june  and  to a lesser extent  the effect of an increase in the estimated useful life of the brachysil patents as of december   and a decrease of approximately million in uk and singapore based operating expenses as a result of i significant head count reductions in the u 
k in fiscal year  ii reduced levels of clinical trial program activities  and iii reduced depreciation expense principally related to a clean room facility that was fully depreciated as of march  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in co development costs related to the phase iii clinical trial of the iluvien product candidate through the march  effective date of our amended collaboration agreement with alimera 
pursuant to the terms of the amended collaboration agreement  alimera assumed complete financial responsibility for the ongoing phase iii clinical trial and other regulatory activities related to iluvien 
as a result  in future periods we do not expect to incur co development costs for iluvien  which totaled approximately million for the year ended june  general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june   primarily as the result of an increase of approximately million of legal  audit and professional fees and other transactional costs incurred during the year ended june  due to the reincorporation 
change in fair value of derivative change in fair value of derivative decreased by approximately million  or  to income of million for the year ended june  from income of million for the year ended june  during the years ended june  and  we recorded the value of detachable warrants issued in share offerings denominated in australian dollars a as a derivative liability  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivative related to these warrants resulted in income of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively  primarily attributable to a net decrease in the market price of our shares during the periods 
we recorded derivative liabilities in connection with the conversion option feature of our convertible note issued in november  as amended  and our convertible notes issued in september these derivative liabilities were revalued at market from inception until the notes were redeemed 
the change in fair value of these derivative liabilities through the redemption of the convertible notes in may and june resulted in income of million for the year ended june  interest income interest income increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   primarily due to increased levels of interest bearing cash balances resulting from a july share offering and the initial million cash consideration received in march in connection with the amended collaboration agreement with alimera and an increase of approximately  of interest accrued on a note receivable 

table of contents interest and finance costs interest and finance costs decreased by approximately million  or  to  for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this decrease was attributable to a decrease of million in interest expense primarily as the result of the redemption of our convertible notes that were redeemed in may and june  the absence of million of amortization of debt discount and issue costs in connection with our convertible notes  and the absence of million of registration rights penalties incurred in fiscal year in connection with our convertible note agreements 
pursuant to the march  amendment to our collaboration agreement with alimera  alimera agreed to assume sole financial responsibility for the development of iluvien  and all previously deferred co development cost amounts  related penalties and compound annual interest charged on the foregoing  that we owed to alimera were deemed to have been paid 
we therefore do not expect to incur any future interest charges on iluvien development costs 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt totaled million for the year ended june  in each of september and december  we amended the terms of the convertible promissory note originally issued to sandell in november the terms of each such amendment required us to account for the amendment as an extinguishment of the original note and the issuance of a new debt instrument 
in may  we redeemed the sandell note by a single payment of million  and in june  we redeemed the absolute notes by aggregate payments of  in connection with each of the sandell amendments and the final sandell redemption  we issued warrants that were treated as additional consideration paid by us to sandell in the extinguishment transactions 
these warrants  valued using the binomial tree method  accounted for million of the total loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended june  other income  net other income  net increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  this increase consisted primarily of  of income in attributable to a revenue sharing arrangement with the provider of our predecessor s adr program  partially offset by a  net unfavorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased by approximately million  or  to  for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that in fiscal our ability to record tax benefits associated with losses incurred was limited by the amount of deferred tax liabilities recorded 
since june   we have been required to establish valuation allowances to offset the tax benefit of all net operating loss carryforwards due to uncertainty that we will be able to use these carryforwards 
loss from discontinued operations in april  we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in connection with the sale of the stock of our aion diagnostics subsidiary 
proceeds consisted of approximately million in cash and a million unsecured promissory note  bearing interest compounded monthly 
the promissory note was due april  but has not yet been paid and is overdue see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
loss from discontinued operations in fiscal through the date of sale was million

the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in retisert royalty income from bausch lomb 
impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets totaled approximately million for the year ended june  the impairment was attributable to a write down of the carrying value of our retisert patents as a result of a triggering event that required us to assess the recoverability of such carrying value at june  see note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
at june   the remaining carrying values of the company s intangible assets were million for retisert and million for brachysil 
ipr d in connection with the acquisition of cds on december   approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to the iluvien product candidate in phase iii clinical trials and was immediately charged to operations in the year ended june  
table of contents research and development research and development increased by  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors a net increase of approximately million in amortization of intangibles  primarily due to the effect of a full year of amortization of the retisert patents which were amortized during the prior year only from the december  acquisition date of cds  and an increase of approximately million due to the effect of a full year of the research operations of psivida us formerly cds  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in uk and singapore based operating expenses as a result of i significant head count reductions in the uk  ii reduced levels of clinical trial program activities  and iii reduced depreciation expense related to a clean room facility that was fully depreciated as of march  and a net decrease of approximately  in share based payments expense  primarily related to options that fully vested in general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors an increase of approximately million of personnel  occupancy and operating costs for psivida us  primarily because the current period costs reflect a full year of operations compared to six months of operations for the prior year  and an increase of approximately million of professional fees in connection with us statutory filings  registration statement filings in connection with convertible note transactions and amendments thereto  the negotiation of license agreements and evaluation of potential financing sources  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  of share based payments expense primarily attributable to options that fully vested during the year ended june  change in fair value of derivative change in fair value of derivative increased by approximately million  or  to income of million for the year ended june  from income of million for the year ended june  we recorded derivative liabilities in connection with the embedded conversion option feature of our convertible note issued to sandell in november  as amended  and of our convertible notes issued to absolute in september these derivative liabilities were revalued at market from inception until the notes were redeemed in may and june  respectively 
the change in fair value of derivative related to the convertible note transactions resulted in income of million and million in the years ended june  and  respectively 
in connection with several capital raising transactions during the year ended june   we issued shares together with detachable warrants to purchase additional shares over a specified time period 
to the extent that the warrants were denominated in a  which is different than our us functional currency  the value of the options were recorded as a derivative liability  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivative related to these investor options resulted in income during the period of million  primarily attributable to a net decrease in the market price of the company s shares during the period 

table of contents interest income interest income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to reduced levels of interest bearing cash balances 
interest and finance costs interest and finance costs increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was attributable to an increase of million in interest expense  of which  was related to interest on our convertible note transactions and  was related to interest accrued on the portion of iluvien development costs for which we deferred payment under the terms of the original february collaboration agreement with alimera  an increase of million in the amortization of debt discount and issue costs in connection with our convertible note transactions  and an increase of million of registration rights penalties predominantly related to delayed compliance with the registration rights obligations that we incurred in connection with our convertible note agreements 
as of june   we redeemed all of the outstanding convertible note balances 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt totaled million for the year ended june  in each of september and december  we amended the terms of the convertible promissory note originally issued to sandell in november the terms of each of those amendments required us to account for the transaction as an extinguishment of the original note and the issuance of a new debt instrument 
in may we redeemed the sandell note by a single payment of million  and in june  we redeemed the absolute notes by payments of  in connection with each of the sandell amendments and the final sandell redemption  we issued warrants that were treated as additional consideration paid by us to sandell in the extinguishment transactions 
these warrants  valued using the binomial tree method  accounted for million of the total loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended june  other income  net other income  net decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized foreign exchange gains on cash balances held in currencies other than our us functional currency  partially offset by the strengthening of the a against the us 
during the year ended june   as we began the process of centralizing our accounting and finance functions in the us  excess cash balances were primarily maintained in the us denominated in us 
in addition  during the year ended june   we recorded an expense of  to reverse income recorded in the prior year related to amortization of deferred gain resulting from a sale and leaseback transaction entered into by cds in in relation to its premises 
during fiscal  we concluded that the deferred gain attributable to the sale and leaseback should not have been included in the us gaap purchase price allocation for the acquisition of cds see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit deferred income tax benefit increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to the larger pre tax loss in fiscal 
table of contents loss from discontinued operations in april  we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in connection with the sale of our stock in our aion diagnostics subsidiary 
loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to approximately nine months of aion operations during fiscal compared to a full year in fiscal inflation and seasonality our management believes inflation has not had a material impact on our operations or financial condition and that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  for purposes such as derivative valuation and impairment analysis  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  pursuant to fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  issued in february  the application of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in financial statements on a recurring basis may be deferred until fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the implications of sfas  but do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

the guidance in sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
sfas encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we are assessing the potential impact of sfas in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas the objective of fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas revised and other accounting principles 
fsp applies to all intangible assets  whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise  and early adoption is prohibited 
we will be required to adopt fsp for our fiscal year beginning july  we are evaluating the potential impact of adopting fsp on our consolidated financial statements liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
our research and development and general and administrative costs  in the aggregate  have exceeded our revenues  including revenues related to our two commercialized products  and  accordingly  our operations have historically generated negative cash flows 
we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis at least until such time as one or more of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval and commences commercial sales 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on sales of our equity and debt securities and the proceeds from license fees and collaboration payments to fund our operations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at june  compared to million at june  in addition to our amended collaboration agreement with alimera  which generated million in cash during fiscal year see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  in july we completed a share offering pursuant to which we issued  common shares for net cash proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents we believe we can fund our operations as currently conducted through at least june  this expectation is based on the assumptions that we continue to receive the pfizer quarterly  research and development funding  alimera continues to fund the development of iluvien  we resume receiving retisert royalties from bausch lomb during the fiscal year ending june  and we receive the scheduled conditional note payments from alimera 
however  whether and when we will require additional capital will depend upon many other factors  including  but not limited to the continuation of our existing collaborations with pfizer and alimera  including their continued funding of our programs and our receipt of milestone  royalty  note and other payments  the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of iluvien  which is our primary product candidate currently in development  the amount and timing of sales of retisert  which affect the timing of the resumption of retisert royalty payments and the amount of such royalty payments  the scope and extent of our internally funded operations  including our programs for brachysil including any phase iii clinical trials for brachysil for pancreatic cancer  any new product candidates  or any new business opportunities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements for brachysil or any other product candidates for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the success of our products and product candidates  including the timing and costs of regulatory approvals and the commercial success of approved products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and changes in our operating plan  including the pursuit of new business opportunities  which may affect our need for capital 
in particular  our future cash position depends significantly on the approval and marketing of iluvien and the occurrence of certain liquidity events under the terms of our amended collaboration agreement with alimera 
alimera has agreed to pay us a million payment upon fda approval of iluvien and a share in the future profits of iluvien 
in addition  the million note issued by alimera becomes due and payable upon the occurrence of certain defined liquidity events such as an initial public offering that result in aggregate proceeds to alimera in excess of million 
there is no assurance that the fda will approve iluvien or that iluivien will achieve market acceptance even if it is approved by the fda 
there is similarly no guarantee of the occurrence of a liquidity event resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to alimera in excess of million 
if we require additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms including requiring us to relinquish rights to our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  postpone the pursuit of product candidates and new business opportunities  or otherwise reduce our cash requirements 
cash to fund working capital requirements is managed centrally  with most cash deposits maintained in us dollars

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to changes in the valuation of derivative liabilities  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative liabilities the change in fair value of derivatives related to liabilities for investor warrants denominated in a resulted in income of approximately million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively  and was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
our financial position and results of operations will be sensitive to future revaluations of these derivative liabilities 
the primary factor that impacts the change in fair value of these derivatives is fluctuations in our share price 
reduction of the remaining useful life of the warrants  assuming that share price remains constant  will result in a modest decrease of the derivative liability value 
changes in risk free interest rates have a de minimis effect
