item business overview in this document  cbeyond  inc and its subsidiaries are referred to as we  the company or cbeyond 
we provide managed internet protocol based  or ip based  communications services to our target market of small businesses in select large metropolitan areas across the united states 
our services include local and long distance voice services  broadband internet access  mobile voice and data  email  voicemail  web hosting  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  virtual private network  and other communications and it services 
in january  we began offering mobile voice and data services in conjunction with our landline based services via our mobile virtual network operator  or mvno  relationship with a nationwide wireless network provider 

table of contents our voice services other than our mobile voice and data services are delivered using voice over ip  or voip  technology and all of such services are delivered over our secure all ip network  rather than over the best efforts public internet 
our network allows us to manage quality of service and achieve network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional phone networks 
we believe our all ip network platform enables us to deliver an integrated bundle of communications services that may otherwise be unaffordable or impractical for our customers to obtain 
we manage all aspects of our service offerings for our customers  including installation  provisioning  monitoring  proactive fault management and billing 
we first launched our service in atlanta in april and now also operate in dallas  denver  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  detroit and the san francisco bay area  and  beginning in the first quarter of  miami 
we reported approximately million in revenue in  as compared to million in and million in we reported million and million of adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure see non gaap financial measures and net income of million and million  on a consolidated basis  in and  respectively 
as of december   we were providing communications services to  customer locations 
our ip voip network architecture 
we deliver our services other than our mobile voice and data services over a single all ip network using t connections 
this allows us to provide a wide array of voice and data services  attractive service features such as online additions and changes  quality of service and network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional telephone networks 
unlike traditional voice centric circuit switched communications networks  which require separate networks in order to provide voice and data services  we employ a single integrated network  which uses technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converges them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
we transmit our customers voice and data traffic over our secure private network and do not use the public internet  which is employed by other voip companies such as vonage and skype technologies 
our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services and we believe requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional service providers using legacy technologies 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus reducing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 
beginning in the first quarter of  leveraging the flexibility of our ip network and back office systems  we integrated mobile services with our wireline services 
we currently have an arrangement with an established national mobile carrier  which provides our nationwide  privately branded mobile service offering 
our target market and value proposition 
our target market is businesses with to employees in large metropolitan cities  using four to forty eight lines 
according to dun bradstreet data  there are approximately million businesses with to employees in the largest markets in the united states 
as of december   we served nine of these markets and generally expect to continue opening three new markets per year and intend to establish operations in the top markets in the us we provide each of our integrated packages of managed services at a competitively priced  fixed monthly fee 
certain enhanced services are available as optional add ons  and we charge per minute fees for long distance telephone and mobile phone usage in excess of included plan minutes 
we believe that we provide a differentiated value proposition to our customers  most of which do not have dedicated in house resources to fully address their communications requirements and who therefore value the ease of use and comprehensive management that we offer 
our primary competitors  the local telephone companies  do not generally offer packages of similar managed services to our target market 
we believe that this value proposition  along with our fixed length contracts  has been crucial to achieving our historical quarterly customer churn rate  which averaged approximately for the year ended december  
table of contents our strategy we intend both to grow our business in our current markets and to replicate our approach in additional markets 
to achieve our goal of profitably delivering sophisticated communications tools to small businesses in our current and future markets  we have adopted a strategy with the following principal components focus solely on the small business market in large metropolitan areas 
we target small businesses  most of which do not have dedicated in house resources to address their communications requirements fully and place a high value on customer support 
by focusing exclusively on small business customers  we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves from larger service providers and deliver superior service that small business customers value 
offer comprehensive packages of managed ip and mobile communications services 
we seek to be the single source provider of our customers wireline local and long distance voice  data and mobile communications needs 
all of our customers subscribe to one of our integrated beyondvoice packages of applications 
each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus additional value added applications 
all of our services other than our mobile voice and data services are delivered over high capacity t connections 
we do not offer our local and long distance voice services  mobile or broadband internet access applications on an unbundled basis 
we offer our services  including our mobile voice and data services  only under fixed length  flat rate contracts 
we believe that this approach results in high average revenue per customer location and a low customer churn rate 
beginning in the first quarter of  we added mobile voice and data services  including wireless email  calendar  contacts and web browsing to our service offerings 
we also now offer integrated mobile wireline applications such as unified messaging  one number service and simultaneous ring 
these mobile services are  and will only be  offered in conjunction with our core beyondvoice package  and we do not plan to offer mobile services on a stand alone basis 
rather  we offer our customers a bundled mobile and wireline offering with one bill and shared minutes across their business 
increase penetration of enhanced services to our customer base 
we seek to achieve higher revenue and margin per customer  increase customer productivity and satisfaction and reduce customer churn by providing enhanced services in addition to our local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access applications 
as of december   our average customer used a total of applications  whether as part of a package or purchased as an additional service  compared with applications as of december  focus sales and marketing resources on achieving significant market penetration 
we have chosen to focus our sales and marketing efforts on achieving deep market penetration and growing market share in a limited set of markets and gradually expanding the number of markets served  rather than taking an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets at an earlier stage in our company s history 
we believe that our targeted approach has resulted in our obtaining market share  and therefore profitability  at a faster rate and with better financial results than would have resulted from an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets at an earlier date 
in the future  we believe that our base of existing markets will enable us to expand into new markets at a faster pace than we have in the past 
in addition  because we prefer to develop and promote sales management from within  rather than hire from outside our company  our constantly growing base of successful markets provides a training ground for more management personnel that we can use to open new markets 
replicate our business model in new markets 
as of december   we operated in nine markets and generally expect to continue opening three new markets per year 
each time we expand into a new market  we adhere to the same process for choosing  preparing  launching and operating in those markets 
in launching our business in each new market  we use the same disciplined financial and operational reporting system to enable us to closely monitor our costs  market penetration and provisioning of customers and maintain consistent standards across all of our markets 

table of contents our strengths our business is focused on rapidly growing a loyal customer base  while maintaining capital and operating efficiency 
we believe we benefit from the following strengths our all ip network 
we are able to provide a wide range of enhanced communications services in a cost efficient manner over a single network  in contrast to traditional communications providers  which may require separate  incremental networks or substantial network upgrades in order to support similar services 
our all ip network architecture allows us to provide a comprehensive package of managed communications services including voip  with high network reliability and high quality of service 
capital efficiency 
we believe that our business approach requires lower capital and operating expenditures to bring our markets to positive cash flow compared to communications carriers using legacy technologies and operating processes 
in addition  our deployment of capital in each of our markets is largely success based  meaning  over time  a large portion of our capital outlay is incurred incrementally as our customer base grows 
our automated and integrated business processes 
we believe that the combination of our disciplined approach to sales  installation and service together with our automated business processes allow us to streamline our operations and maintain low operating costs 
our front and back office systems are highly automated and are integrated to synchronize multiple tasks  including installation  billing and customer care 
we believe this allows us to lower our customer service costs  efficiently monitor the performance of our network and provide automated and responsive customer support 
our highly regimented but personalized sales model 
we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting  training and deploying our direct sales representatives  which ensures a uniform sales culture and an effective means of acquiring new customers 
our direct sales representatives follow a disciplined daily schedule and meet face to face with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented  but personalized and consultative  selling process 
our experienced management team with focus on operating excellence 
our senior management team has substantial industry experience 
our top three executive officers have an average of over years of experience in the communications industry and have worked at a broad range of communications companies  both at startups and mature businesses  including local telephone companies  long distance carriers  competitive carriers  web hosting companies  internet and data providers and mobile communications providers 
our strong balance sheet and liquidity position 
as of december   we had a strong balance sheet with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenses  including those related to our current plans to continue opening three new markets per year 
in addition  we have an open  undrawn million revolving line of credit with bank of america  secured by substantially all of our assets 
we believe our strategies and strengths have contributed to our financial and operating performance  including high revenue growth  attractive average revenue per customer location and low customer churn 

table of contents our customers we are targeting entrepreneurial class businesses  or those with to employees  in certain of the largest metropolitan markets in the united states 
according to dun bradstreet data  there are approximately million businesses with to employees in the largest markets in the united states 
we are focusing on these markets because of their high concentration of small businesses 
we believe that focusing on these markets will allow us to maximize the resources we can apply by operating in the densest areas of small business in the united states 
as of december   we were providing communications services to  customer locations 
prior to joining cbeyond  the majority of our customers received communications services from the incumbent local telephone companies  and many of these businesses had more than one provider for the basic services of local and long distance voice services and internet access 
these businesses  in most cases  did not receive the focus and personalized attention that larger enterprises enjoy and often lagged behind larger businesses in the adoption of productivity enhancing and cost effective service offerings 
the small businesses we target typically lack affordable access to a t broadband connection and typically do not have dedicated in house resources to manage their communications needs 
a majority of our customer base uses to local voice lines  although the larger size customers in our range represent an increasing percentage of the total 
because we focus solely on small businesses  no single customer or group of customers represents a significant percentage of our customer base or revenues 
similarly  no single vertical customer segment represents a significant percentage of our base 
our largest customer sectors are professional services  which includes physicians  legal offices  banking institutions  consulting firms  accounting firms and real estate services 
each of these individually represents less than of our customer base 
our managed service offerings integrated service offerings we offer integrated managed communications services through our beyondvoice packages  which are provided over one to three dedicated t connections 
the beyondvoice packages are essentially a single basic product offered in three sizes  depending on the customer s size and need for bandwidth beyondvoice i beyondvoice ii beyondvoice iii customer profile businesses with to lines typically to employees businesses with to lines typically to employees businesses with to lines typically to employees with high bandwidth needs broadband connection one dedicated t connection two dedicated t connections three dedicated t connections number of voice lines landlines or landlines mobile line or landlines mobile lines included local minutes per month unlimited unlimited unlimited included domestic long distance minutes per month internet access speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage 
table of contents each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus a full line of managed services our customers can choose from to customize their package 
beginning in the first quarter of  we incorporated mobile services into our beyondvoice i package offering 
the local and long distance voice services in our beyondvoice packages include enhanced services  which are comparable to the services offered over traditional telephone networks  and business class features  which include call forwarding  call hunting  call transfer  call waiting  caller id and three way calling 
enhanced services in addition to the applications offered in our beyondvoice packages  we currently offer other services  which include voicemail  email  unified messaging  web hosting  virtual private network  beyondmobile  beyondoffice  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  and other applications and features 
in the future  we plan to offer other applications  such as network security  secure desktop  integrated mobile wireline applications  one number service and simultaneous ring 
our enhanced services are sold on an a la carte basis to subscribers of our beyondvoice bundled packages 
sales and marketing overview our sales force targets small businesses that have to employees 
we believe that the traditional local telephone companies have not concentrated their sales and marketing efforts on this business segment 
our direct sales representatives meet face to face with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented  but personalized and consultative  selling process 
we adhere to the same sales and operating procedures in every market we enter 
we track the performance of our sales team by maintaining detailed activity measurements in each of our markets 
we offer our customers a comprehensive communications solution that is simplified into three beyondvoice packages sold at fixed  predetermined prices 
we permit our sales people to sell only our offered packages and do not allow them to make discounted sales or alter the beyondvoice packages other than to add enhanced services or in connection with company wide promotions 
we believe that value is the primary motivating factor for our customers 
we believe that our commitment to offering integrated packages of services helps to simplify the entry of orders into our automated provisioning and installation process 
through our strategy of offering bundled services  we seek to become the single source provider of our customers wireline and mobile communications services 
we believe these factors contribute to our low customer churn rate 
sales channels direct sales 
the cornerstone of our sales efforts is our direct sales force 
at full staffing  we generally target to sales representatives per market 
our direct sales force accounted for approximately of our year to date sales through december  we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting and training our direct sales representatives which ensures a uniform sales approach and a consistent measure of revenue targets 
we typically recruit individuals without prior telecommunications sales experience so that we can exclusively provide all of their formal training 
the ongoing nature of our training is an essential part of our business strategy 
we require our sales personnel to maintain a regimented daily schedule of training  appointment setting and face to face meetings with customers 
a substantial part of the compensation for our sales force is based on commission 
we reinforce our clear expectations of success through a system of increasing quotas and advancement for those who succeed 
we promote from within  where possible  and develop our own sales management talent from promising sales representatives  who have the opportunity to advance as we grow 

table of contents indirect sales 
we supplement our direct sales force with our channel partners  who leverage their pre existing business relationships with the customer and act as sales agents for us 
the channel partners include value added resellers  local area network consultants and other it and telecommunications consultants to small businesses 
as compensation for their services  our channel partners receive ongoing residual payments on their sales 
our channel partners contributed approximately of our year to date sales through december  referrals program we believe we are building a culture of referrals that benefits both our direct and indirect selling efforts 
we obtain approximately one third of our new customers from our referral program through our current base of customers and through our referral partners 
our customers and referral partners are eligible to receive a one time referral credit for each new customer they refer 
marketing and advertising we focus our marketing resources on our direct and indirect sales efforts and programs that support those efforts 
we market ourselves as the last communications company a small business will ever need 
we have launched a focused marketing campaign of targeted print and online media 
our marketing local print media  industry specific print media and online advertising expenses for the year ended december  were million 
operations once a customer is signed  we believe we provide a highly differentiated customer experience in each aspect of the service relationship 
our highly automated and optimized business processes are designed to provide rapid and reliable installation  accurate billing and responsive  x care and support using both web enabled and human resources 
we continue to put emphasis on customer service as a key differentiator to drive customer satisfaction and customer referrals for new business 
our vp customer experience executive management position focuses on defining the overall customer experience across all customer touch points and the implementation of a cohesive program to ensure customer satisfaction and higher customer retention rates 
this customer experience focus has also contributed to continued improvements in our automated care and support capabilities used to service our customers and increase our operational efficiency 
installation we employ a team of service coordinators in each of our markets to handle the order entry and customer installation process 
a centralized circuit provisioning and customer activation group takes responsibility for ensuring that t circuits from the local telephone company to the customer s location are provisioned correctly and on time  together with local number portability and the appropriate features and applications ordered by the customer 
we seek to provision our beyondvoice i customers within calendar days  our beyondvoice ii within calendar days and our beyondvoice iii customers within calendar days 
our automated processes allow us to reduce the time and human intervention necessary to fill our circuit orders with the local telephone company 
currently  a majority of all circuit orders receive a firm order commitment from the local telephone company with no human intervention in less than hours from submission 
once an order is submitted  an outsourced technician is dispatched to the customer s location to install the integrated access device  to connect the customer s equipment to our network  and to activate and test the services 
after installation of the integrated access device  new services added by the customer will work with the customer s existing equipment and require no further equipment changes or capital expenditures 

table of contents billing we bill all of our customers electronically 
our customers receive their billing information via email 
full billing detail and analytical capabilities are available to our customers on the web through our cbeyond online website 
we do not send any paper bills 
in addition  over of our customers pay us online  either via credit card  electronic funds transfer  or automatic account debit 
because we employ flat rate billing in advance  customers are able to budget their costs  billing is simplified and errors are kept to a minimum 
because billing related calls are often the largest percentage of calls to customer care among communications service providers  our approach to billing greatly reduces the amount of resources needed in our customer care organization 
customer care and cbeyond online we offer our customers x support through live access to dedicated care representatives and through online resources 
although customers can choose to speak with one of our cbeyond representatives on a real time basis  cbeyond online has become our primary channel for customer care 
we offer a broad range of capabilities online  including functions allowing customers to review their requested services and accept their installation order for new customers  view  pay and analyze their bills  view and modify their services and account features  view and modify account information  research products and troubleshoot issues using the section of our web site devoted to frequently asked questions  which we call our find it fast knowledge base  and submit requests for account changes 
underpinning our care and support operations is a network that provides our customers with reliable and high quality service 
our network operations group manages and tracks network performance 
we have deployed state of the art network monitoring and diagnostic tools to provide our care representatives and network operations center personnel with real time insight into problem areas and the information needed to address them 
our all ip network architecture we deliver our services other than our mobile voice and data services over our single all ip network using t connections to connect customers to our network 
this allows us to provide a wide array of voice and data services  attractive service features such as real time online adds and changes  and network reliability and call quality comparable to that of traditional telephone networks 
unlike traditional voice centric circuit switched communications networks  we employ a single integrated network using technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converge them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
we transmit our customers voice traffic over our secure private network and do not rely on the best efforts public internet 
our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services and requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional service providers using legacy technologies 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus reducing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 
there are two distinct strategies that carriers adopt in deploying voip services voice as an application over the public internet 
because calls are carried over the public internet and not over a private network such as ours  service is often provided on a best efforts basis 
these service 
table of contents providers focus mainly on the consumer market 
we believe that these offerings may lack the call quality  network reliability  security and service features that business customers require 
our managed ip network 
we have deployed an all ip network over which voice calls primarily travel over a managed ip connection as opposed to the public internet 
this approach allows us to deliver quality of service similar to the quality of a public switched telephone network 
in our model  voice is an application over a private data network 
initially  all of our customers connected to our beyondvoice service via their existing analog premise equipment 
for those original customers  as well as any new customers using their existing analog premise equipment  we install and manage an integrated access device on the customer s premise that converts voip traffic to analog time division multiplexing  or tdm  and interconnects with the customer s phone system via digital or analog connections 
by interconnecting with the customer s existing tdm based phone system  we significantly minimize the investment required to switch to our voip service  simplify the installation of our service and greatly reduce the sales lead time 
while the majority of our new customers still connect to our service via their existing analog premise equipment  over the past several years  we have observed a steady increase in the deployment of ip based phone systems in the small business market 
according to several industry analysts  the sales of ip based phone systems have surpassed that of the traditional tdm phone systems 
many of these ip based phone systems  or ip pbxs  use a standards based and highly flexible protocol called session initiation protocol  or sip  and provide significant cost savings and increased functionality 
one of the key benefits for many small businesses is that they now have access to direct inward dial  or did  capability 
dids allow each employee to have their own direct phone number and not just an extension 
the availability of dids allows the end user to take advantage of many productivity enhancing applications such as unified messaging  auto attendant  integrated voicemail  selective call routing and much more 
in early  we began offering our beyondvoice with sipconnect service that allows customers to connect their ip pbx to our integrated access device directly via sip rather than traditional analog or digital 
direct sip peering between a customer s ip pbx and our voip network eliminates the need for the customer to purchase a tdm gateway  significantly reducing their hardware investment 
sip peering also eliminates the voip to tdm conversions which reduces the voice traffic latency  thereby increasing the voice quality 
end to end sip signaling and a pure ip bearer path lay the foundation for richer communication services than offered by the public switched telephone network today  which are essential to the future of packet based communications and the delivery of productivity enhancing applications 
the main advantage of our ip network architecture is its low cost structure relative to traditional circuit switched networks 
our more efficient single network approach enables us  relative to the historical experiences of legacy carriers  to buy fewer network components and at lower cost  lease fewer telecommunications circuits  employ fewer staff  rent less collocation space  incur lower maintenance costs  and integrate fewer support systems 
legacy competitive carriers often manage numerous overlapping and interconnected network technologies to provide the package of services that we provide on our single all ip network 
legacy network architectures can include a circuit switched local or long distance voice network  digital subscriber line  ip and frame relay data transmission networks  and asynchronous transfer mode and synchronous optical network intracity transport 
table of contents networks 
these different legacy networks generally require the expense and complexity of dedicated circuits and network transmission and monitoring equipment 
we believe that we benefit from the efficiency of being able to provide all our services over a single network 
one of the benefits of our ip network is the ability to integrate voice and data packets seamlessly 
bandwidth for voice is dynamically allocated  which allows the customer to enjoy full access to the mbps of bandwidth a t connection affords when no voice traffic is present on the access circuit 
when a customer activates a voice line  the allocated bandwidth automatically adjusts to allow the caller the amount of the t connection needed to process the call 
this feature allows us to provide increased speed and performance to our customers in their internet usage while assuring high quality voice service 
because legacy time division multiplexing service providers must dedicate fixed portions of their customer circuits to voice and data  they are unable to employ dynamic bandwidth allocation 
we organize our network into three groupings of equipment and circuits for purposes of network management and quality measurement the core network  which is located in our data centers and primarily comprises softswitches  backbone routers and media and feature servers  the distribution network  which includes collocation equipment such as t aggregation routers and trunking gateways  as well as ds transport circuits  and the access network  which comprises the t local loops and integrated access devices that connect customers equipment to our extended network 
our software monitors network quality and tracks potential problems by monitoring each of these network groupings 
the largest single monthly expense associated with our network is the cost of leasing t circuits to connect to our customers 
we lease t s primarily from the local telephone companies on a wholesale basis using unbundled network element  or une  loops or enhanced extended links 
an une enhanced extended link consists of a t loop connected to the interoffice transport unbundled network element 
this design allows us to obtain the functionality of a t loop without the need for collocation in the local telephone company s serving office 
we are able to take advantage of t une loop and une enhanced extended links and the associated cost based pricing of each because we meet certain qualifying criteria established by the federal communications commission  or the fcc  for use of these services and because we have built the processes and systems to take advantage of these wholesale circuits  in contrast to many competitive carriers  which lease t circuits under special access  or retail  pricing 
as a result of regulatory changes adopted via the fcc s triennial review remand order  or trro  we are required to lease t circuits under special access pricing when serving customers in certain geographical areas within the cities we serve 
see government regulation 
we employ these wholesale t circuits as follows une loops 
a une loop is the facility that extends from the customer s premises to our equipment collocated in the local exchange company end office that serves that customer location 
we employ une loops when we have a collocation in the central office that serves a customer 
we use high capacity t unbundled loops to serve our customers 
enhanced extended links 
an enhanced extended link is a combination of an unbundled t loop and an associated t transport element that are joined together by the local telephone company at the end office serving the customer location 
this allows us to obtain access to customer premises without having a collocation at the serving central office 
the current fcc rules require local telephone companies to provide t enhanced extended links to carriers subject to certain local use criteria  which we meet 
once we achieve sufficient density from a remote office  we deploy a dedicated ds transport and regroom the t transport elements onto the ds and remove the t transport elements 

table of contents historically  approximately half of our circuits were provisioned using une loops and half using enhanced extended links 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using une loops rather than enhanced extended links  but une loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office collocation equipment 
both une loops and enhanced extended links are substantially less expensive for us than special access circuits 
we lease ds circuits from local telephone companies or competitive carriers to carry traffic from the end office collocation to our equipment in a tandem wire center collocation 
we install central office collocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch a market with several collocations and add collocations as the business grows 
for example  in atlanta  our most mature market  we had collocations at the time of our initial public offering in november and collocations as of december  our voip technology allows us to concentrate approximately five times as many t circuits onto our ds transport circuits as legacy time division multiplexing providers 
specifically  we can dynamically allocate available transport bandwidth and can converge and mix voice and data traffic on the network  which offers us significant cost savings 
our software based voip architecture also provides the flexibility to add services and change features quickly  in contrast to legacy providers whose systems have historically required them to make time consuming physical moves  adds and changes 
we believe that our all ip  private network is optimized to deliver services in an efficient  flexible and cost effective manner 
relationship with cisco systems cisco systems  inc  or cisco systems  supplies the majority of our voip network technology 
when we began our business in  we evaluated a number of softswitch technologies and voip platforms 
as a result  we determined that cisco systems softswitch represented the most advanced softswitch for our needs  incorporating business class features that business users require with a higher degree of reliability and sophistication than other competing technologies 
in addition  we chose a single vendor solution in an effort to mitigate the risk of integrating equipment from multiple vendors in a relatively new technology 
we believe that the risk of integrating competing products has greatly diminished  and we will deploy those products with the best combination of price and performance going forward  whether from cisco systems or competing manufacturers 
competition as a managed services provider in the communications industry  we broadly compete with companies that could provide both voice and enhanced services to small businesses in our markets 
as a provider of voice services  our primary competitors are the incumbent local phone companies qwest in denver and at t in atlanta  dallas  detroit  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  and the san francisco bay area 
based on information provided by our customers at the time of activation  approximately of our customers used an incumbent local telephone company for local telephone service prior to signing with us  and the remainder used competitive local telephone companies 
many of our customers  prior to joining with us  used multiple vendors for local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access and have enjoyed the convenience of a sole sourced service since signing with us 
in addition to the local telephone companies  we compete with other competitive carriers in each of our markets 
these competitive carriers include covad communications group  inc  xo communications  llc  nuvox communications  paetec  integra telecom  inc  and itc deltacom  inc  among many others 
certain of these competitive carriers have adopted voip technology similar to that employed by us  and in the future we expect others to do so 
in addition  there are other providers using voip technology  such as vonage holdings corp  skype technologies sa  a subsidiary of ebay  inc  deltathree  inc 
and x  inc  which offer service using the public internet to access their customers 
we do not currently view these companies as our direct competitors because 
table of contents they primarily serve the consumer market and businesses with fewer than four lines 
certain cable television companies  such as cox communications  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  timewarner cable  inc and cablevision systems corp  have deployed voip primarily to address consumers and to compete better against local telephone companies for residential customers  although each of these companies also offers packaged services to small business customers 
we expect that  in the future  other companies may be formed to take advantage of our voip based business model 
existing companies may also expand their focus in the future to target small business customers 
in addition  certain utility companies have begun experimenting with delivering voice and high speed data services over power lines 
in connection with our beyondmobile offering  we compete with national wireless phone companies  such as at t  sprint nextel corporation  t mobile usa  inc and verizon wireless  as well as regional wireless providers 
government regulation our communications services business is subject to the statutory framework established by congress  state legislatures and varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
in contrast to certain other ip based carriers  we have elected to operate as a common carrier and thus our business does not rely on the regulatory classification of  or regulatory treatment for  ip based carriers in particular 
as a common carrier  we are subject to the jurisdiction of both federal and state regulatory agencies  which have the authority to review our prices  terms and conditions of service 
the regulatory agencies exercise minimal control over our prices and services  but do impose various obligations such as reporting  payment of fees and compliance with consumer protection and public safety requirements 
in addition  it is possible that  in limited circumstances  we will be subject to requirements placed on interconnected voip providers in addition to the requirements we are subject to as a common carrier 
we operate as a facilities based carrier and have received all necessary state and fcc authorizations to do so 
unlike resale carriers  we do not rely upon access to incumbent local exchange carrier switching facilities or capabilities 
as a facilities based carrier  we have undertaken a variety of regulatory obligations  including for example providing access to emergency systems  permitting law enforcement officials access to our network upon proper authorization  contributing to the cost of the fcc s and  where applicable  the state universal service programs and making our services accessible to persons with disabilities 
by operating as a common carrier  we also benefit from certain legal rights established by federal legislation  especially the federal telecommunications act of  or the telecom act  which gives us and other common carrier competitive entrants the right to interconnect to the networks of incumbent telephone companies and access to elements of their networks on an unbundled basis 
these rights are not available to providers who do not operate as common carriers 
we have used these rights to gain interconnection with the incumbent telephone companies and to purchase selected unbundled network elements  or unes  at prices based on incremental cost  especially t loop unes that provide us access to our customers premises 
congress  the fcc and state regulators are considering a variety of issues that may result in changes in the statutory and regulatory environment in which we operate our business 
several bills have been introduced regarding telecommunications issues such as the fcc s power to forbear from enforcing its regulations  but none would have any impact on our right to purchase unes 
while negative federal legislation is always a possibility  we believe it unlikely that any such negative legislation will be passed by congress in the fcc s current rules  as established in the august triennial review order and subsequent orders discussed below  establish the general framework of regulation that allows us to purchase the unes that we buy 
in addition  some of the changes under consideration by congress  the fcc and state regulators may affect our competitors differently than they affect us 
for example  the fcc s elimination of the une p rules several years ago affected resale carriers that seek to compete against us  but elimination of those rules did not affect us  because we never relied on une p as a part of our business model 
changes in the universal service fund may affect the fees we 
table of contents are required to pay to contribute to funding this program  but since we and our competitors generally pass these fees through to customers  we expect any changes to have minimal competitive effect 
similarly  we do not expect changes in inter carrier compensation rules to have a material effect on us because we derive the vast majority of our revenues directly from our customers  rather than from other carriers 
reciprocal compensation for termination of local calls is not a significant source of revenue  and we derive relatively little revenue from access charges for origination and termination of long distance calls over our network 
the colorado commission is examining certain une rates which may include a review of t and ds unes 
if these unes are included in the docket  it is possible that we would be subject to future rate increases 
although the nature and effects of governmental regulation are not predictable with certainty  we believe that the fcc is unlikely to adopt rules that extinguish our basic right or ability to compete in the telecommunications markets and that any rule changes that affect us will likely be accompanied by transition periods sufficient to allow us to adjust our business practices accordingly 
the following sections describe in more detail the regulatory developments described above and other regulatory matters that may affect our business 
regulatory framework our business relies heavily on the use of t une loops and une enhanced extended links  or eels  that include t loop components  for access to customer premises 
our existing strategy is based on fcc rules that require incumbent local exchange carriers to provide us these unes at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
as a result of a court decision  the fcc issued rules  which became effective on march   limiting the obligation of incumbent local exchange carriers to provide unes in certain circumstances 
the new rules require  among other things  that incumbent local exchange carriers continue providing t une loops in most situations  but not in high density central offices 
this exception affects the price we pay to obtain access to t loops in some of the central business districts we serve  as discussed in more detail below 
on june   the dc court of appeals upheld the fcc s new rules in their entirety 
these rules may nevertheless change at any time due to future fcc decisions  and we are unable to predict how such future developments may affect our business 
the telecom act the telecom act  which substantially revised the communications act of  established the regulatory preconditions to allow companies like us to compete for the provision of local communications services 
before the passage of the telecom act  states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local service area to a single dominant carrier  often a former subsidiary of at t  known as a regional bell operating company  which owned the entire local exchange network and operated a virtual monopoly in the provision of most local exchange services 
the regional bell operating companies  following some recent consolidation including at t finalizing its purchase of bellsouth at the end of  now consist of verizon  qwest communications and at t communications 
among other things  the telecom act preempts state and local governments from prohibiting any entity from providing communications service on a common carrier basis  which has the effect of eliminating prohibitions on entry that existed in almost half of the states at the time the telecom act was enacted 
at the same time  the telecom act preserved state and local jurisdiction over many aspects of local telephone service and  as a result  we are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
the telecom act provided the opportunity to accelerate the development of competition at the local level by  among other things  requiring the incumbent carriers to cooperate with competitors entry into the local exchange market 
to that end  incumbent local exchange carriers are required to allow interconnection of their networks with competitive networks 
incumbent local exchange carriers are further required by the telecom act to provide access to certain elements of their network to competitive local exchange carriers 

table of contents we have developed our business  including being designated as a common carrier  and designed and constructed our networks to take advantage of the features of the telecom act that require cooperation from the incumbent carriers 
we believe that the continued viability of the provisions relating to these matters is critical to the success of the competitive regime contemplated by the telecom act 
there have been numerous attempts to revise or eliminate the basic framework for competition in the local exchange services market through a combination of federal legislation  new fcc rules  and challenges to existing and proposed regulations by the incumbent carriers 
we anticipate that congress will consider a range of proposals to modify the telecom act over the next few years  including some proposals that could restrict or eliminate our access to elements of the incumbent local exchange carriers networks 
we consider it unlikely  however  that congress would reverse the fundamental policy of encouraging competition in communications markets 
congress may also consider legislation that would address the impact of the internet on the telecom act 
such legislation could seek to clarify the regulations applicable to voip and internet providers 
we believe that such legislation is unlikely to result in the imposition of new regulatory obligations on us  although it is possible that it will eliminate certain regulatory obligations that apply to us as a result of our status as a common carrier 
federal regulation the fcc regulates interstate and international communications services  including access to local communications networks for the origination and termination of these services 
we provide interstate and international services on a common carrier basis 
the fcc requires all common carriers to obtain an authorization to construct and operate communications facilities and to provide or resell communications services  between the united states and international points 
we have secured authority from the fcc for the installation  acquisition and operation of our wireline network facilities to provide facilities based domestic and international services 
the fcc imposes extensive economic regulations on incumbent local exchange carriers due to their ability to exercise market power 
the fcc imposes less regulation on common carriers without market power including  to date  competitive local exchange carriers 
unlike incumbent carriers  our retail services are not currently subject to price cap or rate of return regulation 
we are therefore free to set our own prices for end user services subject only to the general federal guidelines that our charges for interstate and international services be just  reasonable and non discriminatory 
we have filed tariffs with the fcc containing interstate rates we charge to long distance carriers for access to our network  also called interstate access charges 
the rates we can charge for interstate access  unlike our end user services  are limited by fcc rules 
we are also required to file periodic reports  to pay regulatory fees based on our interstate revenues and to comply with fcc regulations concerning the content and format of our bills  the process for changing a customer s subscribed carrier and other consumer protection matters 
the fcc has the authority to impose monetary forfeitures and to condition or revoke a carrier s operating authority for violations of these requirements 
our operating costs are increased by the need to assure compliance with these regulatory obligations 
the telecom act is intended to increase competition 
specifically  the telecom act opens the local services market by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to permit interconnection to their networks and establishing incumbent local exchange carrier obligations with respect to interconnection with the networks of other carriers  provision of services for resale  unbundled access to elements of the local network  arrangements for local traffic exchange between both incumbent and competitive carriers  number portability  access to phone numbers  access to rights of way  dialing parity and collocation of communications equipment in incumbent central offices 
incumbent local exchange carriers are required to negotiate in good faith with carriers requesting any or all of these arrangements 
if the negotiating carriers cannot reach agreement within a prescribed time  either carrier may request binding arbitration of the disputed issues by the state regulatory commission 
where an agreement has not been reached  incumbent local exchange carriers remain subject to interconnection obligations established by the fcc and state communications regulatory commissions 

table of contents the telecom act also permitted a regional bell operating company to enter the long distance market within its local telephone service area upon showing that certain statutory conditions set forth in section of the telecom act have been met and upon obtaining fcc approval 
the fcc has approved regional bell operating company petitions for in region long distance for every state in the nation  and each regional bell operating company is now permitted to offer long distance service to its local telephone customers 
the fcc subsequently relieved the regional bell operating companies  or rboc  of some of the conditions imposed for section long distance approval  including in particular conditions that impose obligations to provide access to broadband although not t unes beyond what the fcc has required in its triennial review order  or tro  and triennial review remand order  or trro  which are discussed below in more detail 
as a result of the state commission reviews to implement the fcc s tro trro decisions  some states eg  georgia and illinois adopted rules to implement the requirement that rbocs provide competitors with access to network elements pursuant to section or in the case of illinois pursuant to state law 
some states  like georgia and illinois  have also adopted rules setting the rates that an rboc must charge for such network elements 
the fcc is currently considering whether to preempt such state regulation of unes offered exclusively under section  but the rules are not faring well in various federal court appeals federal district courts in atlanta and chicago recently declared that the georgia and illinois public service commissions lacked the authority to set rates for or similar state based network elements 
triennial review order and appeals 
as discussed above  we rely on provisions of the telecom act that require the incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competitors access to elements of their local network on an unbundled basis  known as unes 
the telecom act requires that the fcc consider whether competing carriers would be impaired in their ability to offer telecommunications services without access to particular unes 
in the tro of august  the fcc substantially revised its rules interpreting and enforcing the une requirements  while maintaining the general regulatory framework under which we purchase our unes 
the fcc also adopted new eligibility requirements for the use of une eels 
under these rules  a carrier seeking to purchase an eel must certify that each circuit so purchased meets specific criteria designed to ensure that the circuit will be used to provide local exchange voice service 
we believe  and are prepared to so certify  that all of our eel circuits satisfy these criteria 
these aspects of the order were not affected by the subsequent court decision reviewing the tro or by the trro 
in the tro  the fcc also eliminated unbundling for certain incumbent local exchange carrier fiber that utilize packet technology and severely restricted unbundling for fiber loops to homes and  in a subsequent order  other predominantly residential locations such as apartment buildings 
we currently do not use any fiber to home unes 
we were  therefore  not materially affected by this ruling  although the elimination of une loops serving predominantly residential buildings could restrict our access to some small business customers 
in march  a court decision required the fcc to reconsider portions of its tro  and as a result the fcc further revised the rules in the trro adopted in late  effective march  the trro for the most part required that incumbent local exchange carriers continue to make access available to competitors for the high capacity loop and transport unes we use 
however  the new rules placed new conditions and limitations on the incumbent local exchange carriers obligation to unbundle these elements 
incumbent local exchange carriers are required to continue providing t une loops at cost based rates  except in central offices serving  or more business lines and in which four or more fiber based competitors have colocated 
because many of our customers are located in high density central business districts  some of our existing t loops are affected by this new limitation 
an incumbent local exchange carrier is also not required to provide more than t une loops to any single building  even in an area in which t loops are unbundled 
incumbent local exchange carriers are also required to continue providing both t and ds transport circuits  except on routes connecting certain high density central offices 
an incumbent local exchange carrier is 
table of contents not required to offer une t transport including transport as a component of a t eel between central offices that both serve at least  business lines or have four or more fiber based collocators 
for ds transport  the exemption from bundling applies if both central offices serve at least  business access lines or have three or more collocators 
again  because of the nature of the markets we serve  many of the t eels and ds transport circuits we use are affected by this exemption 
the fcc also imposed a cap of on ds transport unes and a cap of t transport unes that must be made available by an incumbent local exchange carrier on any given route  even where the high density exception does not apply 
due to certain inconsistencies between the rules and the text of the trro with regard to the application of the t transport cap  the states have applied that cap inconsistently 
various parties  including us  have petitioned the fcc to reconsider its decision on the transport cap  and these petitions are currently pending with the fcc 
on june   the dc circuit court of appeals upheld the fcc s trro in its entirety 
we expect that access to t loops serving current and new customer locations will continue to be available to us regardless of future changes in the fcc rules  although not necessarily at current prices 
all incumbent local exchange carriers are required  independent of the une rules  to offer us some form of t loop and transport services 
it is possible that the fcc may establish rates for some of these services at levels that are comparable to current une rates  or that we may be able to negotiate reasonable prices for these services through commercial negotiations with incumbent local exchange carriers 
however  we cannot be assured that either of these possibilities will occur 
if all other options were unavailable  we would be required to pay special access rates for these services 
these rates are substantially higher than the rates we pay for unes 
sbc at t and verizon mci merger proceedings 
in late  the fcc and doj approved the mergers of sbc with at t and verizon with mci 
the fcc  however  placed certain conditions on its approval of the mergers 
significantly  the fcc froze une pricing for two years and special access pricing for thirty months at current rates 
the fcc  however  further ruled that une rates under appeal at the time of the conditions are exempt from this provision if higher rates are ultimately required 
the texas rates are still under appeal 
if higher rates are ultimately ordered  the rate freeze would not apply 
at t bellsouth merger proceeding 
in early  at t formerly sbc at t and bellsouth announced their agreement to merge  and the merger was closed on december  the doj allowed the merger to proceed without conditions  but the fcc  in granting its approval of the merger  imposed significant conditions including an agreement by at t not to use fcc forbearance procedures for a period of months  not to seek any une rate increases for the same period and to allow competitive carriers to use interconnection agreements effective in any at t state in any other at t state 
telric proceeding 
in late  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address the methodology used to price unes and to determine whether the current methodology total element long run incremental cost  or telric should be modified 
specifically  the fcc is evaluating whether adjustments should be made to permit incumbent local exchange carriers to recover their actual embedded costs and whether to change the time horizon used to project the forward looking costs 
this proceeding is still pending  and we cannot be certain as to either the timing or the result of the agency s action 
special access proceeding 
in january  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking to initiate a comprehensive review of rules governing the pricing of special access service offered by incumbent local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation including bellsouth  at t  qwest  verizon and some other incumbent local exchange carriers 
to the extent we are no longer able to obtain certain t loops and ds transport circuits as unes  we may choose to obtain equivalent circuits as special access  in which case our costs will be determined by the incumbent local exchange carriers special access pricing 
special access pricing by the major incumbent local exchange carriers currently is subject to price cap rules as well as pricing flexibility rules which permit these carriers to offer volume and term discounts and contract tariffs phase i pricing flexibility and remove special access service in a defined geographic area from price caps regulation phase ii pricing flexibility based on showings of competition 
the notice of proposed rulemaking tentatively concludes that the 
table of contents fcc should continue to permit pricing flexibility where competitive market forces are sufficient to constrain special access prices  but the fcc will undertake an examination of whether the current triggers for pricing flexibility based on certain levels of collocation by competitors within the defined geographic area accurately assess competition and have worked as intended 
the notice of proposed rulemaking also asks for comment on whether certain aspects of incumbent local exchange carrier special access tariff offerings eg basing discounts on previous volumes of service  tying nonrecurring charges and termination penalties to term commitments  and imposing use restrictions in connection with discounts  are unreasonable 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that this proceeding will have on our cost structure 
intercarrier compensation 
in  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address rules that require one carrier to make payment to another carrier for the exchange of traffic intercarrier compensation 
in its notice of proposed rulemaking  the fcc sought comment on some possible advantages of moving from the current rules to a bill and keep structure for all traffic types in which carriers would recover costs from their own customers  not from other carriers 
in february  the fcc requested further comments on these issues and on several specific proposed plans for restructuring intercarrier compensation 
more recently  at t  bellsouth  numerous rural carriers and others offered a new proposal for reforming intercarrier compensation 
we currently have little to no revenue exposure to the exchange of local traffic since our traffic is balanced and in most cases subject to bill and keep arrangements with other local carriers 
we do  however  collect revenue for access charges for the origination and termination of other carriers long distance traffic 
if the fcc were to move to a mandatory bill and keep arrangement for this traffic or to a single cost based rate structure  at significantly lower rates than we currently charge  our revenues would be reduced 
we believe  however  that we have much less reliance on this type of revenue than many other competitive providers  because the vast majority of our revenue derives from our end user customers 
we also consider it likely that  if the fcc does adopt a bill and keep regime  it will provide some opportunity for carriers to adjust other rates to offset lost access revenues 
nevertheless  we cannot predict either the timing or the result of this fcc rulemaking 
regulatory treatment of voip 
in february  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address the appropriate regulatory framework for voip providers 
currently  the regulatory classification of most voip providers is not clear 
in the proceeding initiated in  the fcc is considering what regulation is appropriate for voip providers and whether the traffic carried by these providers will be subject to access charges 
the principal focus of this rulemaking is on whether voip providers should be subject to some or all of the regulatory obligations of common carriers 
we currently treat our services as subject to common carrier rules and regulations and  as a result  we do not anticipate that future rulings on the regulatory treatment of voip will have a material impact on us 
nevertheless  it is possible that the fcc s classification of voip services could affect our rights to obtain t loops and other unes 
as part of that proceeding  the fcc adopted new rules requiring all interconnected voip providers within days to enable all of their customers to reach designated emergency services by dialing interconnected voip providers were also required to deliver notices to their customers advising them of limitations in their emergency services and to make certain compliance filings with the fcc 
as a regulated common carrier  however  we provide traditional service over our dedicated network 
because the fcc s definition of the term interconnected voip provider is not entirely clear  the rules could be interpreted to apply to our services 
as such  we took steps to meet the notification and acknowledgement requirements to comply with fcc s order based on our interpretation of the order 
we cannot guarantee that the fcc will agree with our interpretation of its order  should it ever be addressed 
forbearance proceedings 
on march   a verizon petition for forbearance from title ii regulation and other requirements for broadband transmission facilities used to serve large business customers was granted by default as a matter of law due to inaction by the fcc 
thus verizon has now been relieved of common carrier obligations for these broadband transmission facilities 
while the instant relief granted does not have a direct impact on the une facilities used by us and appears not to apply to t or ds circuits  it will impact access 
table of contents rights to higher capacity transmission facilities in the future 
all appeals associated with the default grant have been denied  and the grant is now final 
following the default grant of the verizon petition  at t  qwest  and bellsouth requested the same relief as that extended to verizon 
at t and bellsouth were granted the requested relief 
the qwest petition remains pending 
the relief granted to at t and bellsouth does not have a direct impact on the une t  une ds or special access facilities we use but will impact access rights to higher capacity transmission facilities in the future 
the relief requested in the pending qwest petition should not have a direct impact on the une t  une ds or special access facilities we use but would impact access rights to higher capacity transmission facilities in the future 
on september   verizon filed six petitions with the fcc requesting forbearance from the fcc s unbundling rules 
specifically  verizon seeks the elimination of all loop and transport unbundling requirements and of dominant carrier regulation for switched access service in pittsburgh  new york  boston  providence  virginia beach and philadelphia 
as the basis for its request  verizon relies upon a decision made in by the fcc that relieved qwest of its unbundling obligations in the omaha msa and of its dominant carrier status and obligations based on the level of cable penetration in that market 
in that proceeding  the fcc eliminated qwest s obligation to offer loop and transport unes under of the telecommunications act of the act in nine wire centers in the omaha metropolitan statistical area  or msa  in which the local cable operator has a specified level of facilities build out 
in the same proceeding  the fcc also reaffirmed qwest s obligation to continue providing those unes under of the act 
the net impact of this fcc action did not eliminate the availability of unes in omaha  but it did make them more expensive 
on december   the fcc denied each of the six verizon petitions in their entirety 
on april   qwest filed similar forbearance petitions covering denver  minneapolis  phoenix and seattle 
the fcc must act on these petitions by mid despite the recent denials of lec forbearance petitions and subject to significant merger related limitations operating to constrain at t forbearance activity until mid  we think there remains a possibility that the regional bell operating companies and other incumbent local exchange carriers ilec s may file additional forbearance petitions in the future seeking elimination of unbundling requirements in other msas 
we are not aware of wire centers in any msa in which we currently offer or plan to offer service that would meet the apparent standard for une elimination applied in previous forbearance proceedings 
depending on the future levels of facilities based deployment in the markets at issue  however  such forbearance petitions could eventually raise the prices that we pay for t loops  eels  and other une facilities currently made available under of the act 
further  additional grants of forbearance in markets where we do not currently have facilities could cause us to adjust or modify plans for expansion into those markets 
customer proprietary network information cpni 
in early  the fcc required all carriers to certify compliance with fcc s cpni rules and requirements 
on february   the fcc initiated a proceeding seeking industry comment on what additional steps the fcc should take  if any  to further protect the privacy of cpni collected and held by telecommunications carriers 
we are unable to predict what new requirements  if any  may be placed on carriers 
we are also subject to federal and state rules and regulations pertaining to cpni 
in connection with these rules and regulations  the fcc has initiated a series of investigations regarding the cpni practices of individual companies  including ours 
the fcc s investigation of our cpni compliance began on february  on april   the fcc issued a notice of apparent liability which became part of ongoing discussions between us and the fcc regarding our potential noncompliance with several administrative record keeping rules 
on october   this matter came to a close when we entered into a consent decree with the fcc  whereby we made a payment of million to the united states treasury 
we had accurately estimated and recorded this liability in prior periods 

table of contents state regulation state agencies exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services  including local telephone service and in state toll calls 
to date  we are authorized to provide intrastate local telephone  long distance telephone and operator services in california  colorado  georgia  illinois  texas  michigan and florida  as well as in eight other states where we are not yet operational 
as a condition to providing intrastate telecommunications services  we are required  among other things  to file and maintain intrastate tariffs or price lists describing the rates  terms and conditions of our services  comply with state regulatory reporting  tax and fee obligations  including contributions to intrastate universal service funds  and comply with  and to submit to  state regulatory jurisdiction over consumer protection policies including regulations governing customer privacy  changing of service providers and content of customer bills  complaints  transfers of control and certain financing transactions 
generally  state regulatory authorities can condition  modify  cancel  terminate or revoke certificates of authority to operate in a state for failure to comply with state laws or the rules  regulations and policies of the state regulatory authority 
fines and other penalties may also be imposed for such violations 
as we expand our operations  the requirements specific to any individual state will be evaluated to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of that state 
in addition  the states have authority under the federal telecom act to determine whether we are eligible to receive funds from the federal universal service fund 
they also have authority to approve or in limited circumstances reject agreements for the interconnection of telecommunications carriers facilities with those of the incumbent local exchange carrier  to arbitrate disputes arising in negotiations for interconnection and to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements 
in exercising this authority  the states determine the rates  terms and conditions under which we can obtain access to the loop and transport unes that are required to be available under the fcc rules 
the states may re examine these rates  terms and conditions from time to time 
state commissions are in the process of implementing the tro and trro by conducting proceedings to interpret the tro trro requirements for purposes of amending the interconnection agreements as required by the trro 
many of these proceedings have concluded for the most part  however  various sub issues remain under review and decisions are still subject to petitions for reconsideration and appeals in many cases 
as such  the orders are not final and changes could occur that would impact the rulings of the state commissions 
as a part of the trro implementation proceedings  many states are also requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide access to the network elements required under section and in some cases are conducting investigations to provide pricing of network elements 
state rulings on our rights to access network elements and the pricing of elements will also be subject to appeals and possibly fcc intervention 
california  georgia  illinois and texas have addressed access rights in the context of the trro proceedings  but only georgia set rates for network elements  a decision that was subsequently overturned by a united states district court 
this decision will result in higher access rates for us for a small percentage of circuits that we purchase from bellsouth  but the court explicitly stated that bellsouth may not issue backbills for the period of time during which we were paying lower rates 
state governments and their regulatory authorities may also assert jurisdiction over the provision of intrastate ip communications services where they believe that their authority is broad enough to cover regulation of ip based services 
various state regulatory authorities have initiated proceedings to examine the regulatory status of ip telephony services 
we operate as a regulated carrier subject to state regulation  rules and fees and  therefore  do not expect to be affected by these proceedings 
the fcc proceeding on voip is expected to address  among other issues  the appropriate role of state governments in the regulation of these services 

table of contents local regulation in certain locations  we are required to obtain local franchises  licenses or other operating rights and street opening and construction permits to install  expand and operate our telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
in some of the areas where we provide services  we pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of gross revenues 
cities that do not currently impose fees might seek to impose them in the future  and after the expiration of existing franchises  fees could increase 
under the federal telecom act  state and local governments retain the right to manage the public rights of way and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers  on a competitively neutral and non discriminatory basis  to recover the costs associated with government s management of the public rights of way 
as noted above  these activities must be consistent with the federal telecom act and may not have the effect of prohibiting us from providing telecommunications services in any particular local jurisdiction 
in certain circumstances  we may be subject to local fees associated with construction and operation of telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
to the extent these fees are required  we comply with requirements to collect and remit the fees

table of contents item a 
risk factors risk related to our business the success of our expansion plans depends on a number of factors that are beyond our control 
we have grown our business by entering new geographical markets  and we plan to continue opening three new markets per year 
although we expanded into markets in  there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our past growth 
our success in expanding to new markets depends on the following factors the availability and retention of qualified and effective local management  the overall economic health of the new markets  the number and effectiveness of competitors  the pricing structure under which we will be able to obtain circuits and purchase other services required to serve our customers  our ability to establish a relationship and work effectively with the local telephone company for the provision of access lines to customers  and the maintenance of state regulation that protects us from unfair business practices by local telephone companies or others with greater market power who have relationships with us as both competitors and suppliers 
we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base at historic rates  which would result in a decrease in the rate of revenue growth 
we experienced an annual growth rate in customer locations of as of december  from december  we may not experience this same growth rate in the future  or we may not grow at all  in our current markets 
future growth in our existing markets may be more difficult than our growth has been to date due to increased or more effective competition in the future  difficulties in scaling our business systems and processes or difficulty in maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified market management personnel  sales personnel and qualified integrated access device installation service providers to obtain and support additional customers 
failure to continue to grow our customer base at historic rates would result in a corresponding decrease in the rate of our revenue growth 
the fixed pricing structure for our integrated packages makes us vulnerable to price increases by our suppliers for network equipment and access fees for circuits that we lease to gain access to our customers 
we offer our integrated packages to customers at a fixed price for one  two or three years 
if we experience an increase in our costs due to price increases from our suppliers  vendors or third party carriers or increases in access  installation  interconnection fees payable to local telephone companies or other fees  we may not be able to pass these increases on to our customers immediately  and this could materially harm our results of operations 
we face intense competition from other providers of communications services that have significantly greater resources than we do 
several of these competitors are better positioned to engage in competitive pricing  which may impede our ability to implement our business model of attracting customers away from such providers 
the market for communications services is highly competitive 
we compete  and expect to continue to compete  with many types of communications providers  including traditional local telephone companies 
in the future  we may also face increased competition from cable companies  new voip based service providers or other managed service providers with similar business models to our own 
we integrated mobile services with our existing services in the first quarter of and now face competition from mobile service providers as well 

table of contents our current or future competitors may provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us  or at lower prices  or adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
a substantial majority of our target customers are existing small businesses that are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers 
the success of our operations is dependent on our ability to persuade these small businesses to leave their current providers 
many of these providers have competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  better access to capital  brand name recognition and long standing relationships with customers 
these resources may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our current markets and limit our ability to expand into new markets 
because of their greater financial resources  some of our competitors can also better afford to reduce prices for their services and engage in aggressive promotional activities 
such tactics could have a negative impact on our business 
for example  some of our competitors have adopted pricing plans such that the rates that they charge are not always substantially higher  and in some cases are lower  than the rates that we charge for similar services 
in addition  other providers are offering unlimited or nearly unlimited use of some of their services for an attractive monthly rate 
any of the foregoing factors could require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive or cause us to lose customers  resulting in a decrease in our arpu and revenue 
continued industry consolidation could further strengthen our competitors  and we could lose customers or face adverse changes in regulation 
in  verizon announced its merger with mci  and sbc announced its merger with at t  with the combined company being renamed at t 
in late  at t and bellsouth completed the merger of their two companies 
while we believe that  at least in the short term  this increasing consolidation in the communications industry will result in a greater focus on the part of our competitors on the large enterprise and consumer markets  the increased size and market power of these companies may have adverse consequences for us 
these competitors could focus their large resources  in the future  on regaining share in the small business sector  and we could lose customers or not grow as rapidly 
furthermore  these companies could use their greater resources to lobby effectively for changes in federal or state regulation that could have an adverse effect on our cost structure or our right to use access circuits that they are currently required to make available to us 
these changes would have a harmful effect on our future financial results 
increasing use of voip technology by our competitors  entry into the market by new providers employing voip technology and improvements in quality of service of voip technology provided over the public internet could increase competition 
our success is based partly on our ability to provide voice and broadband services at a price that customers typically pay for voice services alone by taking advantage of cost savings achieved by employing voip technology  as compared to using traditional networks 
the adoption of voip technology by other communications carriers  including existing competitors such as local telephone companies that currently use legacy technologies  could increase price competition 
moreover  other voip providers could also enter the market 
because networks using voip technology can be deployed with less capital investment than traditional networks  there are lower barriers to entry in this market  and it may be easier for new entrants to emerge 
increased competition may require us to lower our prices or may make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers or add new customers 
we believe we generally do not compete with voip providers who use the public internet to transmit communications traffic  as these providers generally do not provide the level and quality of service typically demanded by the business customers we serve 
however  future advances in voip technology may enable these providers to offer an improved level and quality of service to business customers over the public internet and with lower costs than using a private network 
this development could result in increased price competition 

table of contents our operational support systems and business processes may not be adequate to effectively manage our growth 
our continued success depends on the scalability of our systems and processes 
as of december   none of our individual market operations have supported levels of customers substantially in excess of  and our centralized systems and processes have not supported more than approximately  customer locations 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes are adequate to support ongoing growth in customers 
in addition  our growing managed services profile  including our new mobile services and associated new applications  may create operating inefficiencies and result in service problems if we are unsuccessful in fully integrating such new services into our existing operations 
failure to manage our future growth effectively could harm our quality of service and customer relationships  which could increase our customer churn  result in higher operating costs  write offs or other accounting charges and otherwise materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on local telephone companies for the installation and maintenance of our customers t access lines and other network elements and facilities 
our customers t access lines are installed and maintained by local telephone companies in each of our markets 
if the local telephone company does not perform the installation properly or in a timely manner  our customers could experience disruption in service and delays in obtaining our services 
since inception  we have experienced routine delays in the installation of t lines by the local telephone companies to our customers in each of our markets  although these delays have not yet resulted in any material impact to our ability to compete and add customers in our markets 
any work stoppage action by employees of a local telephone company that provides us services in one of our markets could result in substantial delays in activating new customers lines and could materially harm our operations 
although local telephone companies may be required to pay fines and penalties to us for failures to provide us with these installation and maintenance services according to prescribed time intervals  the negative impact on our business of such failures could substantially exceed the amount of any such cash payments 
furthermore  we are also dependent on traditional local telephone companies for access to their collocation facilities  and we utilize certain of their network elements 
failure of these elements or damage to a local telephone company s collocation facility would cause disruptions in our service 
we depend on third party providers who install our integrated access devices at customer locations 
we must maintain relationships with efficient installation service providers in our current cities and identify similar providers as we enter new markets in order to maintain quality in our operations 
the installation of integrated access devices at customer locations is an essential step that enables our customers to obtain our service 
we outsource the installation of integrated access devices to a number of different installation vendors in each market 
we must ensure that these vendors adhere to the timelines and quality that we require to provide our customers with a positive installation experience 
in addition  we must obtain these installation services at reasonable prices 
if we are unable to continue maintaining a sufficient number of installation vendors in our markets who provide high quality service at reasonable prices to us  we may have to use our own employees to perform installations of integrated access devices 
we may not be able to manage such installations effectively using our own employees with the quality we desire and at reasonable costs 
some of our services are dependent on facilities and systems maintained by or equipment manufactured by third parties over which we have no control  the failure of which could cause interruptions or discontinuation of some of our services  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our growth 
we provide some of our existing services  such as email and web hosting  by reselling to our customers services provided by third parties  and beginning in the first quarter of  we started offering mobile options integrated with our existing services by reselling mobile services provided by an established national third party mobile carrier and reselling mobile equipment manufactured by third parties 
we do not have control over the 
table of contents networks and other systems maintained by these third parties or their equipment manufacturing processes  facilities or supply chains 
if our third party providers fail to maintain their facilities properly or fail to respond quickly to network or other problems  our customers may experience interruptions in the service they obtain from us or we may not be able to supply the needed mobile equipment 
any service interruptions experienced by our customers could negatively impact our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our ability to attract new customers 
we are regulated by the federal communications commission  state public service commissions and local regulating governmental bodies 
changes in regulation could result in price increases on the circuits that we lease from the local telephone companies or losing our right to lease these circuits from them 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulation by telecommunications authorities at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in regulatory policy could increase the fees we must pay to third parties  make certain required inputs for our network less readily available to us or subject us to more stringent requirements that could cause us to incur additional operating expenditures 
the t connections we provide to our customers are leased primarily from our competitors  the local telephone companies 
the rules of the fcc  adopted under the telecommunications act of  generally entitle us to lease these connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
it is possible  though we believe unlikely  that congress will pass legislation in the future that will diminish or eliminate our right to lease such connections at regulated rates 
in addition  a court decision in late led the fcc to eliminate our right to purchase connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs in some situations 
therefore  the costs we incur to obtain some of these t connections increased 
our rights of access to the facilities of local telephone companies may also change as a result of future regulatory decisions  including forbearance petitions as well as court decisions 
although at t is prevented by merger conditions placed on it by the fcc from filing forbearance petitions related to une availability until at least mid  qwest is under no such restriction and in fact filed a forbearance petition with the fcc on april  seeking to escape unbundling requirements in denver  colorado  where we do business 
in december  the fcc denied a similar request from verizon regarding new york  philadelphia  virginia beach  pittsburg  providence and boston 
should the denver petition be granted in whole or in part  our access to une availability in denver would be diminished  which may lower our margins in denver 
although we expect that we will continue to be able to obtain t connections for our customers  we may not be able to do so at current prices 
the pricing for the majority of the t connections we use is established by state regulatory commissions and  from time to time  this pricing is reviewed and the state commission decisions are subject to appeal 
if our right to obtain these connections at regulated prices based on incremental costs is further impaired  we will need either to negotiate new commercial arrangements with the local telephone companies to obtain the connections  perhaps at unfavorable rates and conditions  or to obtain other means of providing connections to our customers  which may be expensive and require a long timeframe to implement  either of which may cause us to exit such affected markets and decrease our customer base and revenues 
the fcc is also considering changing its rules for calculating incremental cost based rates  which could result in either increases or decreases in our cost to lease these facilities 
significant increases in wholesale prices  especially for the loop element we use most extensively  could materially harm our business the fcc is reexamining its policies towards voip and telecommunications in general 
new or existing regulation could subject us to additional fees or increase the competition we face 
we currently operate as a regulated common carrier  which subjects us to some regulatory obligations 
the fcc adopted rules applicable to interconnected voip providers  but it has not determined whether to classify interconnected voip providers as common carriers 
the rules applicable to interconnected voip providers 
table of contents require them to provide access to emergency services for all customers that are comparable to the services provided by traditional telephone networks  to implement certain capabilities for the monitoring of communications by law enforcement agencies pursuant to a subpoena or court order and to contribute to the federal universal service fund 
as a common carrier  we currently comply with the requirements  comply with the law enforcement assistance requirements applicable to traditional telecommunications carriers and contribute to the federal universal service fund 
the fcc continues to examine its policies towards services provided over ip networks  such as our voip technology  and the results of these proceedings could impose additional obligations  fees or limitations on us 
we are also subject to federal and state rules and regulations pertaining to cpni 
in connection with these rules and regulations  the fcc initiated a series of investigations regarding the cpni practices of individual companies  including ours 
the fcc s investigation of our cpni compliance has been resolved  however  it is possible there may be additional investigations in the future that may result in fines or assessments 
regulatory decisions may also affect the level of competition we face 
reduced regulation of retail services offered by local telephone companies could increase the competitive advantages those companies enjoy  cause us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive or otherwise make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers 
our customer churn rate may increase 
customer churn occurs when a customer discontinues their service with us  whether due to going out of business or switching to a competitor 
changes in the economy  as well as increased competition from other providers  can both impact our customer churn rate 
we cannot predict general economic conditions 
nor can we predict future pricing by our competitors  but we anticipate that aggressive price competition will continue 
lower prices offered by our competitors could contribute to an increase in customer churn 
although our customer churn rate was approximately per month for the years ended december  and and also for the first half of  our churn has recently increased to in the third quarter of and to in the fourth quarter of we believe this elevated churn is due to general economic factors 
we also believe churn will continue to be elevated through at least the first quarter of while we believe churn may be reduced in future periods  there is no assurance that this will occur  as we cannot predict the effects or duration of the current economic downturn 
higher customer churn rates could adversely impact our revenue growth 
a sustained and significant growth in the churn rate could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from cisco systems  inc our success depends upon the quality  availability and price of cisco s network equipment and software 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from cisco systems 
in addition  we rely on cisco systems for technical support and assistance 
although we believe that we maintain a good relationship with cisco systems and our other suppliers  if cisco systems or any of our other suppliers were to terminate our relationship or were to cease making the equipment and software we use  our ability to maintain  upgrade or expand our network could be impaired 
although we believe that we would be able to address our future equipment needs with equipment obtained from other suppliers  we cannot assure you that such equipment would be compatible with our network without significant modifications or cost  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain the equipment necessary to maintain our network  our ability to attract and retain customers and provide our services would be impaired 
in addition  our success depends on our obtaining network equipment and software at affordable prices 
significant increases in the price of these products would harm our financial results and may increase our capital requirements 

table of contents we depend on third party vendors for information systems 
if these vendors discontinue support for the systems we use or fail to maintain quality in future software releases  we could sustain a negative impact on the quality of our services to customers  the development of new services and features and the quality of information needed to manage our business 
we have entered into agreements with vendors that provide for the development and operation of back office systems  such as ordering  provisioning and billing systems 
we also rely on vendors to provide the systems for monitoring the performance and condition of our network 
the failure of those vendors to perform their services in a timely and effective manner at acceptable costs could materially harm our growth and our ability to monitor costs  bill customers  provision customer orders  maintain the network and achieve operating efficiencies 
such a failure could also negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
we use software technology developed internally and by third party vendors  and hardware technology developed by third party vendors 
we or any of these vendors could be subject of a lawsuit alleging a violation of the intellectual property of third parties 
we have created software systems  purchased software from third party vendors and purchased hardware from third party vendors 
our contracts with these vendors provide indemnification for cbeyond should any entity allege that cbeyond is violating its intellectual property 
should an entity bring suit or otherwise pursue intellectual property claims against us based on its own technology or the technology of third party vendors  the result of those claims could be to raise our costs or deny us access to technology currently necessary to our network or software systems 
if we are unable to generate the cash that we need to pursue our business plan  we may have to raise additional capital on terms unfavorable to our stockholders 
the actual amount of capital required to fund our operations and development may vary materially from our estimates 
if our operations fail to generate the cash that we expect  we may have to seek additional capital to fund our business 
if we are required to obtain additional funding in the future  we may have to sell assets  seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital 
in addition  the terms of our secured revolving line of credit with bank of america subjects us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and any other indebtedness we incur in the future is likely to include similar covenants 
if we do not comply with such covenants  our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings 
if we raise funds by selling more stock  our stockholders ownership in us will be diluted  and we may grant future investors rights superior to those of the common stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may have to delay  modify or abandon some of our expansion plans 
this could slow our growth  negatively affect our ability to compete in our industry and adversely affect our financial condition 
if we cannot negotiate new or extensions of existing interconnection agreements with local telephone companies on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide service to our existing customers and to expand our business 
we have agreements for the interconnection of our network with the networks of the local telephone companies covering each market in which we operate 
these agreements also provide the framework for service to our customers when other local carriers are involved 
we will be required to negotiate new interconnection agreements to enter new markets in the future 
in addition  we will need to negotiate extension or replacement agreements as our existing interconnection agreements expire 
most of our interconnection agreements have terms of three years  although the parties may mutually decide to amend the terms of such agreements 
if we cannot negotiate new interconnection agreements or renew our existing interconnection agreements on favorable terms or at all  we may invoke binding arbitration by state regulatory agencies 
the arbitration process is expensive and time consuming  and the results of an arbitration may be unfavorable to us 
if we are unable to 
table of contents obtain favorable interconnection terms  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our current and new markets 
our competitors may be better positioned than we are to adapt to rapid changes in technology  and we could lose customers 
the communications industry has experienced  and will probably continue to experience  rapid and significant changes in technology 
technological changes  such as the use of wireless network access to customers in place of the t access lines we lease from the local telephone companies  could render aspects of the technology we employ suboptimal or obsolete and provide a competitive advantage to new or larger competitors who might more easily be able to take advantage of these opportunities 
some of our competitors  including the local telephone companies  have a much longer operating history  more experience in making upgrades to their networks and greater financial resources than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain access to new technologies as quickly or on the same terms as our competitors  or that we will be able to apply new technologies to our existing networks without incurring significant costs or at all 
in addition  responding to demand for new technologies would require us to increase our capital expenditures  which may require additional financing in order to fund 
as a result of those factors  we would lose customers and our financial results could be harmed 
system disruptions could cause delays or interruptions of our service  which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses 
our success depends on our ability to provide reliable service 
although we have designed our network service to minimize the possibility of service disruptions or other outages  our service may be disrupted by problems on our system  such as malfunctions in our software or other facilities  overloading of our network and problems with the systems of competitors with which we interconnect  such as physical damage to telephone lines and power surges and outages 
although we have experienced isolated power disruptions and other outages for short time periods  we have not had any system disruptions of a sufficient duration or magnitude that would have a significant impact to our customers or our business 
any significant disruption in our network could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses 
business disruptions  including disruptions caused by security breaches  terrorism or other disasters  could harm our future operating results 
the day to day operation of our business is highly dependent on the integrity of our communications and information technology systems  and on our ability to protect those systems from damage or interruptions by events beyond our control 
sabotage  computer viruses or other infiltration by third parties could damage our systems 
such events could disrupt our service  damage our facilities  damage our reputation  and cause us to lose customers  among other things  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  a catastrophic event could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
catastrophic events could include a terrorist attack on the united states  or a major earthquake  fire  or similar event that affects our central offices  corporate headquarters  network operations center or network equipment 
we believe that communications infrastructures  such as the one on which we rely  may be vulnerable in the case of such an event  and our markets  which are metropolitan markets  or tier markets  may be more likely to be the targets of terrorist activity 
we have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the past and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements  cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price 
during and  management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as defined in the standards established by the 
table of contents american institute of certified public accountants  that affected our financial statements for each of the years in the four year period ended december  we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional material weaknesses  cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
we have not been profitable in the past and we may not continue to be profitable in the future 
we have experienced losses in the past 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of approximately million excluding the gain of million from the payoff of our debt 
although we recorded net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  this does not guarantee positive income in the future 
risks related to our common stock future sales of shares by existing stockholders or issuances of our common stock by us could reduce our stock price 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or we issue additional shares of common stock  par value per share  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we may also issue shares of our common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments 
if any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of shares that we issue may in turn be significant 
in addition  we may grant registration rights covering those shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price of our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware corporate law might deter acquisition bids for us that our stockholders might consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors  the inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  to act by written consent  to remove any director or the entire board of directors without cause  or to fill any vacancy on the board of directors  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our board of directors is also permitted to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
these provisions and other provisions under delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 

table of contents because we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
the continued expansion of our business will require substantial funding 
accordingly  we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on shares of our common stock 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  realization of a gain on stockholders investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares

adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net income  or cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  as a measure of performance or liquidity 
see non gaap financial measures for our reasons for including adjusted ebitda data in this report and for material limitations with respect to the usefulness of this measurement 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of total adjusted ebitda to net income loss year ended december  reconciliation of total adjusted ebitda to net income loss total adjusted ebitda for reportable segments depreciation and amortization non cash share based compensation public offering expenses interest income interest expense gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal loss on disposal of property and equipment other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss 
table of contents non gaap financial measures we use the total adjusted ebitda of our reportable segments as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business on a consolidated basis 
our chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker  also uses our segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses  gain recognized on troubled debt restructuring  gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal  loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
our total adjusted ebitda represents the sum of adjusted ebitda for each of our segments 
our total adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
our management uses total adjusted ebitda in its decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with gaap measures such as revenue and income from operations 
our calculation of total adjusted ebitda excludes  when applicable the gains related to our troubled debt restructuring in  public offering expenses incurred and the gain from the early payoff of our restructured debt in  and non cash share based compensation  loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense  none of which are used by management to assess the operating results and performance of our segments or our consolidated operations 
our management believes that total adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash share based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies 
we provide information relating to our total adjusted ebitda so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our total adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of the operating performance of our company on a consolidated basis and of our operating segments ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
in addition  total adjusted ebitda is a useful comparative measure within the communications industry because the industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies  as well as non operating or infrequent charges to earnings  such as the effect of debt restructurings 
accordingly  total adjusted ebitda allows analysts  investors and other interested parties in the communications industry to facilitate company to company comparisons by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
total adjusted ebitda as used in this report may not  however  be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 

table of contents our calculation of total adjusted ebitda is not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda 
in addition  total adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts  and any cash requirements for the replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized  which will often have to be replaced in the future  even though depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
total adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace operating income  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
rather  total adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance that you may consider in addition to those measures 
because of these limitations  total adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using total adjusted ebitda as a supplemental financial measure

overview we provide managed ip based communications services to our target customers of small businesses with to employees in selected large metropolitan areas 
we provide these services through bundled packages of local and long distance voice services  broadband internet services and mobile services  together with additional applications and services  for an affordable fixed monthly fee under contracts with terms of one  two or three years 
we currently operate in atlanta  dallas  denver  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  detroit and the san francisco bay area  and  beginning in the first quarter of  miami 
we sell three integrated packages of services  primarily delineated by the number of local voice lines  long distance minutes and t connections provided to the customer 
each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus additional value added applications 
customers may also choose to add extra features or lines for an additional fee 
beginning in the first quarter of  we started offering mobile services  which are integrated with our existing landline services 
our voice services other than our mobile voice services are delivered using voip technology  and all of such services are delivered over our secure all ip network  which we believe affords greater service flexibility and significantly lower network costs than traditional service providers using circuit switch technologies 
we offer our mobile voice and data services via our mobile virtual network operator relationship with a nationwide wireless network provider 
we believe our high degree of systems automation contributes to operational efficiencies and lower costs in our support functions 
we sell our services primarily through a direct sales force in each market  supplemented by sales agents 
these agents often have other business relationships with the customer and  in many cases  perform equipment installations for us at our customers sites 
a significant portion of our new customers are generated by referrals from existing customers and partners 
we offer financial incentives to our customers and other sources for referrals 
we compete primarily against incumbent local exchange carriers and  to a lesser extent  against competitive local exchange carriers  both of which are local telephone companies 
local telephone companies do not generally have the same focus on our target market and principally concentrate on medium or large enterprises or residential customers 
in addition  cable television providers have begun serving the small business market with telephone service  in addition to high speed internet access and video 
to date  we have not experienced significant competition from cable television providers and do not believe that they intend to offer the breadth of services and applications that our customers purchase from us 
we compete primarily based on our high value bundled services that bring many of the same managed services to our customers that have historically been available only to large businesses  as well as based on our customer care  network reliability and operational efficiencies 

table of contents we formed cbeyond and began the development of our network and business processes following our first significant funding in early we launched our first market early in and have since expanded operations into nine additional markets 
the following comprises the service launch date for our current markets and the anticipated launch date of our future announced markets current markets service launch date atlanta nd quarter dallas rd quarter denver st quarter houston st quarter chicago st quarter los angeles st quarter san diego st quarter detroit rd quarter san francisco bay area th quarter miami st quarter announced markets planned service launch date minneapolis rd quarter in future years  we generally expect to continue opening three new markets per year and intend to establish operations in the largest markets 
we focus on adjusted ebitda as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses  gains related to our troubled debt restructuring and our early payoff of the restructured debt  gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
in our presentation of segment financial results  adjusted ebitda for a geographic segment does not include corporate overhead expense and other centralized operating costs 
we believe that adjusted ebitda trends are a valuable indicator of our operating segments relative performance and of whether our operating segments are able to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
we believe our business approach requires significantly less capital to launch operations compared to traditional communications companies using legacy technologies 
based on our historical experience  over time  a substantial majority of our market specific capital expenditures are success based  incurred primarily as our customer base grows 
we believe the success based nature of our capital expenditures mitigates the risk of unprofitable expansion 
we have a relatively low fixed cost component in our budgeted capital expenditures associated with each new market we enter  particularly in comparison to service providers employing time division multiplexing  which is a technique for transmitting multiple channels of separate data  voice and or video signals simultaneously over a single communication medium  or circuit switch technology  which is a switch that establishes a dedicated circuit for the entire duration of a call 
the nature of the primary components of our operating results revenues  cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses are described below revenue the majority of our customers subscribe to our beyondvoice i package  which serves customers with local voice lines  or generally or fewer employees 
we also sell subscriptions of beyondvoice ii to customers with local voice lines  or generally employees 
our beyondvoice iii package is typically offered to 
table of contents customers with employees 
each beyondvoice i customer receives all our services over a dedicated broadband t connection providing a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps megabits per second 
beyondvoice ii customers receive their services over two dedicated t connections offering a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps 
beyondvoice iii customers receive their services over three dedicated t connections offering a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps 
we believe that our customers highly value the level of symmetric bandwidth offered with our services 
as of december   approximately of our customer base had beyondvoice i  had beyondvoice ii  and had beyondvoice iii 
average monthly revenue per customer location was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in average monthly revenue per customer location is impacted by a variety of factors  including the distribution of customer installations during a period  the adoption by customers of applications for which incremental fees are paid  the trend toward customers signing three year contracts at lower package prices as compared to shorter term contracts  the amount of long distance call volumes that may generate overage charges above the basic amount of minutes included in customers packages as well as additional terminating access charges and customer usage and purchase patterns 
we expect average monthly revenue per customer location to be relatively stable in future periods 
customer revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers represented the majority of the remainder of total revenues 
customer revenues are generated under contracts that typically run for three year terms 
therefore  customer churn rates have an impact on projected future revenue streams 
throughout our history  we have maintained monthly churn rates of approximately  but have recently experienced elevated rates attributable  primarily  to deteriorating economic conditions 
specifically  we experienced an average monthly churn rate of in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of we expect an elevated level to continue through at least the first quarter of in response to deteriorating economic conditions  we have taken steps which we believe will mitigate the risk of heightened churn and bad debt levels on a longer term basis 
these steps include a tightening of credit and collection policies and practices for customers with a higher risk profile 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue represents costs directly related to the operation of our network  including payments to the local telephone companies and other communications carriers such as long distance providers and our mobile provider  for access  interconnection and transport fees for voice and internet traffic  customer circuit installation expenses paid to the local telephone companies  fees paid to third party providers of certain applications such as web hosting services  collocation rents and other facility costs  telecommunications related taxes and fees  and the cost of mobile handsets 
the primary component of cost of revenue is the access fees paid to local telephone companies for the t circuits we lease on a monthly basis to provide connectivity to our customers 
these access circuits link our customers to our network equipment located in a collocation facility  which we lease from local telephone companies 
the access fees for these circuits vary by state and are the primary reason for differences in cost of revenue across our markets 
as a result of the trro  we are required to lease circuits under special access  or retail  rates in locations that are deemed to offer competitive facilities as outlined in the fcc s regulations and interpreted by the state regulatory agencies 
for additional discussion  see results of operations revenue and cost of revenue 
where permitted by regulation  we lease our access circuits on a wholesale basis as une loops or extended enhanced loops as provided for under the fcc s telecommunications elemental long run incremental cost rate 
table of contents structure 
we employ une loops when the customer s t circuit is located where it can be connected to a local telephone company s central office where we have a collocation  and we use extended enhanced links when we do not have a central office collocation available to serve a customer s t circuit 
historically  approximately half of our circuits are provisioned using a combination of une and special access loops and half using extended enhanced links  although the impact of the trro has reduced our usage of the t transport portion of extended enhanced links and resulted in the conversion of a majority of the previously installed t transports to ds transports 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using une loops rather than extended enhanced links  but une loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office collocation equipment 
both une loops and extended enhanced loops offer significant cost advantages over special access based circuits 
we install central office collocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch operations in a new market with several collocations and add additional collocation facilities over time as we confirm the most advantageous locations in which to deploy the equipment 
we believe our discipline of leasing these t access circuits on a wholesale basis rather than on the basis of special access rates from the local telephone companies is an important component of our operating cost structure 
we receive service credits from various local telephone companies to adjust for prior errors in billing  including the effect of price decreases retroactively applied upon the adoption of new rates as mandated by regulatory bodies 
these service credits are often the result of negotiated resolutions of bill disputes that we conduct with our vendors 
we also receive payments from the local telephone companies in the form of performance penalties that are assessed by state regulatory commissions based on the local telephone companies performance in the delivery of circuits and other services that we use in our network 
because of the many factors  as noted  that impact the amount and timing of service credits and performance penalties  estimating the ultimate outcome of these situations is uncertain 
accordingly  we recognize service credits and performance penalties as offsets to cost of revenue when the ultimate resolution and amount are known 
these items do not follow any predictable trends and often result in variances when comparing the amounts received over multiple periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for employees and other expenses related to sales and marketing  engineering  information technology  billing  regulatory  administrative  collections and legal and accounting functions 
in addition  share based compensation expense is included in selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include both fixed and variable costs 
fixed selling expenses include salaries and office rents 
variable selling costs include commissions and marketing collateral 
fixed general and administrative costs include the cost of staffing certain corporate overhead functions such as it  marketing  administrative  billing and engineering  and associated costs  such as office rent  legal and accounting fees  property taxes and recruiting costs 
variable general and administrative costs include the cost of provisioning and customer activation staff  which grows with the level of installation of new customers  and the cost of customer care and technical support staff  which grows with the level of total customers on our network 
as we expand into new markets  certain fixed costs are likely to increase  however  these increases are intermittent and not proportional with the growth of customers

total revenue increased for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  in proportion to the increase in the average number of customers year over year and a slight increase in average monthly revenue per customer location from the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december  we expect average monthly revenue per customer location to be relatively stable in future periods 
revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers increased for the twelve month comparison period 
these terminating access charges grew substantially less than our customer base during the current year due to reductions in access rates on interstate calls as mandated by the fcc 
these rate reductions were anticipated and are expected to continue in the future

cost of revenue increased for the twelve month period of compared to the twelve month period of in proportion to the increase in the average number of customers year over year 
as a percentage of total revenue  cost of revenue slightly increased to in the twelve months ended december  from in the twelve months ended december  circuit access fees  or line charges  which primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of collocation to our equipment located at our customers premises  represented the largest component of cost of revenue 
the increase in circuit access fees is correlated to the increase in the number of customers as well as a rise in circuit access fees due to the impact of the trro described below  however  these costs are offset by savings related to our ongoing network optimization efforts 
the other principal components of cost of revenue include long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of transport circuits between network points of presence  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party applications we provide to our customers  access costs paid by us to other carriers to terminate calls from our customers and certain taxes and fees  and the costs of mobile handsets 
as a percent of revenue  other costs of service increased for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to the impact of the growth in our mobile service offering 
the rates charged by ilecs for our high capacity circuits in place on march  that were affected by the fcc s new rules were increased effective for one year until march in addition  by march   we were required by the fcc s new rules to transition these existing facilities to alternative arrangements  such as other competitive facilities or to other wholesale arrangements offered by the ilecs eg  special access services or other negotiated rates with ilecs 
subject to any contractual protections under our existing interconnection agreements with ilecs or amendments to such agreements  beginning march   new circuits that were added were subject to the ilecs higher special access pricing 
new circuits include any new installations of ds loops and or ds and ds transport facilities in the affected ilec wire centers  on the affected transport routes or that exceeded the caps 
beginning on march   we began estimating and accruing the difference between the new pricing resulting from the trro and the pricing being invoiced by ilecs 
we continue to accrue certain amounts relating to the implementation of the trro due to billing rates that continue to reflect pre trro pricing 
a substantial amount of these accrued expenses have never been invoiced by the ilecs and are subject to a two year statutory back billing limit 
during twelve months ended december  approximately million of trro expenses accrued from march  through december  passed the statutory back 
table of contents billing limit and were reversed as a benefit to cost of revenue 
for the portion of the accrued trro expenses that have been invoiced as of december   we have been billed million in excess of the amount that has been cumulatively recognized in our results of operations 
management believes these excess billings are erroneous and that the amounts accrued represent the best estimate of the final settlement of these liabilities 
we estimated the probable liability for implementation of certain provisions of the trro and accrued approximately million through december  and million through december  for these liabilities 
due to the trro provisions  million and million was charged to cost of revenue in the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively 
these estimates are for all markets and  where alternate pricing agreements have not been reached  are based on special access rates available under volume and or term pricing plans 
we believe volume and or term pricing plans are the most probable pricing regime to which we are subject to based on our experience and our intent to enter into volume and or term commitments where more attractively priced alternatives do not exist 
certain aspects of the new fcc rules are subject to ongoing court challenges and estimates relating to the implementation of the new fcc rules are subject to multiple interpretations 
we cannot predict the results of future court rulings  how the fcc may respond to any such rulings or any changes in the availability of unbundled network elements as the result of future legislative or regulatory decisions 
transport charges have increased as a percentage of revenue to from for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  as a result of network optimization efforts aimed to reduce future transport costs 
we recorded million in installation expenses from network architecture changes associated with the trro and an additional million for additional network optimization efforts inspired by the trro related project in the twelve months ended december  the network optimization project undertaken in response to the trro was completed in the quarter ended june  however  additional network optimization efforts continue  including the planned migration of portions of our network traffic in to company owned transport facilities acquired under indefeasible rights of use contracts 
we recorded million in installation expenses resulting from network optimization efforts in the twelve months ended december  and believe that these network optimization efforts will be an ongoing part of our business in future periods  although they are not expected to result in significant installation expenses in each period

annual selling  general and administrative expenses increased for compared to primarily due to increased employee costs 
higher employee costs  which includes commissions paid to our direct sales representatives  principally relate to the additional employees necessary to staff new markets and to serve the growth in customers 
as a percentage of consolidated revenues  the increase in is fully attributable to new markets  as is illustrated above 
new markets for include san diego  detroit  san francisco bay area and miami 
corporate selling  general and administrative costs includes an increase of million in share based compensation for the twelve months ended december   including million of employer contributions to the k plan that began in as the newer markets mature  we expect selling  general and administrative costs in these markets to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our customer base and revenues grow without proportional increases in these expenses 
marketing costs  including advertising  increased in absolute dollars but are relatively consistent as a percent of revenues 
in general our marketing costs will continue to increase as we add customers and expand to new markets 
other selling  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes and bad debt expense 
this increase in absolute dollars in this category of costs is primarily due to the addition of new as well as expanded operations needed to keep pace with the growth in customers 
as a percentage of revenue  other selling  general and administrative costs slightly decreased for the twelve month period ended december  when compared to the comparable period of due to realizing efficiencies from achieving economies of scale 
we expect this positive trend to continue 
the continuing deterioration of general economic conditions resulted in an increase in the number of customers disconnected for non payment  causing an increase in the customer churn rate and an increase in bad debt expense to million in  from million in  or of revenues in each year  of which 
table of contents million was recognized in the fourth quarter of in response to the changing economic environment  we tightened our credit and collections policies and practices for customers with a higher risk profile

interest expense increased for the twelve months ended december  compared to as the credit facility was not outstanding for the full period in loss on disposal of property and equipment 
loss on disposal of equipment for the twelve month period ended december  and principally consists of unrecoverable integrated access devices from disconnected customers and write offs of certain network and software assets that we replaced due to obsolescence or upgrade 
the loss on unrecoverable integrated access devices will continue to increase as our customer base grows and will vary with customer churn rates as well 
the write off of certain network and software assets will fluctuate dependent upon management decisions to replace and upgrade components of our network 
income tax expense 
in and until the fourth quarter of  the majority of our taxable income was offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from prior years and a full valuation allowance  or reserve  on the remaining net deferred tax assets 
income tax expenses recognized relate primarily to amounts due under the alternative minimum tax rules or to states where we either do not have net operating loss carryforwards or the taxing regime does not consider net operating losses 
income tax expense for the twelve month period ended december  also reflects a million benefit arising from the release of a portion of our valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax asset  which was entirely recognized in the fourth quarter 

table of contents our net deferred tax asset totals approximately million at december  and primarily relates to net operating loss carryforwards 
due to our history of losses  we had fully reserved for this net deferred tax asset in past periods 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence present  such that we will be able to utilize a portion of these loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income  resulting in a partial reduction of the reserves against the asset to reflect the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 
in order to realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset recognized  we will need to generate approximately million in taxable income prior to  which  based on current projected performance  management expects to be able to meet

cost of revenue increased for the twelve month period of compared to the twelve month period of  mostly attributable to the increase in the average number of customers year over year 
the remaining increase in cost of revenue  as well as the increase as a percentage of revenue  relates primarily to the impact of regulatory changes and increased level of installation charges to affect circuit changes in connection with our network optimization plan in response to the trro 
circuit access fees  or line charges  which primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of collocation to our equipment located at our customers premises  represented the largest component of cost of revenue 
the increase in circuit access fees is a direct result of the increase in the number of customers  as well as a rise in circuit access fees due to the impact of the trro and regulatory rulings in georgia 
the other principal components of cost of revenue include long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of transport circuits between network points of presence  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party applications we provide to our customers  access costs paid by us to other carriers to terminate calls from our customers and certain taxes and fees  and  beginning in  the costs of mobile handsets 
as a percent of revenue  other costs of service increased for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to the impact of our network grooming activities  which involve changes in network architecture to improve efficiency or reduce costs related to the trro described below  and the impact of our new mobile offering  which involves subsidies on the sale of mobile handsets and a lower gross margin for mobile service than our overall gross margin 
in february  the georgia public service commission the psc ordered a rate increase for the lease of unbundled network elements provided by bellsouth 
the increased rates were applicable both prospectively and retroactively to june we estimated and accrued approximately million through december  for the cumulative impact of this action  which was charged to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of prior to the psc staff recommendation  there was insufficient information as to whether the outcome of this matter would result in a change in pricing and whether such change in pricing  if any  would be applied retroactively or prospectively 
in february  the fcc issued its trro and adopted new rules  effective march   governing the obligations of ilecs  to afford access to certain of their network elements  if at all  and the cost of such facilities 
the trro reduces the ilecs obligations to provide high capacity loops within  and dedicated transport facilities between  certain of the ilecs wire centers that are deemed to be sufficiently competitive  based upon various factors such as the number of fiber based collocators and or the number of business access lines within these wire centers 
in addition  certain caps are imposed regarding the number of unbundled network element  or 
table of contents une  facilities that companies like us may have on a single route or into a single building 
where the wire center conditions or the caps are exceeded  the trro eliminates the ilecs obligations to provide these high capacity circuits to competitors at the discounted rates historically received under the telecommunications act 
the rates charged by ilecs for our high capacity circuits in place on march  that were affected by the fcc s new rules were increased effective for one year until march in addition  by march   we were required by the fcc s new rules to transition these existing facilities to alternative arrangements  such as other competitive facilities or to other wholesale arrangements offered by the ilecs eg  special access services or other negotiated rates with the ilecs

we cannot predict the results of future court rulings  or how the fcc may respond to any such rulings  or any changes in the availability of unbundled network elements as the result of future legislative or regulatory decisions 
we made changes in our network architecture via a network optimization project to mitigate the increases in transport circuit costs resulting from the fcc rule changes 
this network optimization project  undertaken in response to the trro  was completed in the quarter ended june  and resulted in million in installation expenses during the six months ended june   which included million for additional network optimization efforts inspired by the trro related project 
these additional network optimization efforts continued during the remainder of  in which we incurred an additional million in installation expenses 
we believe that these network optimization efforts will be an ongoing part of our business in future periods  although they may not result in significant installation expenses in each period

selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding share based compensation expense  increased at a slower rate than our revenue or customers for the twelve month period ended december  this change is evidenced by its decline as a percentage of revenue to in the twelve month period ended december  from in the twelve month period ended december  as shown in the table below  this decrease was greater after considering the effects of new markets  including los angeles and san diego for also affecting the trends in selling  general and administrative expenses are our introduction of mobile services in all markets during the first quarter of and increased cost associated with being a public company 
salaries  wages and benefits  which include commissions paid to our direct sales representatives  comprised the largest portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses for all comparison periods 
the primary factor increasing this category of costs was the increase in employees as the company grows 
however  the growth in the cost of benefits  such as medical insurance payments made by us  per employee  caused this expense line item to grow at a faster rate than the number of employees 
marketing costs  including advertising  increased in absolute dollars  as we have increased our marketing efforts into new mediums to address the increasingly competitive environment  but decreased as a percent of revenues

other selling  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes and bad debt expense 
the increase in this category of costs was primarily due to the addition of new operations needed to keep pace with the growth in customers and the cost of being a public company  including preparing for sarbanes oxley act compliance  and professional fees associated with a heightened level of regulatory activity

our corporate group is treated as a separate segment consistent with the manner in which we monitor and analyze our financial results 
we do not allocate these corporate costs to the other segments because these costs are managed and controlled on a centralized  functional basis that spans all markets  with centralized  functional management held accountable for corporate results 
we also believe that the decision not to allocate these centralized costs provides a better evaluation of our revenue producing geographic segments 
we do not report assets by segment since we manage our assets and make decisions on technology deployment and other investments on a company wide rather than a local market basis 
our chief operating decision maker does not use segment assets in evaluating the performance of our operating segments 
as a result  we do not believe that segment asset disclosure is meaningful information to investors 
in addition to segment results  we use total adjusted ebitda to assess the operating performance of the overall business 
because our chief operating decision maker primarily evaluates the performance of our segments on the basis of adjusted ebitda  we believe that segment adjusted ebitda data should be available to investors so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
our chief operating decision maker also uses revenue to measure our operating results and assess performance  and both revenue and adjusted ebitda are presented herein in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
other public companies may define adjusted ebitda in a different manner or present varying financial measures 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda as presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda is also not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda 
adjusted ebitda  while management believes provides useful information  should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to other financial measures determined under gaap  such as operating income or loss 
the operating results from our operating segments reflect the costs of a pre launch phase in each market in which the local network is installed and initial staffing is hired  followed by a startup phase  beginning with the launch of service operations  when customer installations begin 
our sales efforts  our service offerings and the prices we charge customers for our services are generally consistent across our operating segments 
operating expenses include costs of service and selling  general and administrative costs incurred directly in the markets where we serve customers 
although our network design and market operations are generally consistent across all our operating segments  certain costs differ among the various geographical markets 
these cost differences result from different numbers of network central office collocations  prices charged by the local telephone companies for customer t access circuits  prices charged by local telephone companies and other telecommunications providers for transport circuits  office rents and other costs that vary by region

we commenced operations in until  we funded our operations primarily through issuance of an aggregate of million in equity securities and borrowings under a line of credit facility established with cisco capital  used principally to purchase property and equipment from cisco systems 
in  we recorded positive cash flow from operating activities for the first time 
we raised million from issuance of equity securities in december and another approximately million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in november total outstanding borrowings  of million  which were all with cisco capital  were repaid in november with proceeds from our initial public offering  and the credit facility was terminated 
cash flows from operations 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  is primarily comprised of an increase in net income of million  an increase in non cash share based compensation of million  an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of million  an increase of million from accounts payable and an increase of million from accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease of million from the deferred tax benefit  a decrease of million from other liabilities  and a decrease of million from our change in inventory 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in from is primarily comprised of an increase in net income of million  an elimination of million in interest expense associated with the reduction in carrying value in excess of principal from the restructuring of a portion of our cisco capital debt in  an increase of million in non cash share based compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million resulting from the growth in assets arising from the growth in customers and the addition of assets needed to support our newer markets  which included houston  chicago and los angeles  an increase of million related to the non cash gain recognized upon the payoff of our credit facility with cisco capital in  an increase of million from other assets  an increase of million from prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase of million in other accrued expenses 
these increases in cash flow from operations were primarily offset by a decrease of million in accounts payable  a decrease of million from accounts receivable and a decrease of million from our change in inventory 
cash flows from investing activities 
our principal cash investments are historically for purchases of property and equipment and for purchases of marketable securities 
cash purchases of property and equipment primarily include network capital expenditures such as integrated access devices  t aggregation routers  trunking gateway routers  softswitches  other network routers  associated growth expenditures related to these items  diagnostic and test equipment  certain collocation and data center buildout expenditures and equipment installation costs and non network capital expenditures  such as the cost of software licenses and implementation costs associated with our operational support systems as well as our financial and administrative systems  servers and other equipment needed to support our software packages  personal computers  internal communications equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to our office space 
our cash purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in and prior periods  network related capital expenditures were primarily financed through our credit facility with cisco capital and  accordingly  were non cash transactions 
after giving consideration to non cash purchases of property and equipment  capital expenditures increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  and increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  our capital expenditures resulted from growth in customers in our existing markets  network additions needed to support our entry into new markets  and enhancements and development costs related to our operational support systems in order to offer additional applications and services to our customers 
we expect that future capital expenditures will continue to be concentrated in these areas 
we believe that capital efficiency is a key advantage of the ip based network technology that we employ 
in addition to the above  we experienced an increase of million in net cash flows from investment redemptions and purchases for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and a decrease of million in net cash flows from investment redemptions and purchases for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we periodically invest excess cash balances in the marketable securities of highly rated commercial paper and money market funds 
purchases of marketable securities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we periodically redeem our marketable securities in order to transfer the funds into other operating and investing activities 
we redeemed million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non cash purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment through our credit facility with cisco capital  which terminated in november  were recorded as non cash purchases because they were directly financed by cisco capital without the exchange of cash for the assets that we purchased 
network capital expenditures include the purchase of integrated access devices  t aggregation routers  trunking gateway routers  softswitches  other network routers  associated growth expenditures related to these items  
table of contents diagnostic and test equipment  certain collocation and data center buildout expenditures and equipment installation costs 
our non cash additions to property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as noted above  the balance of our debt under the cisco capital credit facility was repaid in november using a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering and the facility was terminated 
therefore  there were no non cash purchases of property and equipment after november relating to our credit facility with cisco capital 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows provided from financing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the principal component of the change in cash flow provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended december  is the increase of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and the increase in the excess tax benefit relating to share based compensation of million 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in the year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  the principal component of cash flows provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
the primary use of cash in the year ended december  was the repayment of long term debt and capital leases of million offset by proceeds from our initial public offering of approximately million 
we had no payments on long term debt in or due to the payoff of our debt after our initial public offering in november we believe that cash on hand plus cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  operating expenses and other cash requirements associated with our present market expansion plan  which is to continue opening three new markets per year 
our business plan assumes that cash flow from operating activities of our mature markets will offset the negative cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from financing activities with respect to the additional markets we plan to launch 
we intend to adhere to our policy of fully funding all future market expansions in advance and do not anticipate entering markets without having more than sufficient cash on hand or borrowing capacity to cover projected cash needs

the credit agreement terms were subsequently amended on 
table of contents july  the following description of the line of credit briefly summarizes the facility s terms and conditions that are material to us 
as of december   there were no amounts drawn down on the line of credit

table of contents transfer assets  change our fiscal reporting periods or method of accounting  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the revolving line of credit also contains certain customary representations and warranties  affirmative covenants  notice provisions  indemnification and events of default  including change of control  cross defaults to other debt and judgment defaults 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies we prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  the following involved a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are therefore considered critical 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue derived from local voice and data services is billed monthly in advance and deferred until earned at the end of the month 
revenues derived from other telecommunications services  including long distance  excess charges over monthly rate plans and terminating access fees from other carriers  are recognized monthly as services are provided and billed in arrears 
mobile headset revenue is recognized at the time of shipment utilizing the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to mobile handsets equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
our marketing promotions include various rebates and customer reimbursements that fall under the scope of eitf issue no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
in accordance with these pronouncements  we record these promotions as a reduction in revenue when earned by the customer 
when these promotions are earned over time  we ratably allocate the cost of honoring the promotions over the period required for eligibility as a reduction in revenue 
eitf also requires that measurement of the obligation should be based on the 
table of contents estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the promotion 
accordingly  we recognize the benefit of estimated breakage on customer promotions when such amounts are reasonably estimable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts through charges to selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance is established based upon the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and is estimated based on a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience and the general economic environment 
customer accounts are typically written off against the allowance approximately sixty days after disconnection of the customers service  when our direct collection efforts cease 
generally  customer accounts are considered delinquent and the service disconnection process begins when they are sixty days in arrears 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of our expenses could result 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the asset s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards no 
 sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
under this guidance  we recognized non cash compensation expense for share based awards by measuring the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock and amortizing that excess on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the applicable share based awards 
additional paid in capital and deferred compensation were recorded at the date of the grants to reflect the intrinsic value of the awards 
under apb  the deferred compensation was amortized to expense over the vesting periods on a straight line basis  with adjustments for forfeitures as they occurred 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized on or after january  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under sfas r  compensation is recorded over the vesting period directly to paid in capital 
thus  upon adoption  we eliminated the deferred compensation balance relating to employee share based awards with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital 
as of december  and december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested awards totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and years 
we evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions each time we estimate the fair value of equity instruments requiring measurement under sfas r 
to assist us in validating our assumptions  we periodically engage consultants with relevant experience to assess and evaluate our assumptions 

table of contents the risk free interest rate used in estimating the fair value of share based awards is based on the us treasury zero coupon securities using the contractual term of the share based awards 
we also use historical data to estimate the suboptimal exercise barrier and the forfeiture rate of share based awards granted 
through the third quarter of  we had not been a public company long enough to rely on our own volatility history 
therefore our expected volatility was based on historical volatilities experienced by companies considered representative of us based on four primary categories size  stage of lifecycle  capital structure and industry 
this approach to estimating volatility remained consistent over time  although the mix and weighting of representative volatilities were refined periodically to ensure that the four primary categories were appropriately considered 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began using our own market based historical volatility 
in reviewing the modifications to the development of our underlying valuation assumptions  we consider whether applying the refined assumptions would have had a material impact on recent valuations performed using the previous assumptions  noting that the effect on compensation expenses would not have resulted in a materially different amount 
through  we granted only stock options to our employees 
beginning in  we expanded our share based compensation to include grants of restricted shares as well as a k match and contribution to be paid in company stock 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
we made assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and  allowable deductions 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws could materially impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset is designed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  it provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted fin effective january   and the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides guidance regarding accounting for certain taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing 
table of contents transactions between a seller and a customer 
these taxes and surcharges include  among others  universal service fund charges  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
we have historically presented and will continue to present universal service fund charges on a gross basis 
such amounts totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for us beginning in and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this standard allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that unrealized gains and losses for that instrument shall be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for us in we do not expect that we will elect the fair value option under sfas  and we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to investments we may make in marketable securities 
we place our marketable securities investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
at december   all investments were in money market funds and  accordingly  had no financial instruments sensitive to market risk for fluctuations in interest rates
