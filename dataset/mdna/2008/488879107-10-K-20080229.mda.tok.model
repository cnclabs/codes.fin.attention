item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we provide software  services and proprietary content that enable organizations to more effectively recruit and retain employees 
our solutions are built around a suite of easily configurable software applications that automate talent acquisition and employee performance management best practices 
we offer the software applications that form the core of our solutions on an on demand basis  which materially reduces the costs and risks associated with deploying traditional enterprise applications 
we complement our software applications with tailored combinations of outsourcing services  consulting services and proprietary content based on our years of experience assisting clients in addressing their human resource requirements 
together  our software applications and services form solutions that we believe enable our clients to improve the effectiveness of their talent acquisition programs  increase employee productivity and retention  measure key hr metrics and make their talent acquisition and employee performance management programs more efficient 
since  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
for the years ended december  and  revenue from these subscriptions comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
these subscription based solutions provide us with a recurring revenue stream and we believe represent a more compelling opportunity in terms of growth and profitability than discrete professional services 
as a result  since discrete professional services have represented a consistently decreasing percentage of our revenue 
we expect that trend to continue 
we sell our solutions to large and medium sized organizations through our direct sales force 
as of december   we had a client base of approximately  companies  including approximately companies on the fortune list published in april in  we increased our client base to approximately  companies  including approximately companies on the fortune list published in april our client base includes companies that we billed for services during the year ended december  and does not necessarily indicate an ongoing relationship with each such client 
our top clients contributed approximately million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  our revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately since  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  historically  a substantial portion of our clients have renewed their subscriptions each year 
during the years ended december   and  our clients renewed approximately or higher respectively  of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts up for renewal during each of those periods 
background we commenced operations in as a provider of recruiting services to a wide variety of industries 
in  we offered our first automated talent acquisition system and by we had expanded our business to 
table of contents provide employee research  employee performance management technology and consulting services 
in late  responding to a growing demand from our customers  we embarked on a strategy to provide comprehensive human capital management services integrated with on demand software 
between and  we acquired businesses that collectively enabled us to offer comprehensive hcm services integrated with on demand technology 
in  we commenced a strategy designed to focus our business on talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions and reduce our strategic focus on discrete professional services that generated less predictable revenue streams and lower margins 
to that end in  we exited our temporary staffing business  in and  we acquired four businesses which enhanced our screening and behavioral assessment solutions and skills testing technologies  since  we have reduced our strategic focus on position specific recruiting services  in  we discontinued our oracle implementation business and discontinued and sold our pharmaceutical training division  in  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with scottworks solutions  inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and client base through our acquisitions of webhire  inc  knowledge workers inc  gantz wiley research  psychometric services ltd  and brassring inc  and in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and client base through our acquisitions of strategic outsourcing corporation and hrc human resources consulting 
as a result of our shift in strategic focus in  an increasing proportion of our revenue has been derived from talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions while a decreasing portion of our revenue has been derived from discrete professional services 
in  revenue derived from subscriptions for these solutions comprised approximately of our total revenue  in this percentage increased to of total revenue 
this shift to subscription based services has been driven by our customer s adoption of the on demand model for software delivery and need for solutions that improve employee recruiting and retention 
from our inception through  our operations were funded primarily through internally generated cash flows and our line of credit 
in december  we issued common stock and warrants to purchase common stock to several investors  including parthenon investors  lp and pcip investors  for approximately million 
in connection with this investment  we repurchased common stock held by a co founder and former president of our predecessor for consideration of approximately million and restructured our outstanding debt 
on june   we entered into a bridge financing in which we issued promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of million to parthenon and pcip for aggregate cash proceeds of million  representing an original initial issue discount of million 
in connection with the bridge financing  parthenon and pcip also exercised warrants to purchase shares of common stock that were acquired in the financing for an aggregate exercise price of million 
in february  we issued common and preferred stock to wafra acquisition fund  lp for approximately million and to parthenon and pcip in exchange for the cancellation and discharge of the bridge notes issued in in march  we issued common and preferred stock to westbury equity partners sbic  lp for approximately million in cash 
in the same transaction  we redeemed a portion of the shares of common and preferred stock held by parthenon and pcip for an aggregate price of approximately million 
in december  we conducted a share repurchase which closed on january  in the aggregate  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from eight former employees at per share  of which  were repurchased in december we decided to initiate the process for our initial public offering after this share repurchase had been completed 

table of contents our initial public offering on june   we completed our initial public offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  including  shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option on july   at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from our initial public offering aggregated approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement that we entered into prior to our initial public offering with the holders of all of our class b common stock  class c common stock  series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock and as provided for in our articles of incorporation in effect prior to our initial public offering  all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and class c common stock automatically converted into  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  at the closing of our initial public offering 
under the terms of this agreement  we also redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock for a combination of an aggregate of approximately million and million  respectively  in cash  and the issuance of  and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to this agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of warrants held by certain of our principal shareholders in connection with our initial public offering 
in connection with the redemption and conversion transactions described above  we incurred charges of million due to the accretion on our class b common stock  class c common stock  series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock and million due to accrued dividends on our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 
recent transactions on february   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
the timing  price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
the stock repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares  and we may terminate the repurchase program at any time 
on november   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock  of which million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million as of december  the timing  price and volume of repurchases were based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
as of december  the amount of shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan was million 
through january   the remaining million shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
on august   we acquired hrc human resources consulting gmbh hrc  a leading consultancy for business orientated employee surveys  based in munich  germany  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the total cost of the acquisition  including legal  accounting  and other professional fees of million  was approximately million 
the acquisition of hrc provides us with a presence in germany and enhances our expansion in european countries 
on june   we acquired strategic outsourcing corporation straightsource  a provider of recruitment process outsourcing services  based in richardson  texas  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash and million in stock consideration 
the total cost of the acquisition was approximately million 
we expect that the acquisition of straightsource will provide additional efficiency to our exempt and non exempt recruitment offering and expand our distribution capabilities in the southwest market 
in addition  the acquisition agreement contained an earnout provision which provided for the payment of additional consideration by the company based upon the annual revenues of straightsource through december  based upon these results  we paid an additional consideration of million in cash and stock during the first quarter of to the former shareholders of straightsource 
the related liability has been accrued in the financial statements at december  
table of contents on march   we entered into a first amendment to the credit agreement with pnc bank 
the amendment increased the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility portion of the credit agreement from million to million  including a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit 
the amendment provides that the credit agreement will terminate  and all borrowings will become due and payable  on march  on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we also sold an additional  shares of our common stock to cover over allotments of shares 
our net proceeds from the offering  after payment of all offering expenses and commissions  aggregated approximately million 
we repaid all of the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility with a portion of the net proceeds from the offering 
sources of revenue we derive revenue primarily from two sources subscription revenue for our solutions  which is comprised of subscription fees from clients accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from clients purchasing additional support that is not included in the basic subscription fee  and fees for discrete professional services 
our clients primarily purchase renewable subscriptions for our solutions 
the typical term is one to three years  with some terms extending up to five years 
the majority of our subscription agreements are not cancelable for convenience although our clients have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to provide the agreed upon services or otherwise breach the agreement 
a client does not generally have a right to a refund of any advance payments if the contract is cancelled 
we expect that we will maintain our renewal rate of approximately of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts subject to renewal for  and the revenue derived from subscription fees is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
we generally invoice our clients in advance in monthly or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our clients pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable prior to the receipt of payment and in deferred revenue to the extent revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
as the subscription component of our revenue has grown and clients willingness to pay us in advance for their subscriptions has increased  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has grown 
as of december   deferred revenue increased to million from million at december  we generally price our solutions based on the number of software applications and services included and the number of client employees 
accordingly  subscription fees are generally greater for larger organizations and for those that subscribe for a broader array of software applications and services 
we derive other revenue from the sale of discrete professional services  and translation services as well as from out of pocket expenses 
the majority of our other revenue is derived from discrete professional services  which primarily consist of consulting and training services 
this revenue is recognized differently depending on the type of service provided as described in greater detail below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was derived from sales in the united states 
revenue that we generated from clients in the netherlands and the united kingdom and canada  germany and switzerland amounted to an aggregate of and  respectively  for the year ended december  revenue for other country s amounted to an aggregate of 
other than the countries listed no other country was in excess of of our total revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees and independent contractors who provide consulting or other professional services to our clients 
additionally  our application hosting costs  amortization of third party license royalty costs  technical support personnel costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses are also recorded as cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends  changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses and fluctuations in our client base 
because cost as a percentage of revenue is higher for professional services than for software products  an increase in the services component of our solutions or an increase in discrete professional services as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
as our business expands  we expect that third party license royalty costs and personnel costs associated with the delivery of our solutions will continue to increase 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing  including salaries  commissions  and other variable compensation  travel expenses and costs associated with trade shows  advertising and other marketing efforts and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time the related revenue is recognized  and we recognize revenue from our subscription agreements ratably over the terms of the agreements 
investment in sales and marketing commencing in resulted in significant revenue growth during   and we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new clients and expand relationships with existing clients 
our sales and marketing expense has increased in absolute terms although it has decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
we expect this trend to continue 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs  including salaries  and employee benefits  for software engineers  quality assurance engineers  product managers  technical sales engineers and management information systems personnel 
our research and development efforts have been devoted primarily to enhancements and upgrades to our existing products 
historically  we have capitalized a small percentage of our research and development expenses 
capitalized research and development expenses totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the remaining research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we employ more personnel to support enhancements of our solutions and new solutions offerings 
in addition  we expect research and development expenses to increase as a percentage of total revenue primarily due to the expansion of our research and development efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
as we expand our business and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company  we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may decrease as a percentage of total revenue in and future periods 

table of contents key performance indicators the following tables summarize the key performance indicators that we consider to be material in managing our business for the year ended december  in thousands  except for percentages total revenue subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue income from operations before income tax and interest expense net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue the following is a discussion of some of the terms used in the tables above 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue can be derived from our consolidated statement of operations 
this performance indicator illustrates the evolution of our business towards subscription based solutions  which provide us with a recurring revenue stream and which we believe to be a more compelling revenue growth and profitability opportunity 
we expect that the percentage of subscription revenue will be in the range of of our total revenues through at least net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities is taken from our consolidated statement of cash flows and represents the amount of cash generated by our operations that is available for investing and financing activities 
historically  our net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded our net income primarily due to the positive impact of deferred revenue 
we expect this trend to continue because of the advance payment structure of our subscription agreements and because as our sales increase  we expect incremental costs to decline 
deferred revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions 
we recognize revenue from these subscription agreements ratably over the term of the contract  which are typically one to three years 
we generally invoice our clients in quarterly or monthly installments in advance 
deferred revenue  which is included in our consolidated balance sheets  is the amount of invoiced subscriptions in excess of the amount recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue represents  in part  the amount that we will record as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
as the subscription component of our revenue has grown and customer willingness to pay us in advance for their subscriptions has increased  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has grown 
we expect this trend to continue 
the following table reconciles beginning and ending deferred revenue for each of the periods shown for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue at the beginning of the year total invoiced subscriptions during the year deferred revenue from acquisition subscription revenue recognized during the year deferred revenue at end of year 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources subscription revenues for solutions  which are comprised of subscription fees from clients accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from clients purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and other fees for professional services  translation services and reimbursed out of pocket expenses 
because we provide our solutions as a service  we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
on august   we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
subscription fees and support revenues 
subscription fees and support revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the lives of the contracts 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recorded subscription fees and support revenues of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other revenue 
other revenue consists of discrete professional services  translation services and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
discrete professional services  when sold with subscription and support offerings  are accounted for separately since these services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the delivered elements 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
additionally  when professional services are sold with other elements  the consideration from the revenue arrangement is allocated among the separate elements based upon the relative fair value 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are rendered 
in determining whether revenues from professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription revenue  we consider the following factors for each agreement availability of professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature and the timing of when the agreement was signed in comparison to the subscription agreement start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the other services 
if the professional service does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the professional service over the same period as the revenue is recognized 

table of contents we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred in accordance with eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses be classified as revenue and not as cost reductions 
before the december  effective date of eitf issue  out of pocket reimbursements from clients were netted with the applicable costs 
these items primarily include travel  meals and certain telecommunication costs 
for the years ended december    and  reimbursed expenses totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from clients inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific clients that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these clients  we perform ongoing reviews of all clients that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
in addition  we have experienced significant growth in number of clients  and we have less payment history to rely upon with these clients 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new clients and evaluate these clients over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
capitalized software research and development costs in accordance with eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  we apply aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  will be capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
maintenance and training cost are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal software in any of the periods covered in this audit report 
goodwill and other identified intangible asset impairment on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which superseded accounting board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of existing goodwill and are required to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment 
if goodwill becomes impaired  some or all of the goodwill could be written off as a charge to operations 
this comparison is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carry amount 
we have reviewed the carrying values of goodwill of each business unit by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the business components 
the fair value is based on management s estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the respective business components and comparable company multiples 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry 
changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates  which in turn could affect the recoverability of goodwill 
we determined that the carrying values of our goodwill did not exceed the fair values and as a result we do not believe that impairment of goodwill existed at december  
table of contents accounting for share based compensation we use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award and is based on a weighted average of peer companies  comparable indices and our stock volatility 
an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is currently based upon an average of the contractual life and the vesting period of the options 
with the passage of time actual behavioral patterns surrounding the expected term will replace the current methodology 
changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase in our expense 
the estimated forfeiture rate is the rate at which awards are expected to expire before they become fully vested and exercisable 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would result in a decrease to our expense 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest 
in determining the share based compensation expense to be recognized  a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award 
this rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on our historical employee behavior 
changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate 
a decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported subject to certain stop loss provisions 
we estimate our liability based upon management s judgment and historical experience 
we also rely on the advice of consulting administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
as of december   and  self insurance accruals totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of insurance expense if actual experience differs significantly from management s estimates

the acquisitions of hrc and straightsource comprised approximately of the increase in our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our other revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in demand for our consulting services which resulted from an increase in our subscription based revenues 
we expect subscription based and other revenues to increase in over the prior year due to primarily customer acquisitions and additional sales to existing customers 
cost of revenues cost of revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue remained approximately the same at for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the cost of revenue was primarily due to increased salaries  overhead  direct costs and other expense of million  million  million and million  respectively  associated with our increased revenue 
our increased salaries were due in part to the addition of employees from our acquisitions in and sales and marketing s m s m expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  increased  increased staff related expense including performance bonuses and commissions and travel expense contributed of million and million  respectively  to the increase in s m expense from the prior year

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to increased capital purchases and additional intangibles acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions 
in the future  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase due to recent capital purchases 
interest income interest income increased million or for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase is due primarily to interest earned on the net proceeds of our january public offering in which we raised million 
income tax expense income tax expense on continuing operations increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income before taxes 
changes to deferred income taxes are generally based on management s evaluation of our positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and the determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of the benefits of federal and state tax assets 
webhire  which we acquired in january  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of september  brassring  which we acquired in november  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of december  based upon the uncertainty of our ability to utilize these acquired net operating losses  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   webhire and brassring made retroactive elections under section g of the internal revenue code with the effect of increasing the tax basis of acquired intangible 
table of contents assets to the deemed purchase price of these assets 
we will amortize the increased tax basis of acquired intangibles over a year period for federal and state income tax purposes 
separate gains equal to the respective increases in tax basis were included in the pre acquisition taxable incomes of each acquired company 
webhire and brassring each had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to fully offset the income recognized on the deemed sale of assets for regular federal income tax purposes 
however  under the federal alternative minimum tax rules  net operating loss carryforwards may not offset more than of income taxable under this measure 
we have therefore paid alternative minimum tax on these gains of approximately million 
concurrent with the recognition of these gains  certain of the acquired net operating losses were deemed to expire

our subscription revenue increased in every quarter presented from million for the three months ended march  to million for the three months ended december  our other revenue increased from million for the three months ended march  to million for the three months ended december  we believe that subscription revenue increased more quickly than other revenue due to our continuing shift in focus toward subscription based solutions and away from discrete professional services 
cost of revenues cost of revenue for the quarters presented has fluctuated between and based on the mix of sales between subscription revenue and other revenue 
cost of revenue was highest as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended september  this was caused by the mix of sales included in other revenue in that quarter

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
r  business combinations fas r and fas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
fas 
changes for business combination transactions pursuant to fas r include  among others  expensing of acquisition related transaction costs as incurred  the recognition of contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value and capitalization of in process research and development assets acquired at their acquisition date fair value 
changes in accounting for noncontrolling minority interests pursuant to fas include  among others  the classification of noncontrolling interest as a component of consolidated shareholders equity and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations 
fas r and fas are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of fas r will impact the accounting for our future acquisitions 
we do not believe the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on january   we adopted the financial accounting standard board s interpretation no 
 accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
as of december  and december   we had an insignificant amount of unrecognized tax benefits  none of which would materially affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
our policy is to 
table of contents recognize interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
the amount of interest and penalties for the year ended december  was insignificant 
tax years beginning in are subject to examination by taxing authorities  although net operating loss and credit carryforwards from all years are subject to examinations and adjustments for at least three years following the year in which the attributes are used 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our total revenue was comprised of sales to clients in the united states 
a key component of our business strategy is to expand our international sales efforts  which will expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a change in the value of the us dollar relative to each of the currencies of our non us generated sales would not have resulted in a material change to our results for the year ended december  the financial position and operating results of our foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency 
local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date  and the local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the us dollar during the period 
the related translation adjustments were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are included in other comprehensive income 
the foreign currency translation adjustment is not adjusted for income taxes as it relates to an indefinite investment in a non us subsidiary 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our cash equivalents  which consist solely of money market funds  are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant effect on our interest income for the year ended december
