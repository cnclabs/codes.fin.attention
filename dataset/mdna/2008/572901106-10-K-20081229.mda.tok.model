item business 
overview martek biosciences corporation is a leader in the innovation and development of omega dha products that promote health and wellness through every stage of life 
the company produces life sdha  a vegetarian source of the omega fatty acid dha docosahexaenoic acid  for use in infant formula  pregnancy and nursing products  foods and beverages  dietary supplements and animal feed  and life sara  a vegetarian source of the omega fatty acid ara arachidonic acid  for use in infant formula 
nutritional products we have developed production methods and intellectual property for two important fatty acids  dha and ara 
we sell oils containing these fatty acids as life sdha  dhasco  neuromins  arasco and life sara 
we derive dha from microalgae and ara from fungi  using proprietary processes 
cell membranes throughout the body contain these fatty acids  and they are particularly concentrated in the brain  central nervous system  retina and heart 
research has shown that dha and ara may enhance mental and visual development in infants 
in addition  research has shown that dha may play a pivotal role in brain function throughout life and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease 
low levels of dha in adults have been linked to a variety of health risks  including alzheimer s disease  dementia and increased cardiovascular problems 
further research is underway to assess the role of supplementation with our dha on mitigating a variety of health risks 
adults may obtain dha via a limited number of foods such as fish  eggs or organ meats 
ara may be obtained from foods such as red meats  fish and eggs 
pregnant women transfer dha and ara through the placenta to the fetus and lactating mothers pass dha and ara to infants through breast milk 
while there are currently no universally recognized guidelines for daily consumption of dha  several international scientific and health agencies have made recommendations for dha and ara consumption for infants and for dha intake for pregnant and nursing women 
a workshop in sponsored by the international society for the study of fatty acids and lipids as well as others recommended that adults consume at least mg of dha daily 
us department of health and human services data indicate that dietary consumption of dha is well below this level 
we believe that greater recognition of this possible dietary deficiency will result in an increase in demand for dha supplemented products 
recommendations for ara consumption by adults have not been put forth and may not be necessary as adequate amounts of ara are likely consumed in the typical adult diet 
investigators at a number of research institutions  including the national institutes of health nih  have observed a relationship between low levels of dha and a variety of health risks  including increased cardiovascular problems  alzheimer s disease and dementia and various other neurological and visual disorders 
we sponsor and participate with others in research to determine the benefit of dha supplementation on cardiovascular health  alzheimer s disease and dementia 
additionally  martek continues to support and provide oils for multiple ongoing clinical trials designed to further explore the benefits of dha supplementation during pregnancy and nursing to assess the outcomes on both mother and child 
in may  the food and drug administration fda completed a favorable review of our generally recognized as safe gras notification for the use of our dhasco and arasco oil blend in specified ratios in infant formulas 
since the first united states infant formula product introduction in february  infant formulas supplemented with martek s dha and ara manufactured by six of our licensees have been sold in the united states mead johnson nutritionals under the enfamil lipil brand  abbott laboratories under its similac advance brand  nestle under its good start supreme dha ara brand  pbm products inc under the brands bright beginnings  vermont organics and under private label brands  including wal mart parent s choice  hain celestial under the brand earth s best  and nutricia north america under the brand neocate 
these supplemented infant formulas include term  preterm  soy based  specialty and toddler products 
as of october   we estimate that formula supplemented with our oils had penetrated almost all of the us infant formula market 
we have entered into license agreements with over infant formula manufacturers  who collectively represent approximately of the estimated billion worldwide retail market for infant formula and nearly of the estimated billion us retail market for infant formula  including the retail value of women  infants and children program wic rebates 
wic is a federal grant program administered by the states for the benefit of low income  nutritionally at risk women  infants and children 
our licensees include infant formula market leaders mead johnson nutritionals  nestle  abbott laboratories  wyeth and danone formerly numico  each of whom is selling infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils 
our licensees are now selling infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries 
supplemented infant formulas manufactured by mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  pbm products  nestle  hain celestial and nutricia north america are currently being sold in the united states 
in addition  certain licensees are selling products in the united states and abroad that contain our nutritional oils and target the markets for children ages nine months to seven years of age and older  as well as pregnant and nursing women 

table of contents in addition to the dha we sell for use in infant formula  martek has developed certain separate and distinct dha technology  which we refer to as dha s  that is derived from a different algal strain than our dha authorized for addition to infant formula 
we have received a favorable review by the fda of our gras notification for the use of dha s in food and beverage applications in the us and have received similar approvals in canada 
we have also received authorization from the ministry of health in china subject to certain conditions and the australia new zealand food authority for the use of dha s oil in all foods and authorization from the european commission and israel for the use of our dha s oil as a novel food ingredient 
this novel food designation authorizes the use of our dha s as an ingredient in certain foods such as certain dairy products  including cheese and yogurt but not milk based drinks  spreads and dressings  breakfast cereals  food supplements and dietary foods for special medical purposes in the european community and israel 
dha algal oil is also regarded as a traditional food in japan and  as such  is acceptable for use in foods and beverages and dietary supplements 
we are currently selling dha s products into the dietary supplement  food and beverage  pregnancy and nursing and animal feed markets domestically and internationally 
furthermore  we have signed dha license and supply agreements with several large food and beverage companies  many of whom have launched products containing martek s dha 
our infant formula dha and our dha s are each marketed under the brand life sdha 
to date  over domestic and international companies have launched non infant formula products that contain life sdha  most of which remain on the market and are believed to be meeting customer expectations 
certain of our dha license and supply agreements with major consumer food products companies establish martek  subject to certain exceptions  as their exclusive supplier of dha for minimum periods of time 
contract manufacturing we provide certain contract manufacturing services at our kingstree  south carolina facility 
the facility s large fermentation capacity and numerous types of recovery equipment allow us to customize production processes for our customers and produce at significant volumes 
our contract manufacturing services are particularly well suited for the contracted production of enzymes  specialty chemicals  vitamins and agricultural specialty products 
during fiscal  the company anticipates reducing the scope of its contract manufacturing activities focusing more of its resources on the company s higher margin nutritional oils business 
products and product candidates nutritional oils infant formula applications certain microalgae and fungi produce large quantities of oils and fats containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  known as lcpufas  that are important to human nutrition and health 
we have identified strains of microalgae that produce oils rich in dha and have developed the means to grow them by fermentation 
in addition  we have isolated and cultured a strain of fungus that produces large amounts of ara 
dha is the predominant omega fatty acid in the brain and retina of the eye and is a key component of heart tissue in humans and other mammals 
both dha and ara are important for infant brain and eye development which occurs primarily in the last trimester in utero  and continues throughout the first few years of life 
during pregnancy  dha and ara are actively transported from the mother to the fetus via the placenta 
following birth  the infant receives these fatty acids from either breast milk which always contains dha and ara or infant formula supplemented with dha and ara 
with dha supplemented infant formula  formula fed infants have blood and tissue levels of dha that are similar to those of breastfed infants 
dha and ara supplementation is especially important for premature infants who failed to complete the last trimester of pregnancy in utero 
dha and ara were added to us infant formulas beginning in  and martek s dha and ara continue to be the only dha and ara included in infant formula in the us fish oils can also be used for dha supplementation in infant formula 
however  we believe that for a number of reasons our dha oil is more desirable for infant formula applications than fish oil or other sources of dha 
our oils are derived from a vegetarian source and are grown under tightly controlled conditions 
as a result  martek oils do not contain contaminants such as methylmercury  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and dioxins that may be found in certain fish oils 
our oils do not contain significant quantities of eicosapentaenoic acid epa  an omega fatty acid found in fish oil which certain studies indicate is not appropriate for consumption by infants in high levels 
both algal and fish oils contain dha and are in the form of easily digestible triglycerides similar to the major form found in breast milk 
martek oils have the further benefit  however  of higher oxidative stability and longer shelf life than certain fish oils

birch and others published in in developmental medicine child neurology  which noted the results of a national institutes of health nih sponsored study that showed a significant improvement in mental development in term infants given a commercially available infant formula supplemented with martek dha and ara compared to infants fed the same formula  but without dha and ara 
in the double blind study  infants fed the diet supplemented with our oils showed  at months of age  a mean increase of points on the mental development index mdi of the bayley scales of infant development ii 
researchers reported that these data support a long term cognitive advantage of infant dietary dha supply during the first months of life 
the significant correlationssupport the hypothesis that early dietary supply of dha was a significant determinant of improved performance on the mdi

coordinated international expert group  authored by dr 
b 
koletzko and others published in journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition in november  in which the international expert group  in view of beneficial effects  supported the optional addition of lcpufas to infant formula 
their guidelines specify that the optional addition of dha should not exceed of total fat  ara contents should be at least the same concentration as dha  and the epa content should not exceed that of dha 
feeding preterm infants after hospital discharge a commentary by the espghan committee on nutrition  authored by dr 
p 
aggett and others published in journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition in may the espghan committee on nutrition reviewed available evidence and established recommendations for feeding preterm infants after hospital discharge 
the committee recommended that formula fed infants born prematurely should receive infant formula that provides lcpufas for optimal growth and development 
martek dha and ara are lcpufas added to preterm and term infant formula in the us and worldwide

in addition  due to the success of supplemented infant formula  several of our licensees are selling extension products containing our oils beyond infant formula that are targeted for children ages nine months to seven years of age and older 
nutritional oils non infant formula applications applications for pregnant and nursing women dha is transferred from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy and particularly during the last trimester 
following birth  the mother transfers dha to her newborn through breast milk 
therefore  an adequate intake of dha during pregnancy and nursing is thought to be important and many public health agencies such as the world health organization who and international society for the study of fatty acids and lipids issfal have made recommendations for dha intake during the perinatal period 
in addition  other experts have specified certain minimum levels of lcpufa intake during pregnancy as follows during the perilip meeting  a european union supported consensus conference on dietary fat intake during the perinatal period september  germany  the following recommendation was made regarding dha consumption pregnant and lactating women should aim to achieve a dietary intake of n lcpufa 
omega long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid 
that supplies a dha intake of at least mg day 
these recommendations and overall results of the perilip project were published in the british journal of nutrition november 
a consensus report by dr 
b 
koletzko and others published in january in the journal of perinatal medicine recorded the recommendations of international experts in maternal and pediatric nutrition regarding the importance of lcpufas 
the committee recommended that pregnant and lactating women should aim to achieve an average daily intake of at least mg dha 
when breastfeeding is not possible for a term infant  the committee recommended use of an infant formula providing dha at levels between and weight percent of total fat  and with the minimum amount of ara equivalent to the contents of dha 
the september issue of the journal of the american dietetic association included a position statement from the american dietetic association and dietitians of canada regarding dietary fatty acids 
the groups emphasized the importance of dha during pregnancy  lactation  and infancy and its particular importance for neural development and function 
the groups also reviewed the importance of long chain omega fatty acids for health and recommend that adults consume mg of long chain omega fatty acids daily 
supplementation of breastfeeding mothers with dha has shown to increase the level of dha found in breast milk 
studies have shown a benefit for breastfed infants of dha supplemented mothers as indicated below a study reported by dr 
c 
jensen and others published in july in the american journal of clinical nutrition noted that infants of mothers who supplemented with life sdha while breastfeeding had improved psychomotor skills at years of age 
the study revealed that children of dha supplemented mothers scored significantly higher on the bayley psychomotor development index pdi  when compared to the children of the non supplemented breastfeeding mothers 
the study also confirmed that dha supplementation while breastfeeding effectively increases dha levels in the mother s milk as it noted that the mothers supplemented with dha had more dha in their breast milk than the control group and their infants had higher dha blood levels than the control group infants 
this study was partially funded by martek 
a study published by dr 
j 
cohen and others in november in the american journal of preventive medicine provided a statistical analysis of many studies which had examined maternal fatty acid intake and effect on infant development 
the results of the analysis showed that increases in maternal dha intake are associated with modest improvements in child iq 
additional research is underway to further evaluate dha supplementation during pregnancy and nursing 
we are currently providing dha oils to multiple researchers who are evaluating potential benefits of maternal dha supplementation during pregnancy and nursing on pregnancy outcomes and infant development 

table of contents other human applications investigators at universities around the world and at other research centers  such as nih  have observed a relationship between low levels of dha and a variety of health risks  including increased cardiovascular problems  alzheimer s disease and dementia and various other neurological and visual disorders 
we are currently trying to establish what contribution  if any  supplementation with our oils will make in addressing these problems 
we  as well as others  are supporting studies to further investigate the potential benefit of dha supplementation on cardiovascular health  and we  as well as others  including nih  are conducting research regarding the impact of dha supplementation on certain visual and neurological disorders

the study found that a diet rich in dha significantly lessened the memory loss and cell damage associated with alzheimer s disease in laboratory mice 
in  this laboratory extended their findings using dha in the european journal of neuroscience 
the authors reported how dietary essential fatty acids may influence cognition and alzheimer s disease risk 
in july  the results of a study conducted by dr 
mc morris and others published in the archives of neurology indicated that weekly consumption of fish and dietary intake of dha  but not other omega fatty acids  are associated with a reduced risk of alzheimer s disease by up to percent 
the study examined whether fish consumption and the associated intakes of omega fatty acids would afford a protective effect against alzheimer s disease 
the study showed that in those individuals consuming the highest amounts of dietary dha  the risk of developing alzheimer s disease was reduced by up to percent 
the risk of developing alzheimer s disease was not correlated with epa consumption 
additional research is needed to evaluate the role  if any  of dha supplementation in reducing the risk of developing these diseases

schwellenbach and others published in december in the journal of the american college of nutrition compared martek s life sdha algal oil to dha plus epa fish oil for their ability to lower triglycerides in subjects with coronary artery disease and elevated triglycerides  most of whom were undergoing statin therapy 
both supplements significantly lowered triglycerides  but only life sdha increased high density good cholesterol 
the authors concluded that there was no added benefit provided by epa for lowering triglycerides at this level 
the authors of the study also indicated that life sdha was better tolerated by the study participants than fish oil  noting that a greater proportion of subjects in the fish oil group reported fishy taste as a problem with their treatment 
a study published by dr 
a 
erkkil and others in september in the journal of lipid research noted an important relationship between plasma dha levels and the reduced progression of cardiac disease

holub reported in may in the american journal of clinical nutrition that dha supplementation of postmenopausal women with life sdha resulted in a reduction in triglycerides  a increase in hdl cholesterol good cholesterol and a reduction in heart rate relative to placebo 
in may  in the publication circulation  the american heart association aha issued a scientific statement entitled fish consumption  fish oil  omega fatty acids  and cardiovascular disease 
the scientific statement outlines the findings of a comprehensive report that examined the cardiovascular health benefit of omega fatty acids  specifically dha and epa  from fish sources 
the report concluded that consumption of such omega fatty acids  either through diet or supplements  reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease 
the statement refers to studies that have indicated the following to be associated with the intake of omega fatty acids decreased risk of sudden death and arrhythmia  decreased thrombosis blood clot  decreased triglyceride levels  decreased growth of atherosclerotic plaque  improved arterial health  and lower blood pressure 
the scientific statement concluded that omega fatty acids have been shown in epidemiological and clinical trials to reduce the incidence of heart disease and recommends that healthy individuals eat a variety of fish preferably oily at least twice a week 
the statement cautioned  however  that fish intake must be balanced with concerns about environmental pollutants because some species of fish may contain significant levels of methylmercury  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  dioxins  and other contaminants 
both the fda and the environmental protection agency have advised children  pregnant women  women who may become pregnant and nursing mothers to limit their intake of certain fish 
in consideration of the health risks posed by such contaminants  the authors of the statement conclude by stating  the availability of high quality omega fatty acid supplements  free of contaminants  is an important prerequisite to their extensive use 
martek s dha oil is derived from a vegetarian source and is free of contaminants that may be found in certain fish oils 
in september  the fda announced that it would allow conventional foods and beverages and dietary supplements containing dha and epa to make a qualified health claim for reduced risk of coronary heart disease on their product packaging 
a qualified health claim must be supported by credible scientific evidence 
upon review of this scientific evidence  the fda concluded that supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of dha and epa may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease 
this qualified health claim supports the benefit of martek s dha s oil  as it contains both dha and small amounts of epa 
while there is not yet a scientific consensus on the subject  a number of clinical studies  including several listed above  have indicated that dha provides the main cardioprotective benefits traditionally ascribed to fish consumption or to the combination of dha plus epa 
such research has indicated that dha  in the absence of epa  may have the following effects on cardiovascular risk factors reduces triglycerides and raises the hdl or good cholesterol  reduces blood pressure  reduces heart rate  and increases ldl and hdl cholesterol particle size 
other discussed below are the findings of studies that highlight the benefits of dha on other human applications 
an independent observational study by dr 
jm norris and others published in september in the journal of the american medical association was designed to determine whether the intake of omega and omega fatty acids is associated with the development of type diabetes in children 
this study was conducted with children known to be at genetic risk for developing type diabetes 
results showed that the omega fatty acid levels were inversely correlated with the risk for developing diabetes in this group of at risk children 
these investigators are further investigating this relationship in an ongoing clinical trial to determine whether dha  specifically  has a role in type diabetes prevention 
a study by dr 
k 
connor and others published in july in nature medicine reported that increasing consumption of long chain omega fatty acids  including dha  reduces destructive vascularization in the retina 
in this animal study of retinopathy associated with prematurity  the authors summarize a series of experiments demonstrating that long chain omega fatty acids  and selected metabolites  are effective in reducing retinal vascular disease  which is a leading cause of blindness 
a portion of these studies included martek oils as the source of long chain fatty acids

we are in discussions with many companies to sell products containing our dha oils for cognitive function  cardiovascular health and other applications 
to date  over domestic and international companies have launched non infant formula products that contain life sdha  most of which remain on the market and are believed to be meeting customer expectations see sales and marketing below 
we  along with our customers and certain third parties  are developing other dha delivery methods  including powders and emulsions  to facilitate further entry into the non infant formula markets 
management believes that over the next few years  the non infant formula markets will continue to expand and could ultimately represent a larger opportunity than infant formula 
our sales of nutritional oils for products outside of infant formula uses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
contract manufacturing we provide contract manufacturing services at our kingstree  south carolina production facility 
we began offering these services following our september acquisition of fermpro manufacturing  lp  which had been providing third party manufacturing services since the mid s 
during this time period  kingstree personnel have developed an expertise in large scale fermentation with many different microorganisms  including algae  bacteria  fungi and yeast 
martek s kingstree plant has certain fermentation capacity designated for use in contract manufacturing 
kingstree also has numerous types of recovery equipment which allow us to efficiently customize production processes and state of the art microbiological and analytical laboratories which provide highly automated product testing capabilities 
our facilities are especially well suited for the contracted production of enzymes  specialty chemicals  vitamins  agricultural specialty products and intermediates 
our contract manufacturing customers have ranged from relatively small specialty chemical companies without in house production capabilities to very large  multinational pharmaceutical companies who require back up manufacturing capabilities or prefer a distinct site for the manufacture of a particular product line 
our contract manufacturing revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our contract manufacturing services continue to include only products with expected reasonable profit margins or those that we believe could have a strategic fit in the future 
during fiscal  the company anticipates reducing the scope of its contract manufacturing activities focusing more of its resources on the company s higher margin nutritional oils business 
technology martek is a leading innovator in the development of nutritional lcpufa products that promote health and wellness throughout every stage of life 
we leverage our knowledge of microalgae and other microorganisms and expertise in fermentation sciences and natural product isolation to develop commercially attractive  proprietary and environmentally sustainable sources of nutrients which have proven or emerging health benefits 
these processes and use of the products derived from these processes form the basis of our intellectual property estate 
product development involves four major activities discovery  process development and product formulation  product safety and efficacy evaluation  and scale up and commercial production 
discovery having established an appropriate nutritional product target  martek screens its large database of live and preserved  genetically diverse microalgal species to identify candidate microalgal producers 
martek s culture collection consists of microalgal strains that have been isolated from nature by martek s scientists and those that have been obtained from both public and private culture collections 
martek s culture collection also includes non microalgal microbial species  which we believe may be increasingly important in the development of future products 
martek s microorganisms have a range of physiological and biochemical characteristics which naturally produce many different lipids  carbohydrates and proteins 
promising candidates are further developed and screened for their ability to meet desired product requirements within the desired cost structure 

table of contents process development and product formulation commercial processes for production of candidate products are developed by martek s scientists and engineers 
martek s processes consist of several basic steps including microbial culture inoculum germination and expansion  fermentation  and product isolation and purification 
martek s scientists utilize a broad range of technical skills and equipment of progressively larger scale to develop reproducible and economical processes 
we apply standard industrial microbiological techniques to microorganisms  including classical strain development and culture condition growth medium composition  temperature  ph manipulation to optimize product yield and productivity 
martek s expertise in oil processing is broadly applicable to a number of nutrients which are lipid soluble 
finally  martek develops suitable liquid and dry powder product forms to enable our customers to utilize our products in a broad range of desired consumer products 
martek has invested in extensive lab and large pilot scale fermentation and product recovery equipment to enable efficient and cost effective product development and to support on going product cost reduction efforts 
while we do not utilize genetically engineered microorganisms in the production of current commercial products  in the future we may use genetic engineering technology for the production of products at lower cost or with improved functionality 
for example  martek successfully isolated the genes responsible for producing dha in one commercial strain of microalgae  and is developing  with a corporate collaborator  the use of these genes to produce low cost seed oil dha and lcpufa products in transgenic terrestrial oilseed crops 
product safety and efficacy evaluation in the course of product development  products undergo thorough safety testing and evaluation to assure our ability to reproducibly produce products that are safe and compliant with worldwide regulatory requirements 
all commercial products are produced utilizing good manufacturing practices gmp conditions appropriate for the intended food and beverage  supplement  or pharmaceutical market 
the health benefits and efficacy of our products are tested and demonstrated utilizing appropriate preclinical animal models and human clinical studies 
these studies are conducted by martek  academic researchers and or corporate partners affiliated with martek and currently focus on the areas of brain development  cognitive function  cardiovascular health  immune system health  inflammation  eye development and eye health 
results from these studies are used to establish and support product claims for market development 
scale up and commercial production successful exploitation of the unique characteristics of microalgae and certain other microorganisms is in large measure dependent upon the availability of large scale culturing technology 
we have successfully scaled up several strains of microalgae capable of producing large amounts of dha heterotrophically using common organic nutrients and salts 
heterotrophic culturing of these dha producing microalgae at commercially viable levels enables significantly lower production costs to be achieved  which were not possible prior to our achievements 
aspects of our technology for the heterotrophic growth of dha producing microalgae are the subject of many us and international patents and patent applications 
martek employs a systematic process to identify  develop  prosecute and defend commercially valuable intellectual property 
collaborative and licensing agreements we have entered into license agreements with over infant formula manufacturers  who collectively represent approximately of the estimated billion worldwide retail market for infant formula and nearly of the estimated billion us retail market for infant formula  including the retail value of women  infants and children program wic rebates 
wic is a federal grant program administered by the states for the benefit of low income  nutritionally at risk women  infants and children 
our licensees include infant formula market leaders mead johnson nutritionals  nestle  abbott laboratories  wyeth and danone formerly numico  each of whom is selling infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils 
our pricing for these licensees generally follows two models 
under the large majority of these agreements  we receive a transfer price per kilogram upon the sale of our oils to our licensees 
for a limited number of such agreements  we receive a lower transfer price on sales of our oils to our licensees plus ongoing royalties based on our licensees sales of infant formula products containing our oils 
the most significant license agreements have remaining terms ranging from approximately nine to years  contain no future purchase commitments from our licensees  and  generally  may be terminated by our licensees upon proper notification  which  in certain cases  only requires short notice periods 
in many license agreements  our licensees have the right to buy other sources of dha and or ara oils 
however  in some cases  the licensees would pay us greater amounts for the dha or ara that they purchase from us 
since  we have entered into long term supply agreements with four of our significant customers mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  danone formerly numico and wyeth 
in general  these supply agreements establish  with limited exceptions  martek as the exclusive supplier of all dha and ara for the respective licensee s infant formula products 
these agreements have terms of either ten or years with certain rights for either party to terminate the arrangement as of january  provided that the requisite prior written notice is given 
with the exception of danone  whose agreement established a new license arrangement with martek with a year term  the original license agreements remain in effect and have been incorporated into the new supply agreements 
along with other exclusive dha and or ara supply agreements entered into over the last three years with other infant formula licensees  martek now has sole source commitments  subject to limited exceptions  through at least december  with customers that comprise nearly of martek s current infant formula revenues 
under the terms of the licensing agreements  our licensees are responsible for obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals with respect to the use of these nutritional oils in infant formula products 
under each of our current license agreements  our licensees generally are obligated to indemnify us against product liability claims relating to our nutritional oils unless our nutritional oils do not meet agreed upon specifications 
under the terms of several of our license agreements  we are prohibited from granting a license to any party for the inclusion of our nutritional oils in infant formula with commercial terms that are more favorable to such licensee than those provided in our agreements with our current licensees without either the prior written consent of the current licensees or prospectively offering such new favorable terms to these licensees 

table of contents since fiscal  the company has entered into several license and supply agreements permitting the use of life sdha in various non infant formula applications  including foods and beverages and pregnancy and nursing applications 
certain of these agreements are for terms of years and establish martek  subject to certain exceptions  as the licensees exclusive provider of dha for minimum periods of time 
there are no minimum purchase requirements or other financial commitments to martek under these agreements 
certain other of these license and supply agreements are non exclusive in nature and the licensee is able to purchase life sdha on an as needed basis  subject to certain limitations 
these non exclusive arrangements generally include product pricing to the licensee that is higher than the pricing to our licensees that have agreed to use martek s life sdha on an exclusive basis 
in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with dsm food specialties bv dsm extending the existing relationship between the two companies involving the production and supply of ara  one of our nutritional oils that we sell to our infant formula licensees 
among other things  this agreement provides for the grant to martek by dsm of a license related to certain technologies associated with the manufacture of ara 
this grant involved a license fee totaling million  which is being amortized over the year term of the agreement using the straight line method 
the agreement with dsm  as amended  also provides for the granting to dsm by us of an exclusive license under certain of our patents and intellectual property rights for the production by dsm of products containing ara for non human applications  including animal feed products as well as for certain limited human applications 
in addition  we and dsm have agreed to contribute our complementary resources to cooperative marketing and joint research and development efforts to expand the applications and fields of use for ara  with both parties sharing any economic benefits of such efforts 
the original agreement was amended in  and as discussed below in production 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with a canadian biotechnology company to co develop dha products from plants 
in january  an amendment to this agreement was executed  whereby we acquired exclusive license rights to the plant based dha technology developed by the co collaborator for a period of at least years 
as consideration for this exclusive license  we made a license payment of  subject to minimum royalties of of gross margin  as defined  on future sales by us of such plant based dha 
during the term of the license  we may be required to pay additional royalties of up to of gross margin  as defined  on sales of products in the future which utilize certain licensed technologies 
to further our plant based dha initiatives  in may  we entered into a collaborative agreement with a global biotechnology company to jointly develop and commercialize a canola seed that produces dha 
we and our co collaborator anticipate a multi year effort to produce this oil 
our financial commitments associated with this development initiative are subject to the successful completion of identified milestones 
as of october   our financial commitment  primarily through internal research efforts  to the first projected milestone date totals approximately million 
commitments thereafter  also primarily through internal research efforts  assuming successful achievement of all identified milestones  total approximately million 
we have also entered into various additional collaborative research and license agreements 
under these agreements  we are required to fund research or to collaborate on the development of potential products 
as of october   we had no material commitments to fund any future development activities under these arrangements 
production we manufacture oils rich in dha at our production facilities located in winchester  kentucky  and in kingstree  south carolina 
the oils that we produce in these facilities are certified kosher by the orthodox union and are certified halal by the islamic food and nutrition council of america 
both manufacturing facilities have received favorable ratings by the american institute of baking  an independent auditor of food manufacturing facilities and have obtained the iso environmental management system ems international standard  the most recognized ems standard in the world 
also  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has granted martek s winchester plant  the company s primary shipping location  a health certificate  which is required for import of products into many countries  including china and neighboring countries in the pacific rim 
in october  we restructured our plant operations following a review of the company s production and cost structure 
under the restructuring  a substantial portion of production formerly taking place in winchester was transferred to kingstree 
we plan to maintain the essential redundancy of dual plant manufacturing capacity in order to mitigate production risk and to meet future customer demand 
we believe that we can bring the winchester assets back to full production in a matter of months if required by customer demand 
over of our ara oils are purchased from dsm as manufactured at its capua  italy and belvidere  new jersey plants 
because dsm is a third party manufacturer  we have only limited control over the timing and level of its capua and belvidere production volumes 
the balance of our ara requirements is produced at our kingstree facility 
under our agreement with dsm  annual ara unit pricing is calculated utilizing a cost plus approach that is based on the prior year s actual costs incurred adjusted primarily for current year volume and cost expectations and  to a limited extent  adjusted for certain current year actual expenses 
in february  we and dsm entered into an amendment to the original agreement the amendment 
the amendment established the overall economics associated with dsm s expansion at both its belvidere  new jersey and capua  italy production facilities 
in july  we and dsm entered into a second amendment to the original agreement the amendment 
the amendment finalized ara pricing to us for calendar as well as the parameters and methodologies for the establishment of ara pricing for calendar years  and  if certain criteria are met  the amendment also established minimum ara purchase quantities for us during calendar years and as part of the amendment  we guaranteed the recovery of certain costs incurred by dsm in connection with these expansions  up to million  with such amount being reduced annually through december  the recoupment period based upon ara purchases by us in excess of specified minimum thresholds 
the guarantee amount payable  if any  would be credited against a portion of dsm invoices for purchases made after the recoupment period 
in may  we and dsm entered into an amendment to change the payment terms of the guarantee 
in connection with this amendment  it was agreed that in full satisfaction of the guarantee  we will commit to purchasing certain minimum quantities of ara during the period january  through september  as of october   the value of the remaining calendar and minimum purchase quantities is approximately million with such minimum volumes approximating the amounts expected to be purchased by martek in the normal course of business 

table of contents we have attempted to reduce the risk inherent in having a single supplier  such as dsm  through certain elements of our supply agreement with dsm 
in connection with this agreement  we have the ability to produce  either directly or through a third party  an unlimited amount of ara 
the sale of such self produced ara is limited annually  however  to the greater of i tons of ara oil or ii any amounts ordered by us that dsm is unable to fulfill 
we have demonstrated the ability to produce ara in our plants  however  our current manufacturing capacity would not permit us to produce ara quantities sufficient to meet current demand without impacting our production of dha 
to further improve our overall ara supply chain  we have directly engaged a us based provider of certain post fermentation ara manufacturing services 
along with our ara downstream processing capabilities at kingstree and winchester  this third party facility provides us with multiple us sites for the full downstream processing of ara 
when combining our current dha production capabilities in winchester and kingstree with dsm s current ara production capabilities in italy and the us  we have production capacity for dha and ara products in excess of million in annualized sales  collectively  to the infant formula and non infant formula markets 
as such  our production capabilities exceed current demand  however  we have the ability to manage production levels and  to a certain extent  control our manufacturing costs 
nonetheless  when experiencing excess capacity  we may be unable to produce the required quantities of oil cost effectively due to the existence of significant levels of fixed production costs at our plants and the plants of our suppliers 
the commercial success of our nutritional oils will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture these oils or have them manufactured at large scale on a routine basis and at a commercially acceptable cost 
our success will also be somewhat dependent on our ability to align our production with customer demand  which is inherently uncertain 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including gmp requirements 
under the terms of several of our infant formula licenses  those licensees may elect to manufacture these oils themselves 
we are currently unaware of any of our licensees producing our oils or preparing to produce our oils  and estimate that it would take a licensee a minimum of one year to implement a process for making our oils 
sources of supply our raw material suppliers for production of dha oil include major chemical companies and food and beverage ingredient suppliers 
we have identified and validated multiple sources for most of our major ingredients and do not anticipate that the lack of availability of raw materials will cause future production shortages 
research and development our research and development focus areas include i broadening the scientific evidence supporting the benefits of life sdha throughout life  ii improving manufacturing processes  and iii developing new products to expand our market offerings 
we perform research and development at our columbia  maryland  boulder  colorado and winchester  kentucky facilities 
our research and development expenditures in fiscal included  among other things  development activity directed toward i improving the quality  sensory properties and stability of our nutritional oils  ii developing new ingredient forms and applications technology for dha enriched food and beverage products  iii optimizing production characteristics of microalgal strains  iv investigating the clinical health benefits of dha and ara fatty acids  v exploring the biochemical pathways utilized by microalgae to produce dha  vi increasing our dha production yields  vii improving our ability to produce ara  viii reducing waste and continuing to improve the overall quality of our oils  ix developing feasible approaches to the expression of nutritional fatty acids  especially dha  in plant oilseeds  and x investigating the feasibility of utilizing our proprietary genes to produce other bioactive compounds with applications in the health and wellness fields 
we incurred total research and development expense of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing our nutritional oils are marketed and sold primarily to the infant formula  dietary supplement  pregnancy and nursing  animal feed and food and beverage industries 
generally  infant formula manufacturers are required to obtain a license from us in order to use our dha and ara oils in infant formula 
to date  we have entered into license agreements with over infant formula manufacturers  who collectively represent approximately of the world s retail infant formula market 
our licensees include infant formula market leaders mead johnson nutritionals  nestle  abbott laboratories  wyeth and danone formerly numico  each of whom is selling infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils 
due to the success of the supplemented infant formula products  several of our infant formula licensees are also selling extension products beyond infant formula  which contain our oils and are targeted to children ages nine months to seven years of age and older 
in addition  one of our infant formula licensees  mead johnson nutritionals  is selling a product containing life sdha targeted to pregnant and nursing women 
non infant formula customers including cvs pharmacy  walgreen s  everett laboratories  mission pharmacal are also selling products containing life sdha targeted to pregnant and nursing women 
life sdha is sold as an ingredient to supplement manufacturers and is also a branded supplement sold directly by martek 
neuromins is a martek supplement brand that is distributed and sold nationwide under license by several supplement manufacturers 
we are currently marketing food and beverage  supplement and animal feed applications to both us and international companies 
several of martek s customers such as dean foods  coca cola minute maid  general mills yoplait  jm smucker crisco  danone  starbuck s  parmalat australia and others have launched food and beverage products containing life sdha in the us and other countries 
generally  these products are also co branded with the life sdha logo 

table of contents we are continuing to aggressively pursue further penetration of our dha oils  both domestically and internationally  in the non infant formula markets 
we are in discussions with many companies to sell products containing our dha oils that are marketed for cognitive function  cardiovascular health and other applications 
to date  over domestic and international companies have launched non infant formula products that contain life sdha  most of which remain on the market and are believed to be meeting customer expectations 
we  along with our customers and certain third parties  are developing other dha delivery methods  including powders and emulsions  to facilitate further entry into the non infant formula markets 
management believes that over the next few years  the non infant formula markets will continue to expand and could ultimately represent a larger opportunity than infant formula 
consumer marketing efforts are performed primarily by our customers although we play a supportive role 
our infant formula licensees market their dha and ara supplemented formulas directly to consumers and healthcare professionals 
our dietary supplement and food and beverage customers also create and implement their own advertising campaigns 
we support these efforts through trade show participation and targeted direct mail campaigns as well as limited advertising and public relations campaigns 
our dha product is branded as life sdha and includes the tagline healthy brain  eyes  heart which is designed to be consumer friendly and to communicate the importance of dha for health throughout life 
our ara is branded as life sara 
the purpose of this branding initiative is to raise the awareness and understanding of the life sdha and life sara brands 
management believes that as consumers learn more about these trusted brands via martek s marketing and public relations efforts  they will be more likely to purchase products containing the life sdha and life sara logos 
this  in turn  provides support to martek s corporate partners by further accentuating the benefits of martek s products over other sources 
competition the healthcare and biological sciences industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
our competitors include major pharmaceutical  chemical  specialized biotechnology and food and beverage ingredient companies  many of whom have financial  technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours 
in addition  many specialized biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large  established companies to support research  development and commercialization of products and technologies that may be competitive with our products and technologies 
academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research and development activities that may be competitive with our products 
these organizations are seeking patent protection and may commercialize products and technologies on their own or through joint ventures that are competitive with our products and technologies 
the existence of products and technologies of which we are not aware  or those that may be developed in the future  may adversely affect the marketability of the products and technologies that we have developed 
fish oil based products currently dominate the adult dha supplement market and certain foods containing fish oils are on the market in various parts of the world 
dha containing fish oil for infant formula applications provides an alternative to our dha nutritional oil and is used by certain of our licensees and other infant formula manufacturers outside the united states 
in addition  in april  the fda notified abbott nutritionals then known as the ross products division of abbott laboratories that it had no questions at that time regarding ross conclusion that dha rich oil from tuna and ara rich oil from mortierella alpina are safe as sources of dha and ara in term and post discharge preterm infant formulas 
while abbott nutritionals has the regulatory permission to introduce fish oils into infant formula in the us  under the terms of the agreement executed by abbott with us in october  abbott has agreed to purchase its total needs for dha and ara from martek through at least furthermore  we are not aware of any plans by any of our other licensees to incorporate this alternative dha and ara blend into their infant formulas 
the gras notification  however  removes a significant regulatory hurdle to the introduction of competitive products in the us fish oil is generally less costly than our dha oil  and therefore presents a substantial competitive threat to our dha product line 
although fish oil is generally a lower cost product relative to our dha  it has odor  stability and taste characteristics as well as certain consumer perception issues that may limit its usefulness in food and beverage products 
several companies  including basf ag  dsm and ocean nutrition  and a number of other companies  manufacture microencapsulated fish oil products 
although microencapsulation of the oil resolves many of the odor  stability and taste issues found with fish oil  a microencapsulated product currently is more costly than regular fish oil 
because fish oil is generally less costly than our dha oil  even when microencapsulated  and continues to improve in quality and gain general market acceptance  fish oil presents a substantial competitive threat 
we continue to work to reduce the costs of our products and to improve the sensory and stability characteristics to make it easier for our customers to incorporate our products into their products 
we have also continued to refine our manufacturing processes in order to produce high levels of dha and thereby reduce our dha unit costs 
these improvements and changes make our dha more cost competitive with certain microencapsulated fish oils  on a price per dha unit basis  but not on a total omega basis due to the presence of large quantities of epa and other non dha omega fatty acids in fish oil 
published reports have cited certain fish oils as containing chemical toxins not present in our oils 
in addition  we believe the combination of low epa fish oil with a microbial source of ara for use in infant formula would likely infringe upon our patent position in several countries 
glaxosmithkline is currently selling lovaza  a prescription dha epa ethyl ester for treatment of hyperlipidemia 
lovaza is a lipid regulating agent which includes both epa and dha from fish oil 
glaxosmithkline has filed an application with the fda for an indication that will expand the use of lovaza 
other pharmaceutical companies offering other applications using omega fatty acids may be expected 

table of contents we believe that our nutritional oils have the following advantages over fish oil and other currently available sources of dha and ara for use in infant formula  as food and beverage ingredients  or as dietary supplements our oils do not have the impurities that may limit the usefulness of dha derived from unencapsulated fish oil  our oils  in general  are easier to formulate in food and beverage products  our oils can be blended in a variety of mixtures in precise ratios for specific applications  whereas the composition of fish oils may vary  each of our oils used in infant formula is comprised of a fatty acid blend that does not contain certain other fatty acids in significant quantities such as eicosapentaenoic acid epa  which may not be appropriate for consumption by infants at high levels 
our oils do not contain substances found in certain fish and fish oils such as methylmercury  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  dioxins and other toxic contaminants  our oils have a higher oxidative stability and longer shelf life than certain fish oils and are  therefore  more amenable to the spray drying process required for powdered formula  our oils are not produced from animal sources and  therefore  should be more desirable for use in food and beverage products as the available market does not exclude consumers who require a vegetable sourced dha  unlike fish oil  our oils are produced from renewable  sustainable natural resources  unlike fish oil  our dha and ara enriched oils are in an easily digestible triglyceride form similar to that found in fish oils and breast milk  but different from the phospholipid form found in egg yolk lipids  and our oils can be produced in large quantities under controlled conditions satisfying strict regulatory scrutiny 
at this time  our oils are the only dha and ara oils used in infant formula in the us suntory limited  cargill inc  through a joint venture with a company in china  and other independent chinese manufacturers are producing and distributing a fungal source of ara 
in addition  we are aware that there may be manufacturers in china and india producing or attempting to produce an algal source of dha  but we are uncertain of the overall status and commercial potential of these development efforts 
other companies  several with greater financial resources than ours  are developing plant based dha or other plant based oils that may compete with us and other companies may be developing chemically synthesized dha 
small amounts of dha and ara can be derived from egg yolk lipids  but dha and ara of this type are not in the same molecular form as that predominantly found in breast milk ie  phospholipid vs 
triglyceride 
dha and ara derived from egg yolks are currently being added to some brands of infant formula marketed by royal numico and several smaller companies 
we believe that the processes to produce dha and ara from egg lipids are more costly than the processes that we use for producing dha and ara from microbial sources 
furthermore  the addition of dha and ara from egg yolks at levels equivalent to those found in human breast milk may result in dietary levels of lecithin and cholesterol in excess of those found in human breast milk 
in december  lonza group ltd  a swiss chemical and biotechnology group  acquired from nutrinova nutrition specialties food ingredients gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary of celanese corporation  nutrinova s business having as its product a dha rich microalgal oil 
since the acquisition  lonza has actively marketed its dha oil to the food  beverage and dietary supplement market in europe and china  and was actively marketing in the united states 
nutrinova and lonza are defendants in patent infringement actions involving our dha patents that we have brought in both the united states and germany 
one of nutrinova s customers is also a defendant in these actions in germany 
in october  the infringement action in the united states was tried  and a verdict favorable to martek was returned 
the jury found that the defendants infringed all the asserted claims of three martek patents and that these patents were valid 
it also found that the defendants willfully infringed one of these patents 
in october  the judge upheld the october jury verdict that the defendants infringed all of the asserted claims of us patent nos 
 and  and that these patents were not invalid 
the judge has granted a permanent injunction against the defendants with respect to those two patents 
the judge also upheld the jury verdict that the defendants had acted willfully in their infringement of us patent no 
 regarding the third patent involved in the case  us patent no 
 the judge reversed the jury verdict and found that the asserted claims of this patent were invalid 
martek s request to the judge to reconsider his ruling on the third patent was denied 
martek and the defendants have appealed aspects of the judge s final decision 
the two patents where the infringement was upheld  us patent nos 
 and  are scheduled to expire in july and august  respectively 
in connection with these patent lawsuits  the company has incurred and capitalized significant external legal costs 
as of october   the patents being defended had a net book value of approximately million  including capitalized legal costs  which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining period of approximately four years 
a hearing in the german case was held in september and the court issued its decision in october  ruling that martek s patent was infringed by the defendants 
these patents are scheduled to expire through the defendants have appealed  and the appeal is expected to be heard in early these lawsuits are further described in item legal proceedings of part i of this form k 
there may be other competitive sources of dha and ara of which we are not aware 
the fact that many of the companies mentioned above are larger  more experienced and better capitalized than martek raises the significant risk that these companies may be able to use their resources to develop less costly sources of dha and ara than our current technology permits 
our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel  develop effective proprietary products  implement production and marketing plans  obtain and maintain patent protection and secure adequate capital resources 

table of contents patents  licenses and proprietary technology we have received numerous patents protecting our nutritional products technology  including the fermentation methods of producing our dha and ara oils  as well as the blending and use of certain dha and or ara oils in infant formula 
in  we received a us patent covering certain blends of a microbial oil enriched with dha and a microbial oil enriched with ara  as well as the use of such blends in infant formulas 
in  we received a us patent covering a process for making an edible oil containing dha under certain specified conditions and the edible oil made by such process as well as a us patent covering an infant formula comprising an edible dha containing oil with certain specified characteristics 
in  we received two additional us patents covering our nutritional oils technology 
the first patent protects pharmaceutical compositions and dietary supplements comprising a single cell oil in concentrations of at least dha in a triglyceride form made using our method of producing dha oil 
the second patent clarifies that our patent coverage includes the blending  in infant formula and dietary supplements  of microbially derived ara oil with low epa fish oils 
fish oil is a potential competitive source of dha to martek s algal derived dha oil 
this patent makes it more difficult for low epa fish oils to be combined with microbial sources of ara oils in the us without violating our patents 
a us patent was granted in  which protects the production  use and sale of oils rich in ara or greater concentration 
in  a us patent was issued protecting our dha rich algal biomass 
dha rich algal biomass is the raw product of the dha fermentation process and represents an inexpensive source of dha that may potentially be a low cost product itself 
we also have been awarded a number of foreign patents covering various aspects of our nutritional oils  including european patents covering our dha and ara rich oils 
an anonymous party has filed three requests for reexamination with respect to two of martek s us blended oils patents and one us ara patent  as discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings of part i of this form k 
we also own patents and applications that cover certain algal fermentation processes  lipid extraction purification  genomic based approaches to lipid production  arachidonic acid production and use  animal feeding protocols  and food and beverage applications for lcpufas 
from to  eight us patents owned by us were issued covering the use of certain algae in the production of omega lcpufas eg dha s  and the use of such lcpufas in such products as human foods and beverages  animal feed  aquaculture and the resulting supplemented meat  seafood  milk and eggs 
two of these patents have now expired 
from to  twelve us patents were issued covering  among other things  the fermentation of microorganisms in low chloride fermentation medium and their use in aquaculture applications 
six of these patents have now expired 
additional patent applications covering this technology are still pending 
other us patents have been issued and a number of patents are pending worldwide 
lonza has filed requests for reexamination with respect to seven of martek s dha patents three of which have now expired  as discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings of part i of this form k 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
our policy is to aggressively protect our proprietary technology through patents  where appropriate  and in other cases  through trade secrets 
additionally  in certain cases  we rely on the licenses of patents and technology of third parties 
we hold approximately us patents  covering various aspects of our technology  which will expire on various dates between and our core infant formula related us patents expire between and martek has been granted us patents covering food and beverage products containing martek s dha oil which expire by  and granted us patents covering certain processes for producing dha containing oil that may be used in foods and beverages which expire between and in addition  martek has several pending patents related to dha  including products and processes  which could offer longer term protection but with uncertain commercial value at this time 
we have filed  and intend to file  applications for additional patents covering both our products and processes as appropriate 
currently  we have over issued patents and over pending patent applications worldwide 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications filed by  assigned to or licensed to us will be granted  we will develop additional products that are patentable  any patents issued to or licensed by us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for inventions  any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others  or issued patents  or patents that may be issued  will provide protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable 
furthermore  patent law relating to the scope of claims in the fields of healthcare and biosciences is still evolving  and our patent rights are subject to this uncertainty 
european  united states and asian patent authorities have not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed for health and bioscience patents 
our products might infringe the patent rights of others  whether existing now or in the future 
similarly  the products of others could infringe our patent rights 
the defense and prosecution of patent claims are both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor 
an adverse outcome in infringement actions by martek against third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by the affected martek patent rights 
an adverse outcome in infringement actions by third parties against martek could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties and or require us to cease selling the affected products 
it is our corporate policy to vigorously protect our substantial investment in the research and development of our products and to continue to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights against third parties who engage in the unauthorized manufacture  sale  or use of our technology 
we currently have several challenges to our european patents covering our dha and ara oils and these challenges  as well as our lawsuit against others for infringement of our patents  are described in item legal proceedings of part i of this form k 
total patent litigation expenditures were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of which approximately  million and million  respectively  related to our successful patent infringement litigation against lonza and nutrinova 

table of contents we expect that  in the future  as our nutritional oils continue to be commercialized  opposition to our intellectual property by our competitors will continue and most likely increase 
we believe that additional challenges to our suite of us patents may arise in the future 
we will likely incur substantial costs in the future protecting and defending our patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we fail to maintain patent protection for our nutritional oils or our patents expire  it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to gain a competitive advantage for these oils and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly future sales of our nutritional oils and future license fees related to sales of infant formula containing these oils 
in particular  a lack of patent protection would permit our competitors to manufacture products that would be directly competitive with our nutritional oils using similar or identical processes  and it is possible that our current infant formula or food and beverage licensees or those which may be under license in the future may choose ingredients from these competitors if they choose to include the ingredients at all 
furthermore  even if our licensees continue to use our oils  direct competition could force us to reduce the price of our products which could materially affect future revenues and product margins 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
government regulation and product testing our products and our manufacturing and research activities are subject to varying degrees of regulation by state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states  including the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act 
the products developed by us are subject to regulation by the fda as food and beverage ingredients  dietary supplements  drugs and or medical devices 
the regulatory status of any product is largely determined by its intended use 
drugs and medical devices generally may not be marketed without first obtaining fda authorization to do so 
new infant formulas also are subject to premarket notification requirements 
although there are no premarket authorization requirements for whole foods per se  there are premarket approval requirements for food and beverage additives 
specifically exempt from the food additive definition and  therefore  the premarket approval requirements  are generally recognized as safe food and beverage ingredients 
dietary supplements for the most part are not subject to premarket authorization requirements  although there is a premarket notification requirement for certain new dietary ingredients that were not marketed as dietary supplements prior to october the fda has established detailed gmp  labeling and other requirements for drugs  medical devices  infant formulas  foods and beverages and dietary supplements 
the requirements for drugs  medical devices  infant formulas and dietary supplements generally are much more stringent than the requirements for foods and beverages 
our infant formula licensees are responsible for obtaining the requisite regulatory clearances to market their products containing our oils 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that may vary widely from country to country 
in may  the fda completed a favorable review of our generally recognized as safe gras notification for the use of our dhasco and arasco oil blend in specified ratios in infant formulas 
since the first product introduction in february  supplemented infant formulas manufactured by six of our licensees  mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  pbm products  nestle  hain celestial and nutricia north america  have been sold in the united states 
the fda regulates the use and marketing of dietary supplements under the provisions of the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea 
we are currently selling several lines of dha dietary supplements 
in addition  we are researching and developing new applications for our dha and ara oils 
we believe that our dha and ara are not new dietary ingredients and  as such  are not subject to premarket notification requirements when marketed for use as dietary supplements 
there can be no assurance that the fda would agree that a premarket notification is not required or that we will be able to comply with the requirements of dshea or any regulations that the fda may promulgate thereunder 
in june  the australia new zealand food authority authorized the use of dha s oil for use as a novel food ingredient in australia and new zealand 
in june  the european commission authorized the use of our dha s oil as a novel food ingredient in certain foods in the european community 
this novel food designation authorizes the use of our dha s as an ingredient in certain foods such as certain dairy products  including cheese and yogurt but not milk based drinks  spreads and dressings  breakfast cereals  food supplements and dietary foods for special medical purposes in the european community 
in february  the fda completed a favorable review of our gras notification for the use of dha s in food and beverage applications 
in october  health canada approved per serving levels of martek s dha of not less than eight mg and not more than mg of dha when used as a food ingredient 
in june  we received approval for the use of our dha s oil in food and beverages in mexico 
in august  the ministry of health in china authorized the use of our life sdha as a novel food ingredient 
this designation permits the use of life sdha in foods  beverages and supplements in china for persons older than three years 
this initial approval by the ministry of health is part of the regulatory process applicable to chinese novel foods and requires renewal before august in order to be made permanent 
in december  however  china issued a new novel food regulation requiring that a new application be filed 
we are therefore preparing a new application for submission in order to obtain approval under this new regulation 
in march  the israeli ministry of health approved dha rich oil from schizochytrium patterned after the approval in europe 
in  the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan confirmed that dha algal oil is also regarded as a traditional food and as such is acceptable for use in foods and beverages and dietary supplements 
other products derived from microalgae and other organisms may be subject to potential regulation by the fda as either medical devices or as a combination medical device drug product to the extent that they are used in the diagnosis  mitigation  treatment  cure or prevention of diseases 
such classification would subject the products to premarket clearances and or regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurances that we or our licensees or collaborators would be able to develop the extensive safety and efficacy data needed to support such fda premarket authorizations or that the fda ultimately would authorize the marketing of such products on a timely basis  if at all 

table of contents for potential pharmaceutical uses of products derived from microalgae and other organisms  there can be no assurance that required clinical testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to our products 
additionally  there is no assurance that we or our licensees or collaborators will be able to develop the extensive data needed to establish the safety and efficacy of these products for approval for drug uses  or that such drug products will not be subject to regulation as biological products or as controlled substances  which would affect marketing and other requirements 
some of our products are in research or development phases 
we cannot predict all of the regulatory requirements or issues that may apply to or arise in connection with our products 
changes in existing laws  regulations or policies and the adoption of new laws  regulations or policies could prevent us or our licensees or collaborators from complying with such requirements 
due to the cost and time commitment associated with the fda regulatory process  we will decide on a product by product basis whether to handle relevant clearance and other requirements independently or to assign such responsibilities to our licensees or future collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that we or our licensees or collaborators will be able to obtain such regulatory clearances  if required  on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  such clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with the manufacture of certain of our products  we are required to adhere to applicable current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations as required by the fda 
gmp regulations specify production and process controls  component and product testing standards  quality control and quality assurance requirements  and records and other documentation controls 
the gmp requirements for foods and beverages  infant formulas  drugs and medical devices vary widely 
as a manufacturer of dha and ara that are marketed as dietary supplements and used as ingredients in infant formulas sold in the united states and in foods and beverages  we are subject to gmp and various other requirements applicable to such products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to manufacture our nutritional oils in accordance with relevant food and beverage  dietary supplement and infant formula requirements for commercial use 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies  including the fda and comparable agencies in other countries 
a determination that we are in violation of such gmp and other regulations could lead to an interruption of our production output and the imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls or product seizures  and  in the most egregious cases  criminal sanctions 
as large scale manufacturing facilities  our plants in winchester  kentucky and kingstree  south carolina are required to abide by applicable federal and state environmental and safety laws  including regulations established by the environmental protection agency us epa and the occupational safety and health administration osha and similar state agencies 
in addition  our solvent extraction processes include the use of hexane  which is extremely flammable and subject to emission requirements 
if we fail to abide by these laws we could receive fines  or if the violations were serious enough  our operations could be shut down or restricted until the problems are fixed 
such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our nutritional oils  and our financial results could be negatively impacted 
while the costs of our compliance with environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty  such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our earnings or financial or competitive position 
see item legal proceedings of part i of this form k for further discussion 
the federal trade commission ftc regulates certain aspects of the advertising and marketing of our products 
under the federal trade commission act  a company must be able to substantiate both the express and implied claims that are conveyed by an advertisement 
it is not uncommon for the ftc to conduct an investigation of the claims that are made about products in new and emerging areas of science that involve a potentially vulnerable population such as infants 
an adverse action by the ftc could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
employees as of october   we had full time employees  of whom have phds approximately employees are engaged in research and development activities  are engaged in production or production development related activities and are in administrative  business development and sales and marketing positions 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement
