item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail in part i  item under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this form k with the securities and exchange commission  and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of natural gas and liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since we conduct our operations in three geographical segments and five business units 
the geographical segments are the united states  canada  and international 
the business units are western  eastern  southern  canada  and international 
we conduct exploration and development activities in each of our geographical segments  however  substantially all of our estimated proved reserves and all of our producing properties are located in north america 
forest s total estimated proved reserves as of december  were approximately tcfe 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves were in the united states  approximately were in canada  and approximately were in italy 
acquisition of houston exploration on june   forest completed the acquisition of the houston exploration company houston exploration in a cash and stock transaction totaling approximately billion and the assumption of houston exploration s debt 
houston exploration was an independent natural gas and oil producer engaged in the exploration  development  exploitation  and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves in north america 
houston exploration had operations in four producing regions within the united states south texas  east texas  the arkoma basin of arkansas  and the uinta and dj basins in the rocky mountains 
the principal factors management considered in making the acquisition included the mix of complementary high quality assets in certain of our existing core areas  lower risk exploitation opportunities  expected increased cash flow from operations available for investing activities  and opportunities for cost savings through administrative and operational synergies 
at the time of the acquisition in june  forest estimated the houston exploration oil and gas reserves to be bcfe  of which were classified as proved developed and the remaining amounts were classified as proved undeveloped 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement and plan of merger merger agreement  forest paid total merger consideration of million in cash and issued approximately million common shares  valued at per share 
the per share value of the forest common shares issued was calculated as the average of forest s closing share price for a five day period surrounding the announcement date of the acquisition on january  the cash component of the merger consideration was financed from a private placement of million of senior notes due and borrowings under our billion second amended and restated credit facilities that were executed on june  immediately following the completion of the merger  forest repaid all of houston exploration s outstanding bank debt totaling million 
the revenues and expenses associated with houston exploration have been included in forest s consolidated statement of operations since june   the date the acquisition closed 
sale of alaska assets on august   forest sold all of its assets located in alaska the alaska assets to pacific energy resources ltd 
perl 
forest estimated the proved oil and gas reserves associated with the alaska assets at closing to be bcfe 
the total consideration received for the alaska assets included million in cash  million shares of perl common stock subject to certain restrictions  and a zero coupon senior subordinated note from perl due in the principal amount at stated maturity of million 
spin off of offshore gulf of mexico operations on march   forest completed the spin off of its offshore gulf of mexico operations by means of a special dividend  which consisted of a pro rata spin off the spin off of all outstanding shares of forest energy resources  inc hereinafter known as mariner energy resources  inc or meri  a total of approximately million shares of common stock  to holders of record of forest common stock as of the close of business on february  immediately following the spin off  meri was merged with a subsidiary of mariner energy  inc mariner the merger 
mariner s common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange on march  forest estimated the proved oil and gas reserves associated with the spin off to be bcfe 
the spin off was a tax free transaction for federal income tax purposes 
prior to the merger  as part of the spin off  meri paid forest approximately million 
the million was drawn on a newly created bank credit facility established by meri immediately prior to the spin off 
this credit facility and the associated liability were included in the spin off 
subsequent to the closing  in forest received additional net cash proceeds of million from meri for a total of million 
in accordance with the transaction agreements  forest and meri each submitted post closing adjustments  from which forest paid meri a total of million during additional adjustments to the cash amount may occur during pending the resolution of certain accounting matters that are the subject of ongoing arbitration between forest and meri 
the arbitration is currently expected to be concluded in the second half of other highlights forest s other highlights were as follows oil and gas production in increased to bcfe from bcfe in forest s year end estimated proved reserves were a record  bcfe  bcfe higher than s year end estimated proved reserves of  bcfe  primarily as a result of the houston exploration acquisition and additional discoveries offset by the sale of the alaska assets 
on june   forest issued million of senior notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the notes offering of million  after deducting initial purchaser discounts  were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for forest s acquisition of houston exploration 
on june   forest entered into second amended and restated us and canadian credit facilities in connection with the houston exploration acquisition which will mature in initial commitments consist of a us facility of million and a canadian facility of million for a total of billion 
outlook in  we expect to continue our development and exploitation activities on our north american assets for which we expect continued production growth 
our exploration and development expenditures budget for is million to billion 
most of this capital budget will be directed to our large drilling programs in the buffalo wallow field in the texas panhandle  the deep basin in alberta  canada  the rincon  charco  katy  and mcallen ranch fields in south texas  the cotton valley in east texas  and the arkoma basin in arkansas 
our inventory of exploitation and development projects is significant  which should provide us good visibility of future production growth 
additionally  together with our continued production cost reduction initiatives  the acquired lower cost natural gas producing assets from houston exploration  and the sale of higher cost oil producing alaska assets  we expect our future per unit production costs in to be lower than previous years 
however  with our production mix more heavily weighted towards natural gas production  our revenues will be more heavily dependent on natural gas prices than they have been in the past 
natural gas production is expected to make up approximately of our total production mix in compared to approximately in we expect to continue to pursue asset acquisition opportunities in  but expect to continue to confront intense competition for these assets 
also  due to a relatively high commodity price environment  we anticipate service costs as well as costs of equipment and raw materials to remain consistent with the levels experienced in our challenge will be to economically add reserves  through drilling and acquisitions  and operate our productive assets in a cost efficient manner that achieves attractive returns for our shareholders 
results of operations for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the increase in net earnings in compared to was primarily due to increases in earnings from operations and realized hedging gains  offset by increased unrealized mark to market hedging losses and interest expense 
for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share  an increase compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the increase in net earnings in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized mark to market hedging gains  offset by decreased earnings from operations as a result of the spin off transaction discussed above

production volumes and oil and gas revenues net oil and gas production in was bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day  a increase from bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day in the net increase in oil and gas production was primarily attributable to the additional production associated with the houston exploration acquisition in june  which was partially offset by the spin off in early march and the sale of the alaska assets in august oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects in were billion  a increase as compared to million in the increase in oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects of million was due to the increase in production  offset by a decrease in the average realized sales price before the effects of hedging  to per mcfe in from per mcfe in net oil and gas production in was bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day  a decrease from bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day in the net decrease in oil and gas production was primarily attributable to the spin off of our offshore gulf of mexico properties on march   partially offset by production increases in the buffalo wallow area and the canadian deep basin as well as the east texas property acquisition in march oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects were million in  a decrease as compared to billion in the decrease in oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects was due to the decrease in production as well as a decrease in the average realized sales price before the effects of hedging to per mcfe in from in hedge effects the table above also presents the effects of the derivative instruments eg  commodity swaps and collars we designated as cash flow hedges 
beginning in march  we elected to discontinue the use of cash flow hedge accounting for all of our commodity derivatives 
accordingly  all gains or losses recognized ie  cash settlements in connection with hedging activities for the majority of and all of are reflected in realized gains and losses on derivative instruments in other income and expense in our consolidated statements of operations rather than being included as part of revenues 
see realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments below for information on gains and losses recognized on derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges during the last three years 
oil and gas production expense the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas production expense for the years ended december    and year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data lease operating expenses loe direct operating expense and overhead    workover expense    hurricane repairs  total loe    loe per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe

total oil and gas production expense total oil and gas production expense per mcfe lease operating expenses lease operating expenses were million in  an increase of compared to million in on a per mcfe basis  loe decreased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in the decrease in loe on a per mcfe basis is primarily due to lower average per unit lease operating expenses from the assets acquired from houston exploration in june  the divestiture of the alaska assets in august  and continued cost reduction initiatives 
lease operating expenses decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease in lease operating expenses is primarily due to the spin off of our gulf of mexico operations on march   partially offset by increases in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of east texas properties in march on a per mcfe basis  loe increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in production and property taxes production and property taxes  which are primarily made up of severance taxes paid on the value of the oil and gas produced  generally fluctuate proportionately to our oil and gas revenues 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenue  excluding hedging losses recognized in and  production and property taxes were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in each period is primarily the result of a change in our production mix to a higher percentage of onshore production  which is generally subject to production taxes  versus offshore gulf of mexico production  which is generally not subject to production taxes 
in addition  normal fluctuations will occur between periods based on the approval of incentive tax credits  changes in tax rates  and changes in the assessed values of property and equipment for purposes of ad valorem taxes 
transportation and processing costs transportation and processing costs were million  or 
per mcfe  in compared to million  or 
per mcfe  in the decrease of 
on a per mcfe basis in was due primarily to lower per unit transportation costs incurred in alaska in compared to the prior year and due to the sale of the alaska assets in august transportation and processing costs were million  or 
per mcfe  in compared to million  or 
per mcfe  in the 
per mcfe increase was primarily due to higher transportation and processing costs in canada and due to lower average per unit transportation and processing costs associated with our offshore gulf of mexico operations  which were included in the spin off in march general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense incurred during the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data stock based compensation costs    other general and administrative costs    general and administrative costs capitalized   general and administrative expense    general and administrative expense per mcfe 


general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase in net general and administrative expense was primarily related to increased employee salary and benefit costs resulting from the acquisition of houston exploration  offset by a reduction to stock based compensation costs in the increase in general and administrative expense of million to million in from million in was primarily related to higher stock based compensation costs discussed below  offset by salary and benefit savings related to a reduction in the number of employees subsequent to the spin off 
the increase of 
on a per unit basis from to was also primarily due to stock based compensation costs 
the percentage of general and administrative costs capitalized remained relatively constant between the three years  ranging between and 
the increase in stock based compensation costs beginning in was due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the awards and is recognized over the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense was recognized for stock options issued to employees  because the grant price equaled or was above the market price on the date of the option grant 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  we recorded stock based compensation cost in the amount of million in and million in  of which approximately million was attributed to a partial settlement of forest s restricted stock awards and phantom stock unit awards in connection with the spin off 
the decrease in stock based compensation of million in from was due to the million partial settlement in  partially offset by the recognition of stock based compensation associated with restricted stock and stock options granted in depreciation and depletion  undeveloped properties year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe amounts depreciation and depletion expense    depreciation and depletion expense per mcfe depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense dd a in was million compared to million in on an equivalent mcf basis  dd a expense increased to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increase of 
per mcfe in was primarily due to the acquisition of the houston exploration properties  which had higher than historical per unit depletion rates 
dd a in was million compared to million in the following costs of undeveloped properties were not subject to depletion at the periods indicated december  united states canada international total in thousands the increase in the total undeveloped properties of million in from million in is primarily attributable to the houston exploration acquisition completed in the decrease in the total undeveloped properties of million in from million in was due primarily to the spin off transaction noted above  offset by property acquisitions completed during  including the cotton valley assets in east texas 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on acquisitions and divestitures 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion expense of million in  million in  and million in was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligations pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement obligation is required to be accreted each period to its present value 
the significant decrease from to is attributable to the large reduction in future abandonment liabilities associated with the spin off in march  discussed above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our asset retirement obligations 
international impairments forest recorded impairments related to its international properties of million in  with million recorded during the second quarter of related to a dry hole drilled in gabon and million recorded during the fourth quarter of related to expired concessions in italy 
in  forest recorded an impairment of million related to certain international properties  principally related to its leaseholds in romania 
the romania impairment was recorded in the first quarter of in connection with our decision to exit the country as we rationalized our international assets to concentrate on fewer areas 
gain on sale of assets during the year ended december   forest sold overriding royalty interests in australia for net proceeds of million that resulted in a gain on the sale of million 
interest expense interest expense of million in increased by million  or  from million in the increase in interest expense in from is primarily due to the senior notes due that we issued in june and the alaska term loan credit facilities  which were entered into in december and were paid off in august interest expense of million in was greater than in  primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances 
interest costs related to significant unproved properties that are under development are capitalized to oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
forest capitalized interest of million  million  and 
million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in interest capitalized in from is due to the acquisition of houston exploration  which included a large investment in unproved properties 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments the table below sets forth realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives recognized under other income and expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 
since march  when forest elected to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting for all of its derivative instruments  forest has recognized all mark to market gains and losses as unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations rather than deferring any such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
in addition  cash settlements on derivative instruments are recorded as realized gains and losses on derivative instruments in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations rather than as an adjustment to revenues or interest expense 
the amounts shown in the table below for and  prior to our discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting  represent amounts related to ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not meet the criteria to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting

results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary were sold to cinergy canada  inc cinergy for million cdn 
the subsidiary s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  cinergy will market natural gas on behalf of canadian forest for five years through february unless subject to prior contractual commitment  and will also administer the netback pool that we formerly administered 
we could receive additional contingent payments related to this sale over the next two years if cinergy meets certain earnings goals with respect to the acquired business 
during the years ended december  and  forest did not receive any additional contingent payments 
during  forest received an additional million contingent payment million net of tax under the agreement  which has been reflected as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources in  as in  we expect our cash flow from operations to be our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than large acquisitions 
any remaining cash flow from operations will be available for acquisitions  in whole or in part  or other corporate purposes  including the repayment of senior notes that will come due in june the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production have a significant impact on operating cash flows 
while significant price declines in would adversely affect the amount of cash flow generated from operations  we utilize a hedging program to partially mitigate that risk 
as of february   forest has hedged approximately bcfe of its production 
this level of hedging provides some certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a portion of our expected production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
for further information concerning our hedging contracts  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging program  below 
our revolving us and canadian bank credit facilities  which were amended and restated in june  provide another source of liquidity 
these credit facilities  which mature in june  are used to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions in the united states and canada as needed 
see bank credit facilities below for details 
the public capital markets have been our principal source of funds to finance large acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity securities in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
nevertheless  ready access to capital on reasonable terms can be impacted by our debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies and are subject to many uncertainties  including restrictions contained in our bank credit facilities and indentures for our senior notes  macroeconomic factors outside of our control  and other risks as explained in part  item a risk factors 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest  and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  and our short term contractual obligations at current levels for the foreseeable future 
bank credit facilities on june   forest entered into amended and restated credit facilities totaling billion 
the amended and restated facilities consist of an million us credit facility the us facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na and a million canadian credit facility the canadian facility  and together with the us facility  the credit facilities through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  toronto branch 
the credit facilities mature in june subject to the agreement of forest and the applicable lenders  the size of the credit facilities may be increased by million in the aggregate 
forest s availability under the credit facilities will be governed by a borrowing base global borrowing base which currently is set at billion  with billion allocated to the us credit facility and million allocated to the canadian credit facility 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders in their sole discretion taking into consideration the estimated value of forest s oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the global borrowing base is redetermined semi annually and the available borrowing amount could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
in addition  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers and acquisitions  and include financial covenants 
interest rates and collateral requirements under the credit facilities will vary based on forest s credit ratings and financial condition  as governed by certain financial tests 
under certain conditions  amounts outstanding under the credit facilities may be accelerated 
bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to forest or certain of its subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facilities 
subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases  other events of default under either of the credit facilities will result in acceleration of the indebtedness under the facilities at the option of the lenders 
such other events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of obligations under the credit facilities including financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  a failure of the liens securing the credit facilities  and an event of default under the canadian facility

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the credit facilities 
the credit facilities are collateralized by a portion of forest s assets 
we are required to mortgage  and grant a security interest in  of the present value of our consolidated proved oil and gas properties 
we also pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if forest s corporate credit ratings by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would not apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on our properties 
from time to time  forest and the syndication agents  documentation agents  global administrative agent  and the other lenders party to the credit facilities engage in other transactions  including securities offerings where such parties or their affiliates may serve as an underwriter or initial purchaser of forest s securities and  or serve as counterparties to forest s derivative agreements

credit ratings our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  moody s and s p have assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the ratings agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure  and our general financial condition and prospects

derivative liabilities represent the fair value of liabilities for oil and gas commodity and interest rate derivatives as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions  below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
consists of our net share of budgeted expenditures under authorizations for expenditure afe that were approved by us and our joint venture partners as of december  includes afes for which forest is the operator as well as those operated by others 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable  such as gas transportation commitments and derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
forest does not believe that any of these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
see part i  item business regulation for further information 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in our financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed each quarter on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations and the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment could cause forest to record a significant non cash loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced thereafter 
in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
an impairment of unproved property costs may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishment of drilling rights or other information 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis 
impairments are also assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
in general  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to the successful efforts method 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
oil and gas reserve estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to independent audit of reserves under part i  item business  and our proved reserves are estimates and depend on many assumptions 
any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could cause the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves  and our revenue  profitability  and cash flow  to be materially different from our estimate  under part i  item a risk factors  in this form k 
accounting for derivative instruments we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
under the provisions of sfas  we may or may not elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge against changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability a fair value hedge or against exposure to variability in expected future cash flows a cash flow hedge 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations due to the fact that changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
since march  we have elected not to use hedge accounting 
accordingly  after march  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments have been and will continue to be recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity  and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments at december  would decrease the net fair value of our commodity derivative instruments at december  by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized related to our commodity derivative instruments will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are generally determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which related temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets will reverse  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during relevant periods are reduced 
asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro under sfas no 
are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
hedging program in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis

costless collars forest also enters into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
as of december   we had entered into the following collars costless collars natural gas nymex hh bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per mmbtu fair value in thousands january february  march december  included in forest s outstanding natural gas costless collars at december  are natural gas costless collars assumed in the houston exploration acquisition with a fair value of million 
at december   these costless collars had weighted average hedged floor and ceiling prices per mmbtu of for bbtu per day for january february  and for bbtu per day for march december three way costless collars forest also enters into three way costless collars with third parties 
these instruments establish two floors and one ceiling 
upon settlement  if the index price is below the lowest floor  forest receives the difference between the two floors 
if the index price is between the two floors  forest receives the difference between the higher of the two floors and the index price 
if the index price is between the higher floor and the ceiling  forest does not receive or pay any amounts 
if the index price is above the ceiling  forest pays the excess over the ceiling price

in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations
