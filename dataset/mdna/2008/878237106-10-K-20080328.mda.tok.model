readers are referred to the cautionary statements and important factors discussed in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  for further information 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following competition narrow profit margins dependence on information systems acquisitions and dispositions exposure to natural disasters  war and terrorism dependence on independent shipping companies labor strikes risk of declines in inventory value product availability vendor terms and conditions loss of significant customers customer credit exposure need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates  exposure to foreign markets changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation changes in accounting rules volatility of common stock price overview tech data is a leading distributor of information technology it products  logistics management and other value added services 
we distribute microcomputer hardware and software products to value added resellers  corporate resellers  direct marketers and retailers 
our offering of value added customer services includes training and technical support  external financing options  configuration services  outbound telemarketing  marketing services and a suite of electronic commerce solutions 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas including north america and latin america and europe 
our strategy is to leverage our efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand and cost efficiencies for our suppliers and customers around the world 
the it distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our suppliers  including those terms related to rebates and other incentives and price protection 
we expect these competitive pricing pressures to continue in the foreseeable future  and therefore  we will continue to evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms 
table of contents and conditions and the general market environment 
we will continue to focus on not only disciplined pricing and purchasing practices  but also on realigning our customer and vendor portfolio to support a sustainable higher margin business that will help drive long term profitability throughout all of our operations 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  within our customer or vendor portfolio  we may experience moderated sales growth or sales declines 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
we believe our balance sheet at january  was one of the strongest in the industry  with a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total shareholders equity of 
in fiscal  we delivered solid and consistent performance in the americas  achieving an operating margin in excess of while at the same time continuing to invest in growth and productivity enhancement initiatives 
in europe  we are making measurable progress towards improving our profitability with improving sales coverage in many of our european regions 
we have executed our restructuring programs throughout europe  which are improving our operating performance going forward 
in fiscal  the vast majority of our european businesses delivered improved operating income and cash metrics in comparison with fiscal we continue to fall short of our operating targets in germany and in response  we have made significant changes to our german management structure 
the new team is taking aggressive action to improve our execution throughout our german operations 
these changes will take time to take effect 
while we still have opportunities and expectations for additional improvement  we believe that our current performance within the majority of the european countries is a positive indicator of the company s ability to improve our operating performance 
as discussed above  we believe our fiscal financial performance demonstrates our ability to execute as we delivered solid performance in the americas and achieved significant improvements in our operating performance in europe compared to fiscal during fiscal  we announced several initiatives designed to further enhance our long term profitability and return on invested capital in europe  including the following we ceased operations in the united arab emirates uae 
during fiscal  our results included a loss on disposal of this subsidiary of approximately million  representing a million foreign currency exchange loss on our investment in the subsidiary previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and million for severance costs and fixed asset write offs 
in addition  the uae incurred other operating losses of approximately million during fiscal  comprised primarily of inventory write downs and occupancy related expenses 
the uae s operating results during fiscal and were insignificant relative to our consolidated financial results 
we completed the sale our operations in israel at an amount approximating local currency net book value 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss on disposal of this subsidiary of approximately million  representing a million foreign currency exchange loss on our investment in the subsidiary previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and million for costs related to the sale 
in addition  israel had operating losses of million during fiscal israel s operating results during fiscal and were insignificant relative to our consolidated financial statements 
we completed the exit from our logistics center in germany the moers logistics center during the second quarter of fiscal  which we believe will enable us to capitalize on the long term synergies of having one logistics center serving germany  austria and the czech republic 
related to the moers logistics center exit  we are expanding our logistics center located in bor  czech republic 
we expect the net result of these transactions to be a reduction in our future operating expenses 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges related to the closure of the moers logistics center  comprised of million of workforce reductions and million for facility costs and other fixed asset write offs 
we executed a joint venture agreement with brightstar corporation  one of the world s largest wireless distributor and supply chain solutions providers 
the joint venture will distribute mobile phones and other wireless devices to a variety of customers including mobile operators  dealers  agents  retailers and e tailers throughout the european market 
each of the joint venture partners has a ownership in the entity 
throughout fiscal  we executed vendor agreements with motorola  samsung  nokia and lg in selected regions around europe 
the joint venture commenced sales during the third quarter of fiscal and the operating results of the joint venture did not have a material impact on the fiscal results of operations 
we completed the acquisition of certain assets and the customer base of actebis switzerland ag in the third quarter of fiscal  for a purchase price of approximately million 
while not significant to our worldwide operations  we believe this acquisition will strengthen and further diversify our position in switzerland and will provide our existing and new customers with a broader portfolio of vendors and improved sales coverage and support 

table of contents in early march  we announced the execution of an agreement for the acquisition of certain assets of scribona  ab  a publicly traded it distribution company in the nordic region of europe  with operations in sweden  finland and norway scribona 
the purchase price for the assets is the net asset value plus a premium for the transferred assets  including inventory  intellectual property  material contracts  office equipment and certain other assets 
the premium is estimated to be in the range of million to million euros approximately to million 
the transaction is subject to various contingencies including labor consultations  clearance from the european union and scribona shareholder approval with a targeted completion in the second quarter of fiscal we have seen stronger recent performance in virtually all markets in europe  with the exception of germany 
we believe our strategy focused on execution  diversification and innovation will provide further improvements to our financial results 
however  the competitive environment and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to improve our operating margins  both in europe and the americas 
we will continue to work to selectively grow our net sales  profitability and market share 
we will also continue to make targeted investments across our worldwide operations in it enhancements  sales programs and new business units 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to those policies discussed below  it is important to note that effective february   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated our results of operations for the prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for fiscal includes compensation expense for stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and for stock based compensation awards granted after january  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
during fiscal and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
see further discussion related to our adoption of sfas no 
r included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any and our historical loss experience 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
conversely  if actual customer performance were to improve to an extent not expected by us  a reduction in allowances may be required which could have a favorable effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
vendor incentives earned for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded as adjustments to selling  general and administrative expenses  and any amounts earned in excess of the related cost is recorded in the same manner as unrestricted volume rebates  as discussed above 
we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be deemed uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  estimating the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

results of operations we do not consider stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no

products purchased from hewlett packard generated of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
there were no other manufacturers or publishers that accounted for or more of our net sales in the past three years 

table of contents the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for each of the three most recent fiscal years net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment loss on disposal of subsidiaries restructuring charges operating income loss other expense income interest expense discount on sale of accounts receivable interest income net foreign currency exchange gain loss income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before minority interest minority interest in net loss of joint venture income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss net sales our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by over fiscal and increased by in europe a decrease of on a euro basis 
our fiscal sales performance in the americas is primarily the result of stronger execution and increased sales and product management resources compared to the same period of the prior year 
these actions delivered strong growth across the americas  most notably in the direct marketer and small and medium sized business space 
we are generally pleased with our sales performance in europe and we believe it is a reflection of our improved stability and stronger execution in the majority of our european operations 
the year over year sales decline in euros can largely be attributed to our conscious efforts to remix our customer portfolio across europe to those markets providing more acceptable operating margins and or requiring less working capital to serve 
these efforts are consistent with our focus on increasing our overall return on capital employed in the european region 
declining average selling prices for the majority of the products we sell continued to have an offsetting impact on our sales growth results within both the americas and europe 
our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by over fiscal and increased by in europe an increase of on a euro basis 
our sales performance in the americas is primarily due to stronger sales to direct marketers and retailers compared to the prior year somewhat offset by declining average selling prices of many of the products we sell 
the increase in european sales in fiscal is primarily the result of the improved it demand experienced in the second semester of fiscal and improved stability in our european operations partially offset by much lower demand in western europe during the first semester of fiscal particularly in the second quarter 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  a basis point increase from in fiscal the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to continued improvements in our inventory and pricing management practices in europe as well as continued changes in the customer and product mix worldwide  partially offset by the competitive pricing conditions in the americas 
gross margin during fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the more challenging pricing environment in europe  particularly in the second quarter of fiscal and the internal distractions of management related to the final phases of our comprehensive it systems upgrade and harmonization project and the implementation of the restructuring program in europe  as discussed above 
since the completion of these initiatives during the third quarter of fiscal  we saw our european operations begin to stabilize and gross margins in the region improve sequentially during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 
table of contents we continue to remain cautiously optimistic as the competitive environment and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or continue to improve gross margin from its current level 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is primarily the result of improvements in credit performance  productivity improvements and the leveraging of our fixed costs in europe  offset by strategic investments made in personnel and information systems to support our long term growth and productivity initiatives 
in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year increase in sg a is primarily attributable to the stronger euro versus the us dollar  an increase in labor costs to support our longer term growth initiatives  start up and other operating expenses related to the brightstar joint venture which is consolidated for financial statement reporting purposes and an additional million of stock compensation expense related to sfas no 
r 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in credit costs  as discussed above  and cost decreases of million of external consulting costs related to the european restructuring program incurred during fiscal that did not recur in fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is the result of improvements in productivity  particularly in europe  where we began to realize the benefits associated with our restructuring efforts 
in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in credit costs in both the americas and europe due to higher than anticipated bankruptcies and other credit losses  increased labor costs in the americas  a stronger euro versus the us dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal  and an additional million of compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal these increases were offset in part by the productivity improvements and benefits realized in europe from the restructuring program  which we completed during the third fiscal quarter of sg a includes external consulting costs related to the european restructuring program of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
goodwill impairment in fiscal  due to certain indicators of impairment within our european reporting unit  the company performed an impairment test for goodwill as of july  this testing included the determination of the european reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
the company s reduced earnings and cash flow forecast for our european region resulted in the company determining that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
as of july   the company recorded a million non cash charge for the goodwill impairment in europe 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
as further discussed below  these restructuring charges include the charges related to the closure of the german logistics center  announced in the second quarter of fiscal  and charges related to the european restructuring program completed in october closure of european logistics center on may   our board of directors approved the exit from our logistics center in germany the moers logistics center 
the decision to exit this logistics center was made to enable the company to capitalize on the long term synergies of having one logistics center serving germany  austria and the czech republic and to reduce the company s expenses 
in connection with the moers logistics center exit  tech data is expanding its logistics center located in bor  czech republic 
the company expects the net result of these transactions to be a reduction in our future operating expenses 
during the year ended january   the company completed its exit of the moers logistics facility and recorded million in restructuring charges related to the closure  comprised of million of workforce reductions and million for facility costs and other fixed asset write offs 

table of contents european restructuring program as discussed earlier in this md a  in may  we announced a formal restructuring program to better align the european operating cost structure with the business environment prevailing at the time 
as of october   the initiatives related to the european restructuring program had been completed 
during fiscal  we recorded credits of million related to changes in estimates of previously recorded restructuring accruals  comprised of a million credit for facility costs and a million credit for workforce reductions 
during fiscal  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
in total  from inception through completion of the program  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries we incurred losses on the disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal for charges related to both the closure of our uae operations and the sale of our israel operations 
the million loss includes million of losses related to the closure of our uae operations and a million loss related to the sale of our israel operations 
the loss related to the closure of our uae operations includes a million impairment on our investment in the uae due to a foreign currency exchange loss previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income and million in severance costs and certain asset write offs related to the exit 
the million loss related to the sale of our israel operations includes a million impairment on our investment in israel due to a foreign currency exchange loss previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income and million in selling costs see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  discount on sale of accounts receivable  interest income  foreign currency exchange gains losses interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  we issued million of convertible senior debentures in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which bear interest at 
second  we improved our daily management of our cash conversion cycle  which resulted in lower average outstanding debt balances 
the interest expense reduction resulting from these two factors was partially offset by higher interest rates on revolving credit loans during fiscal compared to the prior year 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to the repurchase of the million convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of fiscal using revolving credit facilities  which have higher short term borrowing rates 
in addition  average short term interest rates increased in comparison to the prior fiscal year  resulting in an increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal discount on the sale of accounts receivable totaled million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the discount is associated with the accounts receivable purchase facility agreements executed in fiscal see further discussion below in this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the discount on sale of accounts receivables in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in the average period outstanding of the accounts receivables sold during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the discount on sale of accounts receivable from fiscal to fiscal reflects the fact that the company began selling accounts receivable under the program in the second quarter of fiscal which resulted in an increase in the average amount of accounts receivables sold under the programs and an increase in the discount rates charged in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal is primarily attributable to higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments compared to the prior year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments and higher average investment balances compared to the prior fiscal year 
we realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal and a net foreign currency exchange loss of million during fiscal we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  versus other currencies 
it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
our hedging policy prohibits speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 

table of contents minority interest in net loss of joint venture minority interest was million in fiscal and reflects the loss of our european joint venture attributable to brightstar corporation s ownership share in the joint venture 
the minority interest represents brightstar corporation s share of the joint venture losses  which is comprised primarily of start up costs  as the joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements 
the joint venture commenced sales in the third quarter of fiscal  but sales to date have not been significant 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the fiscal goodwill impairment in europe of million  which is non deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized 
the change in the effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was also impacted by the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance for brazil in the fourth quarter of fiscal the reversal of the million valuation allowance was recorded as an income tax benefit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain jurisdictions in europe of million related to net operating losses recorded in previous years 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily the result of increased income within both the americas and europe in fiscal compared to fiscal  offset by the million reversal of the brazilian valuation allowance on deferred tax assets discussed above and the effect of the million increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain jurisdictions in fiscal our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the previously discussed goodwill impairment in europe of million  which is non deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized 
additionally  we recorded an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain jurisdictions in europe of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  related to net operating losses recorded in previous years 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
while we believe our restructuring efforts are improving the operating performance within the european operations  we determined the respective increases in the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in fiscal to be appropriate due to cumulative losses realized or expected to be realized within the respective fiscal year  after considering the effect of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
to the extent we generate future consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring the valuation allowance  the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets will be reduced  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during these periods due to the relative mix of earnings or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate around the world such as a losses in tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit  b earnings in tax jurisdictions where we have previously recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  and c earnings in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us the overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in these operating jurisdictions 
we monitor the assumptions used in estimating the annual effective tax rate and adjust these estimates accordingly 
if actual results differ from these estimates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower earnings than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates  changes in the relative mix of taxable income and taxable loss jurisdictions  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 

table of contents discontinued operations  net of tax the results of operations and the gain on sale of the training business have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  within the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
in fiscal  we realized income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million  comprised of a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of the training business and million of income from operations of the training business prior to the sale in march we realized million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in fiscal impact of inflation during the fiscal years ended january   and  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our consolidated operations or on our financial position 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter and decreased demand in other fiscal quarters  particularly quarters which include summer months 
given that a significant portion of our revenues are derived from europe  the worldwide results closely follow the seasonality trends in europe 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and dispositions  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which includes both continuing and discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to affect the company s future liquidity 
the following table summarizes tech data s consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   and years ended january  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million of cash used in operations in fiscal the million cash provided by operations in fiscal was due primarily to our earnings and the timing of both cash receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors 
we continue to focus on working capital management by monitoring several key metrics  including our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days and owned inventory levels  that we use to manage our working capital 
our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
owned inventory is calculated as the difference between our inventory and accounts payable balances divided into the inventory balance 
our net cash days improved to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by our vendor partners was a negative at the end fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by 
this compares to negative owned inventory of at the end fiscal 
table of contents the following table presents the components of tech data s cash conversion cycle  in days  as of january   and as of january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle days net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily the result of our purchase of certain assets from actebis switzerland ag for million and capital expenditures of million for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of our israel operations 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal for equipment and machinery in our logistics centers  office facilities and it systems 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily due to million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  offset by million proceeds received from the sale of the training business and million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment

we pay interest rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
additionally  we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  amended in march  which expires in march we pay interest rate of at january  under this facility at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings

the total capacity of the aforementioned credit facilities was approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit agreements contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit agreements require compliance with certain warranties and covenants 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit agreements include a debt to capitalization ratio  an interest to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  deprecation and amortization ratio  and a tangible net worth requirement 
at january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year 
we pay interest on the debentures on june and december of each year  beginning on june  in addition  beginning with the period commencing on december  and ending on june  and for each six month period thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for the applicable interest period  if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels

holders have the right to convert the debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation and shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures in cash on any of the fifth  tenth or fifteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash at our option at any time on or after december  additionally  the debentures are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the proceeds from the offering were used to payoff short term debt and for other general corporate purposes 
in september  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
as of january   the share repurchase program authorized in september was complete 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares comprised of  shares purchased in connection with the our share repurchase program and shares purchased outside of the stock repurchase program  at an average of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million 
in fiscal  our board of directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock

shares we repurchase are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under employee equity incentive plans 
our debt to capital ratio was at january  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
contractual obligations as of january   future payments of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows in thousands operating leases capital leases long term debt total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments 
table of contents fair value renewal and purchase options and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
at january   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions under fin we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our fin liability of million has not been included in the contractual obligations table above see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility we have a synthetic lease facility with a group of financial institutions under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
the synthetic lease expires in fiscal and we intend to renew the lease for an additional five years 
at any time during the lease term  we may  at our option purchase up to four of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each property s cost 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each of the properties  in an aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
we pay interest on the synthetic lease at libor plus an agreed upon margin 
the synthetic lease contains covenants that must be complied with  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities discussed above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount funded under the synthetic lease approximately million at january  is treated as debt under the definition of the covenants required under both the synthetic lease and the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
in january  we sold approximately acres of excess land located in miami  florida 
the sale was executed pursuant to the excess sale provisions of the synthetic lease agreement and resulted in a gain of million recorded during the quarter ended january  this gain is included within sg a our consolidated statement of operations 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the synthetic lease at january  was approximately million 
properties leased under the synthetic lease facility are located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the synthetic lease has been accounted for as an operating lease 
fasb interpretation fin no 
requires us to evaluate whether an entity with which we are involved meets the criteria of a variable interest entity vie and  if so  whether we are required to consolidate that entity 
we have determined that the third party lessor of this synthetic lease facility does not meet the criteria of a vie and  therefore  is not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
trade receivables purchase facility agreements we have uncommitted revolving trade receivables purchase facility agreements the receivables facilities with third party financial institutions to sell accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
we use the receivables facilities as a source of working capital funding 
the receivables facilities limit the amount of purchased accounts receivable the financial institutions may hold to million at january   based on currency exchange rates at that date 
under the receivables facilities  we may sell certain accounts receivable the receivables in exchange for cash less a discount based on libor plus a margin 
such transactions have been accounted for as a true sale  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the receivables facilities  which have various expiration dates  require that we continue to service  administer and collect the sold accounts receivable 
during fiscal  and  we received gross proceeds of billion  billion and million  respectively  from the sale of the receivables and recognized related discounts totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the proceeds  net of the discount incurred  are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in operating activities within cash received from customers and the change in accounts receivable 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  the company did not utilize the receivables facilities as a source of funding 

table of contents guarantees as is customary in the it industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to both of the above guarantees is remote 
additionally  in connection with the sale of the training business discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we continue to negotiate the assignment of several of the related facility lease obligations with the lessors of such properties 
to the extent the lessors are unwilling to agree to a direct lease arrangement with the purchaser  we will remain liable in the event of default by the purchaser of the training business 
the majority of these lease obligations expire at various dates over the next four years and would require that we make all required payments under the lease agreements in the event of default by the purchaser 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under the guarantees is approximately million as of january  we believe that the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to these guarantees is remote 
we also provide residual value guarantees related to our synthetic lease which have been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual value guarantees 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary foreign currency exposure relates to transactions in europe  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
during fiscal and  the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  norwegian krone  polish zloty  swedish krona and swiss franc 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes and is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge both intercompany and third party a loans  b accounts receivable and c accounts payable 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and to finance working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion 
interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
we utilize various financing instruments  such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities  convertible senior debentures and trade receivable purchase facilities  to finance working capital needs 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate  random market price paths 
the var model determines the potential impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates assuming a one day holding period  normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign exchange and debt portfolio due to adverse movements in the rates 
the model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
firm commitments  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 

table of contents prior to january   the company presented market risk exposures using a tabular format 
in an effort to provide more meaningful information as to the company s exposure to future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company has made the change to present market risk exposures using the var model 
the following table represents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model at january  and we believe that the hypothetical loss in fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives would be offset by the gains in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
var as of january  january  in thousands currency rate sensitive financial instruments interest rate sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio actual future gains and losses associated with the company s derivative positions may differ materially from the analyses performed as of january  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
