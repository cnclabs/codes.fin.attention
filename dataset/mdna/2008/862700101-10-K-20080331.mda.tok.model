overview the company is a leading provider of antibody products and analytical test kits for a broad range of food  water  agricultural  industrial  environmental and scientific applications 
the company believes that its competitive position has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the business development activities it has pursued since its inception 
the company has achieved meaningful economies of scale for the products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits and antibodies and its facilities located in windham  maine and dallas  texas for the manufacture of antibodies 
the company believes that by applying its core competency of creating custom antibodies to assay development  it produces unique  sophisticated diagnostic testing and reagent systems that are responsive to customer diagnostic and information needs 
customers benefit with quantifiable return on investment by reducing time  labor and or material costs associated with applications for which the company s products are used 
in addition  the company believes its tests provide high levels of accuracy  reliability and actionability of essential test results as compared to alternative products 
the company is focused on sustaining this competitive advantage by leveraging its expertise in immunology  proteomics  bio luminescence and other bio reactive technologies to continue its successful customer focused research and development efforts 
the company believes that an established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
in  the company continued the transition from a fragmented product offering and marketing strategy to becoming a focused organization  with proven  proprietary technologies tied directly to its customers needs 
the transition is most evident in the genomic antibody technology gat initiative and food pathogen detection products  where significant progress is being made 
the company continues to develop and introduce new methods for the detection of food pathogens that deliver a strong competitive advantage to its customers 
in  the company filed a patent for new technology to be used in proprietary enrichments of its food pathogen testing methods 
the patent covers technology for increasing the specificity and sensitivity of the company s immunoassay test methods 
the patent also makes claims for the application of the technology in large scale bio production bio fermentation processes  such as those used in the production of amino acids  ethanol  enzymes and other processes using microbiological production methods 
the company continued to develop multiple channels to market worldwide through an approach that includes direct sales  inside sales  distributors and agents 
the company increased distribution for its food pathogen products in europe and asia where there is growing demand for the company s product line 
the company believes it is making progress in most of its business efforts 
as the deployment of new initiatives is accelerated  building on the company s leadership position in food pathogens and expanding its unique positioning in the emerging area of genomic antibodies  the company anticipates that the revenue lost to market changes in its legacy businesses will be replaced and the company will develop a stronger  more predictable  revenue base 
the company expects the genomic antibody technology and food pathogen products to be its primary growth drivers in the future  and that the company s competencies and the competitive positions these two areas provide are the strongest in the company s history 
corporate and growth initiatives the following provides an update on the business development activities related to the genomic antibody technology initiative and the new salmonella product in the food pathogen area  which utilizes a patent pending enrichment media technology 
genomic antibody technology the company announced an initiative to develop technology for the high throughput production of genetic antibodies early in  and in january  opened a new facility for molecular biology and hired two scientists who had been leading the development of this technology 
in january  the company announced the commercial introduction of the lead product  mouse polyclonal antibodies 
in may  the company launched gat in rabbits and in january  announced it had surpassed one million dollars in project bookings 
in october  the company announced the launch of a new internet based catalog of antibody reagents in support of oncology based research and discovery 
these high quality reagents are manufactured utilizing the company s genomic antibody technology and will carry the seqer brand 
the antibody product group is strategically important to the growth of the company  and to transforming the company into a biotech company with much greater opportunities to access the human health market with proteomic tools and solutions 
in november  the company completed a million expansion in its windham  maine facility to support its growth initiatives and increased polyclonal antibody production capacity by 
additionally  the company also announced the expansion of its molecular biology lab in dallas  texas and its facility in newark  delaware in response to growth in demand for both gat and conventional hybridoma development 
food safety the company s test for the detection of salmonella  launched commercially in august  has experienced increasing acceptance in the marketplace 
the success of this product has played a substantial role in driving the company s three consecutive quarters of more than year over year growth  which began with the second quarter of one of the technologies that made the new salmonella product possible is the subject of a patent filed by the company during the fourth quarter of the patent claims the use of bacteria phage for the growth and detection of a target bacterium in an environment that is contaminated by competing and cross reacting bacteria 
this new technology solves the problem of singling out the harmful pathogen among many other bacteria by creating an optimized environment for rapid growth of the targeted pathogen while dramatically suppressing other competing bacteria or bacteria that can interfere with the fidelity of the test method 
this technology is also being utilized by the company in the development of an e 
coli select product line 
in july  the company announced the expansion of its product line to include hygiene monitoring  with the exclusive distribution rights to kikkoman s lumitester pd n lucipac system from kikkoman in the us marketplace 
this unique  patented platform with a proprietary enzymatic recycling technology enables detection of residual biofilm and will allow the company to address the growing hygiene market in food protection  food service  quick service restaurants and personal and health care 
other initiatives industrial bio processing the company believes that the same technology used in its salmonella product has application in other bio processing environments including industrial bio processing 
there are many large scale industrial processes in which a manufacturer is attempting to manage the yield of a production organism in an environment contaminated by a competing bacteria 
these processes include applications such as ethanol and amino acid production  bio plastics and others 
the company claims such application in its patent 
in  the company announced an agreement to develop a commercial application in this technology with the poet company formerly called broin  a us based producer of ethanol 
this agreement was discontinued by poet in the fourth quarter of the company has hired energetix llc as its consultant and is actively pursuing technology scale up and demonstration in fully commercial ethanol plants as early as the third quarter of the company has a robust new product pipeline with technologies that the company believes will provide sustainable differentiation to address larger markets 
sales and marketing professionals are being hired in anticipation of new product launches and the opportunities identified 
the company continues to be focused on key customers and prospects in target markets food  pharma  in vitro diagnostics and biotech 
continuously improving the efficiency of the company s manufacturing and supply chain processes and improving the overall quality of products and services remains critical to the company s success 
economic and industry wide factors as industry continues to look for ways to reduce costs  the company believes there will be a continual shift from testing that requires highly trained personnel  expensive equipment and lengthy turnaround times for test results  to more rapid  accurate and cost effective testing which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in much shorter periods 
the global market for food pathogen testing continues to increase due to the globalization of the food supply  the establishment of harmonized quality standards  the consumer s desire for fresher  more ready to eat foods and foods from diverse geographies  and increasing regulatory and media scrutiny 
currently  the research tools portion of the biomarker and drug target discovery market is estimated by business communication company to be between million and billion dollars annually  and is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of more than over the next years to exceed billion dollars

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet the company s obligations and commitments  or obtain appropriate financing 
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for and  respectively  was primarily the result of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the periods ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
see non gaap financial measures below 
net cash used in investing activities for of million compares to net cash used in investing activities of million for these cash outflows were primarily the result of capital purchases which totaled million in versus million in the capital expenditures in were primarily related to the company s expansion in maine 
the capital expenditures in were related to purchases of manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for was primarily a result of additional debt incurred to fund the expansion in the maine facility 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting mostly of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the company s working capital current assets less current liabilities increased approximately million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the increase of million in cash and cash equivalents generated during outstanding debt increased to million at december  from  at december  due to additional financing of million for the expansion of the maine facility  offset by  of scheduled debt payments 
on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank  which was amended on august  this agreement provides for up to a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding and all of which was available at december  the revolving line of credit bears a variable interest rate of between basis points and basis points over the one month libor rate depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda 
the current rate of interest on this available line of credit  taking into account the variable interest rate and libor  was approximately at december  on december   the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provided for up to million in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a variable interest rate of between basis points and basis points over the one month libor rate depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda  as defined 
payments are due monthly  with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
the company s current rate of interest on this loan  taking into account the variable interest rate and libor  was approximately at december  on august   the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provided for up to million in financing  million of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over five years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a fixed interest rate of 
payments are due monthly with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
under the terms of the above financings  the company is required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants that include a ratio of ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and cash paid for taxes greater than and a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed 
the company met all of its financial covenants with respect to this indebtedness at december  and expects that it will be able to meet all of its financial covenants with respect to this indebtedness for at least the next months 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from the net cash provided by operating activities  cash available and on hand and from the financing agreements described above 
at december   the company had million in debt and stockholders equity of million 
although the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   it does anticipate that it may spend approximately million in to upgrade or expand certain manufacturing  research and development and office systems 
based upon its cash on hand  credit facilities  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements at least through the next months 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company successfully locating and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the long term liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
non gaap financial measures the company presents an ebitda measure as the company believes this provides investors and the company s management with additional information to measure the company s liquidity 
ebitda measures are not a measure of performance under gaap  and therefore  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations 
additionally  the company s ebitda calculations may differ from the ebitda calculations for other companies 
the calculation of the company s ebitda measure as discussed above  and the reconciliation of the company s ebitda measure to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and  respectively  is as follows amounts in thousands twelve months ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities changes in assets and liabilities receivables inventories other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued expenses deferred revenue other non current liabilities net change in deferred income tax income tax provision loss on disposal of fixed assets stock compensation expense interest income  net ebitda off balance sheet arrangements as of december  the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the company is committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts our long term indebtedness and leases 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations 
below is a schedule of the future payments that the company was obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due by year and beyond total in thousands long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables are in dispute with the customer or otherwise deemed uncollectible  the corresponding amounts are written off and are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for inventories that consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
for inventories that consist of costs associated with the production of custom antibodies  cost is determined using the specific identification method 
realization of such inventories is dependent upon the successful completion of a project in accordance with customer specifications 
losses on projects in progress are recorded in the period such losses become likely and estimable 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  at december   management concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary for federal deferred tax assets after considering the positive and negative evidence 
in making this determination  the company considered the following positive factors us income before taxes of million  and  for each of the three years ending december   and respectively  operating margins of in  in and in  past and anticipated new product launches  use of annual election to capitalize research and experimentation expenses under internal revenue code section e  which will then be amortized over a ten year period  and the expansion of the company s capacity for rabbit antibodies  with completion of a new rabbit barn in the company also considered the following negative factors uncertainty of the us economy heading into  and federal net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance of approximately  is necessary for deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions 
for the state jurisdictions  management has considered the same positive and negative evidence as utilized for the federal deferred tax assets described above 
the company has also considered the substantial reduction of its presence in north carolina and pennsylvania since the time when the net operating losses were incurred in those jurisdictions as additional negative evidence 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to operations in the united kingdom uk 
management considered positive and negative indicators in concluding that a substantial valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary for the foreign deferred tax assets of million 
the positive indicators included the contribution to income before taxes by the operations in the uk for and  and the expected income before taxes in the uk for the negative indicators included a history of substantial net operating losses in the uk  the lack of income before taxes until and limitations with regard to estimating income in the uk beyond resulting from concerns about the future need for a foreign subsidiary 
the net operating loss carryforwards differ from the accumulated deficit  principally due to differences in the timing of recognition of certain research and development expenses  depreciation and amortization  other non deductible reserves and limitations under federal and state tax regulations for acquired net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards  including those acquired  of approximately million  which begin to expire as follows year nol in thousands total based on the best information available to the company today  the company expects to have sufficient future taxable income to utilize such nols prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carry forwards 
revenue recognition revenues composed of sales of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
revenues associated with such products or services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an order exists  shipment of product has occurred or services have been provided  the price is fixed or determinable and  collectibility is probable 
management is required to make judgments based on actual experience about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company enters into contracts related to the production of custom antibodies  which provide for the performance of defined tasks for a fixed price  with delivery of the product upon completion of production 
the standard time to complete a project is typically longer than days but less than months and effort is expended over the life of the project 
revenues related to sales of custom antibody projects are recognized when a project s specifications have been met and or the related materials have been shipped 
fees associated with products and services added on to a custom antibody project subsequent to delivery of the initial project are billed monthly and recognized as revenue as the services and other deliverables are provided 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds an asset s fair value 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the company to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from stock based payment arrangements 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning january  for all stock based awards granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on that date 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  as adjusted for an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted on or after january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
previously  the company had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
the grant date fair value of the awards generally vests over the service period 
the stock based compensation expense is included in sg a expenses 
sfas r requires management to make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options and restricted stock awards  including the vesting for restricted stock awards and options containing performance based vesting features  the expected term of stock options  an estimate of future forfeitures and the volatility of our stock price in the future 
these assumptions have an impact on the valuation assigned to equity awards and the associated recognition of expense 
on december   the board of directors of the company approved the accelerated vesting  effective as of december   of all unvested stock options granted to employees and non employee directors from through under the company s stock incentive plan  as well as options granted to the company s chief executive officer under his original employment agreement 
the acceleration of vesting of these options reduced non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in the company s income statement in and future periods in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r in january the board s decision to accelerate the vesting was based on such factors as of the options were out of the money  the options generally vested over the next three years  to reduce compensation expense that might be recorded in future periods following the adoption of sfas r  and  the company has decided to rely  to a substantial degree  on restricted stock as opposed to options in future incentive compensation awards
