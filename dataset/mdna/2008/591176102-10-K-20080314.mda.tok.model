the lead fabrication and recycling segment includes five lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california  carson city  nevada and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements

december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  the results of the scrap metal recycling segment operations depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the northeastern united states 
until recently  metals prices tracked historical patterns but the continued run up in metals prices in the last few years has made the cumulative price increase significantly larger than usual 
the drivers of the unusually strong run up in metals prices are well known  asian especially chinese demand and the prospect of continued short term supply shortages 
in the late s and the early s  there was low investment throughout the metals sector that followed a period of earlier price declines 
some analysts have suggested that the intensity of the price upswing in this recent cycle has been exacerbated by new factors the increasing weight of rapidly growing emerging markets especially china and india in the world economy and activity of financial investors especially fund managers in commodity markets 
ferrous recyclers saw lower average prices in the latter part of markets were affected by foreign buyers leaving the market for periods of time allowing domestic consumers to reduce their purchase prices 
since then however  prices have rebounded to record highs 
the increased demand can be attributed to continued expansion of foreign economies 
prices for non ferrous metals reached record levels in and continue into as the demand for metals continued to outpace supplies 
the global aluminum industry saw a tightening in supply in both years  thus pushing aluminum prices to year highs in early from january  through december   the prices of nickel and zinc have increased by and respectively  while copper prices have more than doubled during that same period 
in early  the price of platinum reached record levels of over  per ounce 
the scenario was similar in the case of other non ferrous metals on account of depleting stockpiles and sustained demand 
the lead fabrication segment is impacted by the price of lead 
the lead fabrication business can be positively affected by lower pricing of raw lead metals 
between december  and december   the spot price of lead on the london metal exchange increased 
in a business environment of increasing raw material costs like this  lead fabricators rely on their ability to pass on these increased lead raw material prices to maintain their profitability

the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability other than conditions existing at the syracuse facility prior to its acquisition by the company because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical 
however  we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings million under our senior secured credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc and other lenders and million pursuant to a financing agreement with ableco finance  llc 
borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
any increase in either the prime rate or libor will increase interest expense 
we have entered into an interest rate swap contract which would mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on million of the wells fargo foothill portion of the indebtedness 
assuming our variable borrowings were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year  with a corresponding change in cash flows 
commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for ferrous  non ferrous and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and import and export markets can be volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly instead of holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates
