the leases generally require that each tenant will have primary responsibility for complying with regulations  but failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities  awards of damages to private litigants  or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties 
item a 
risk factors 
carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
if any of the events or developments described below were actually to occur  nnn s business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
loss of revenues from tenants would reduce nnn s cash flow 
nnn s five largest tenants accounted for an aggregate of approximately percent of nnn s annual base rent as of december  the default  financial distress or bankruptcy of one or more of nnn s tenants could cause substantial vacancies among nnn s investment portfolio 
vacancies reduce nnn s revenues until nnn is able to re lease the affected properties and could decrease the ultimate sale value of each such vacant property 
upon the expiration of the leases that are currently in place  nnn may not be able to re lease a vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such re leasing 
a significant portion of the source of nnn s annual base rent is heavily concentrated in a specific industry classification and in specific geographic locations 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately percent of nnn s annual base rent is generated from two retail lines of trade  convenience stores and restaurants  each representing more than percent 
in addition  as of december   an aggregate of approximately percent of nnn s annual base rent is generated from properties in texas and florida  each representing more than percent 
any financial hardship and or changes in these industries or states could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial results 
there are a number of risks inherent in owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate 
nnn s economic performance and the value of its real estate assets are subject to the risk that if nnn s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet its operating expenses  including debt service  nnn s cash flow and ability to pay distributions to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
as a real estate company  nnn is susceptible to the following real estate industry risks  which are beyond its control changes in national  regional and local economic conditions and outlook  decreases in consumer spending and retail sales  
table of contents economic downturns in the areas where nnn s properties are located  adverse changes in local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply  reduction in demand or intense competition for tenants  changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of nnn s properties to tenants  zoning  regulatory restrictions  or change in taxes  and changes in interest rates or availability of financing 
all of these factors could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates  which could adversely affect nnn s results of operations 
nnn s real estate investments are illiquid 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  nnn s ability to adjust the portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited 
certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions  including i debt service if any  ii real estate taxes  and iii operating and maintenance costs 
this combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result  under certain market conditions  in reduced income from investment 
such reduction in investment income could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 
nnn may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities 
nnn may acquire a property that contains some level of contamination or potential contamination exists  subject to a determination of the level of risk and potential cost of remediation 
investments in real property create a potential for substantial environmental liability on the part of the owner of such property from the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property  regardless of fault 
it is nnn s policy  as a part of its acquisition due diligence process  generally to obtain an environmental site assessment for each property 
in such cases that nnn intends to acquire real estate where contamination or potential contamination exists  nnn generally requires the seller or tenant to i remediate the problem  ii indemnify nnn for environmental liabilities  or iii agree to other arrangements deemed appropriate by nnn to address environmental conditions at the property 
nnn has investment properties currently under some level of environmental remediation 
in general  the seller  the tenant or an adjacent land owner is responsible for the cost of the environmental remediation for each of these investment properties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or other inability on the part of these parties to cover these costs  nnn may have to cover the costs of remediation  fines or other environmental liabilities at these and other properties 
nnn may also own properties where required remediation has not begun or adverse environmental conditions have not yet been detected 
this may require remediation or otherwise subject nnn to liability 
nnn cannot assure that i it will not be required to undertake or pay for removal or remediation of any contamination of the properties currently or previously owned by nnn  ii nnn will not be subject to fines by governmental authorities or litigation  or iii the costs of such removal  remediation fines or litigation would not be material 
nnn may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies 
nnn cannot assure that it will be able to implement its investment strategies successfully 
additionally  nnn cannot assure that its property portfolio will expand at all  or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size 
in addition  investment in additional real estate assets is subject to a number of risks 
because nnn expects to invest in markets other than the ones in which its current properties are located or properties which may be leased to tenants other than those to which 
table of contents nnn has historically leased properties  nnn will also be subject to the risks associated with investment in new markets or with new tenants that may be relatively unfamiliar to nnn s management team 
nnn s development activities are subject to without limitation  risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals  the cost and timely completion of construction including risks from factors beyond nnn s control  such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages  the risk of finding tenants for the properties and the ability to obtain both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms 
these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and  under certain circumstances  could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken or provide a tenant the opportunity to terminate a lease 
any of these situations may delay or eliminate proceeds or cash flows nnn expects from these projects  which could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 
nnn may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy 
nnn may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition including its inventory properties due to adverse market conditions 
this may adversely affect  among other things  nnn s ability to sell under favorable terms  execute its operating strategy  achieve target earnings or returns  retire debt or pay dividends 
a change in the assumptions used to determine the value of commercial mortgage residual interests could adversely affect nnn s financial position 
as of december   the residuals had a carrying value of  the value of these residuals is based on discount rate  loan loss  prepayment speed and interest rate assumptions made by nnn to determine their value 
if actual experience differs materially from these assumptions  the actual future cash flow could be less than expected and the value of the residuals  as well as nnn s earnings  could decline 
nnn may suffer a loss in the event of a default or bankruptcy of a borrower 
if a borrower defaults on a mortgage  structured finance loan or other loan made by nnn  and does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the loan  nnn may suffer a loss of principal and interest 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn may not be able to recover against all of the assets of the borrower  or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy the balance due on the loan 
in addition  certain of nnn s loans may be subordinate to other debt of a borrower 
these investments are typically loans secured by a borrower s pledge of its ownership interests in the entity that owns the real estate or other assets 
these agreements are typically subordinated to senior loans secured by other loans encumbering the underlying real estate or assets 
subordinated positions are generally subject to a higher risk of nonpayment of principal and interest than the more senior loans 
as of december   mortgages and notes receivables had an outstanding principal balance of  and the structured finance investments had an outstanding principal balance of  if a borrower defaults on the debt senior to nnn s loan  or in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn s loan will be satisfied only after the borrower s senior creditors claims are satisfied 
where debt senior to nnn s loans exists  the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit nnn s ability to amend loan documents  assign the loans  accept prepayments  exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy proceedings and litigation can significantly increase the time needed for nnn to acquire underlying collateral in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 

table of contents certain provisions of the leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable 
nnn s rights and obligations with respect to its leases  structured finance loans  mortgage loans or other loans are governed by written agreements 
a court could determine that one or more provisions of an agreement are unenforceable  such as a particular remedy  a loan prepayment provision or a provision governing nnn s security interest in the underlying collateral of a borrower 
nnn could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to an asset or group of assets 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit nnn s control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships involve risks not otherwise present for direct investments by nnn 
it is possible that nnn s co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than nnn at any time and they may take actions contrary to nnn s requests  policies or objectives  including nnn s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investments include impasses on decisions  because no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership 
additionally  the partner may become insolvent or bankrupt 
competition with numerous other reits  commercial developers  real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede nnn s ability to grow 
nnn may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to complete suitable property acquisitions or developments on advantageous terms due to competition for such properties with others engaged in real estate investment activities 
nnn s inability to successfully acquire or develop new properties may affect nnn s ability to achieve anticipated return on investment  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
uninsured losses may adversely affect nnn s ability to pay outstanding indebtedness 
nnn s properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability  fire  flood  and extended coverage 
nnn believes that the insurance carried on its properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards 
there are  however  types of losses such as from hurricanes  wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits  nnn could lose both its invested capital and anticipated revenues from the property  whereby reducing nnn s cash flow 
acts of violence  terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which nnn operates and nnn s results of operations 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect nnn s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks may directly impact nnn s physical facilities or the businesses of its tenants 
the united states is engaged in armed conflict  which could have an impact on nnn s tenants 
the consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable  and nnn may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
more generally  any of these events or threats of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial 
table of contents markets and economies 
they also could result in  or cause a deepening of  economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on nnn s financial condition or results of operations 
vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect nnn 
as of december   nnn owned vacant  unleased investment properties  which accounted for approximately two percent of the total gross leasable area of nnn s investment portfolio  in addition to three vacant land parcels 
nnn is actively marketing these properties for sale or lease but may not be able to sell or lease these properties on favorable terms or at all 
the lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from the rejection by any bankrupt tenant of any of their respective leases with nnn could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations of nnn if nnn is unable to re lease the investment properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner 
less than one percent of the total gross leasable area of nnn s investment portfolio is leased to three tenants that have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their lease with nnn 
the amount of debt nnn has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect nnn s business and financial condition 
as of december   nnn had total mortgage debt and secured notes payable outstanding of approximately  total unsecured notes payable of  and  outstanding on the credit facility 
nnn s organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that it may incur 
if nnn incurs additional indebtedness and permits a higher degree of leverage  debt service requirements would increase and could adversely affect nnn s financial condition and results of operations  as well as nnn s ability to pay principal and interest on the outstanding indebtedness or dividends to its stockholders 
in addition  increased leverage could increase the risk that nnn may default on its debt obligations 
the credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions to nnn s common and preferred stockholders 
the amount of debt outstanding at any time could have important consequences to nnn s stockholders 
for example  it could require nnn to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  real estate investments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future  increase nnn s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit nnn s ability to obtain any additional financing it may need in the future for working capital  debt refinancing  capital expenditures  real estate investments  development or other general corporate purposes  make it difficult to satisfy nnn s debt service requirements  limit nnn s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit nnn s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the factors that affect the profitability of its business  and limit nnn s flexibility in conducting its business  which may place nnn at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 

table of contents nnn s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its debt  or to refinance such debt will depend primarily on its future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to the creditworthiness of its tenants  competition  as well as economic  financial  and other factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that nnn s business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt or meet its other cash needs 
if nnn is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from its business  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet its debt obligations and other cash needs 
nnn cannot assure you that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms and conditions  including but not limited to the interest rate  which nnn would find acceptable 
nnn is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt that could restrict its operating activities  and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under its debt 
nnn s unsecured debt contains various restrictive covenants which include  among others  provisions restricting nnn s ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  including dividend payments on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to nnn  enter into transactions with certain affiliates  create certain liens  and consolidate  merge or sell nnn s assets 
nnn s secured debt generally contains customary covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt  restricting its ability to sell  assign or further encumber the properties securing the debt  restricting its ability to incur additional debt  restricting its ability to amend or modify existing leases  and relating to certain prepayment restrictions 
nnn s ability to meet some of the covenants in its debt  including covenants related to the condition of the property or payment of real estate taxes  may be dependent on the performance by nnn s tenants under their leases 
in addition  certain covenants in nnn s debt  including its credit facility  require nnn  among other things  to maintain certain maximum leverage ratios  maintain certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios  limit dividends declared and paid to nnn s common and preferred stockholders  and limit investments in certain types of assets 

table of contents the market value of nnn s equity and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 
as with other publicly traded securities  the market price of nnn s equity and debt securities depends on various factors  which may change from time to time and may be unrelated to nnn s operating performance or prospects 
these factors include among many general economic and financial market conditions  level and trend of interest rates  nnn s financial condition and performance  market perception of nnn compared to other reits  and market perception of reits compared to other investment sectors 
nnn s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability 
nnn intends to operate in a manner that will allow nnn to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit 
nnn believes it has been organized as  and its past and present operations qualify nnn as a reit 
however  the internal revenue service  irs could successfully assert that nnn is not qualified as such 
in addition  nnn may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within nnn s control 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for nnn to qualify as a reit 
if nnn fails to qualify as a reit  it would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing taxable income and would become subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in this event  nnn could be subject to potentially significant tax liabilities and penalties 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  nnn would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost 
even if nnn maintains its reit status  nnn may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
even if nnn remains qualified as a reit  nnn may face other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow 
even if nnn remains qualified for taxation as a reit  nnn may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease earnings and cash available for distribution to stockholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  nnn holds some of its assets through the trs 

table of contents adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce the nnn s earnings  cash flow and market price of our common stock 
at any time  the federal and state income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may change 
any such changes may have retroactive effect  and could adversely affect nnn or its stockholders 
for example  legislation enacted in and extended in generally reduced the federal income tax rate on most dividends paid by corporations to individual investors to a maximum of percent through 
reit dividends  with limited exceptions  will not benefit from the rate reduction  because a reit s income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
as such  this legislation could cause shares in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than shares in reits  and could have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock 
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact nnn reported financial performance 
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how nnn records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the commission  who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards  may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of its financial statements 
these changes could have a material impact on nnn s reported financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  nnn could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in restating prior period financial statements 
compliance with reit requirements  including distribution requirements  may limit nnn s flexibility and negatively affect nnn s operating decisions 
to maintain its status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  nnn must meet certain requirements  on an on going basis  including requirements regarding its sources of income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts nnn distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its shares 
nnn may also be required to make distributions to its stockholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when nnn s funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures or to fund debt service requirements 
nnn generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to stockholders  providing it distributes percent of its reit taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a reit 
for each of the years in the three year period ended december   nnn believes it has qualified as a reit 
notwithstanding nnn s qualification for taxation as a reit  nnn is subject to certain state taxes on its income and real estate

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement to include a component of an entity 
accordingly  the results of operations related to these certain properties that have been classified as held for sale or have been disposed of subsequent to december   the effective date of sfas no 
 have been reclassified as earnings from discontinued operations 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance of a reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo is defined by nareit and is used by nnn as follows net earnings computed in accordance with gaap plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  excluding gains or including losses on the disposition of real estate held for investment  and nnn s share of these items from nnn s unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

table of contents ffo is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of operating performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of nnn s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of operating performance of an equity reit because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as an operating performance measure 
nnn s computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo used by other equity reits  and therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
nnn has earnings from discontinued operations in each of its segments  investment assets and inventory assets  real estate held for investment and real estate held for sale 
all property dispositions from nnn s investment segment are classified as discontinued operations 
in addition  certain properties in nnn s inventory segment that have generated revenues before disposition are classified as discontinued operations 
these inventory properties have not historically been classified as discontinued operations  therefore  prior period comparable consolidated financial statements have been restated to include these properties in its earnings from discontinued operations 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in nnn s reported total revenues and total and per share earnings from continuing operations and an increase in nnn s earnings from discontinued operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and the forward looking disclaimer language in italics before item business 
overview nnn s operations are divided into two primary business segments i investment assets  including real estate assets and mortgages  and notes receivable including structured finance investments on the consolidated balance sheets collectively  investment assets  and ii inventory real estate assets inventory assets 
the investment assets are operated through national retail properties  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
nnn acquires  owns  invests in  manages and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long term net leases investment properties or investment portfolio 
the inventory assets are operated through the trs 
the trs  directly and indirectly  through investment interests  owns real estate primarily for the purpose of selling the real estate inventory properties or inventory portfolio 
additionally  the trs acquires and develops inventory properties development properties or development portfolio and also acquires existing inventory properties exchange properties or exchange portfolio 
as of december   nnn owned investment properties  with an aggregate leasable area of  square feet  located in states 
approximately percent of nnn s investment portfolio was leased at december  in addition to the investment properties  as of december   nnn had  and  in mortgages and notes receivable including accrued interest receivable and commercial mortgage residual interests  respectively 
as of december   the trs owned development properties eight completed inventory  nine under construction and six land parcels and exchange properties 
nnn s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of nnn 
the key indicators for nnn include items such as the composition of nnn s investment portfolio and structured finance investments such as tenant  geographic and industry classification diversification  the occupancy rate of nnn s investment portfolio  certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures  industry trends and performance compared to that of nnn  and returns nnn receives on its invested capital 
the growth of the investment portfolio from properties to properties over the three years ending december  has increased property diversification 
nnn has increased its investments in the convenience store sector 
this sector represents a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace which nnn believes represents an area of attractive investment opportunity 
similarly  nnn has some geographic concentration in the south and southeast which nnn believes are areas of above average population growth 
nnn formed a joint venture with an institutional investor in this joint venture plans to acquire up to million of real estate assets leased to convenience store operators 
nnn owns a percent equity ownership interest in the joint venture which mitigates nnn s convenience store sector concentration compared to acquiring these assets in the investment portfolio 
additionally  the joint venture provides an additional source of capital to fund property acquisitions 

table of contents as of december   and  occupancy of the investment portfolio has averaged percent 
the investment portfolio s average remaining lease term of years has remained fairly constant over the past three years which  coupled with its net lease structure  provide enhanced probability of maintaining occupancy and operating earnings in periods of soft economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions which in turn could have a material impact on nnn s financial statements 
a summary of nnn s accounting policies and procedures are included in note of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies among others affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
real estate investment portfolio 
nnn records the acquisition of real estate at cost  including acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of properties developed by nnn includes direct and indirect costs of construction  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease for acquisitions of real estate subject to a lease subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  value of in place leases  and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their relative fair values 
real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repairs 
the leases are accounted for using either the operating or the direct financing method 
such methods are described below operating method leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate 
revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses including depreciation are charged to operations as incurred 
buildings are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold interests are amortized on the straight line method over the terms of their respective leases 
when scheduled rentals vary during the lease term  income is recognized on a straight line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease 
accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight line basis 
direct financing method leases accounted for using the direct financing method are recorded at their net investment which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property 
unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on nnn s net investment in the leases 

table of contents management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through operations 
management determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the residual value of the real estate  with the carrying cost of the individual asset 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
real estate inventory portfolio 
the trs acquires and or develops and owns properties for the purpose of re sale 
the properties that are classified as held for sale at any given time may consist of properties that have been acquired in the marketplace with the intent to sell and properties that have been  or are currently being  constructed by the trs 
the trs records the acquisition of the real estate at cost  including the acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of the real estate developed by the trs includes direct and indirect costs of construction  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 
real estate held for sale is not depreciated 
commercial mortgage residual interest at fair value 
commercial mortgage residual interests  classified as available for sale  are reported at their market values with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the commercial mortgage residual interests were acquired in connection with the acquisition of percent equity interest of oami 
nnn recognizes the excess of all cash flows attributable to the commercial mortgage residual interests estimated at the acquisition transaction date over the initial investment the accretable yield as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
losses are considered other than temporary valuation impairments if and when there has been a change in the timing or amount of estimated cash flows  exclusive of changes in interest rates  that leads to a loss in value 
certain of the commercial mortgage residual interests have been pledged as security for notes payable 
revenue recognition 
rental revenues for non development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  based on the terms of the lease at the time of acquisition of the leased asset 
rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant 
use of estimates 
additional critical accounting policies of nnn include management s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
additional critical accounting policies include management s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate assets  the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including the commercial mortgage residual interests  the collectibility of receivables from tenants  including accrued rental income  and capitalized overhead relating to development projects 
actual results could differ from those estimates
