table of contents item a 
risk factors in evaluating the company  careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and or financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company s common stock 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
a decline in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic and consumer credit conditions could hinder our product revenues and earnings 
our success in generating sales of our products to consumers depends upon a number of factors  including economic factors impacting disposable consumer income  including economic conditions and factors such as employment  general business conditions  consumer confidence  prevailing interest rates and changes in tax laws 
in addition  spending patterns of consumers may be affected by changes in the amount or severity of inclement weather  the acceptability of us brands in international markets and the growth or decline of global footwear markets 
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending or economic conditions 
our business is substantially affected by the weather conditions  and sustained periods of warm and or dry weather can negatively impact our sales 
additionally  such weather conditions may negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period sales 
we sell our products into two primary markets  work and outdoor 
for the year ended december   of our annual revenues were to the outdoor market 
this market segment is highly seasonal and weather dependent 
sales of these products are largely dependent on the timing and severity of weather in the different regions of the united states 
during sustained periods of warm and or dry weather conditions  certain key categories in the outdoor market may be negatively impacted  including hunting  hiking and cold weather products  as consumers postpone participation in those activities pending the resumption of more conducive weather patterns 
additionally  given our advance ordering timelines  such reduced demand during normal outdoor market seasons may also negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period profits as such excess inventories are sold 
we conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing activities and a certain portion of our net sales occurs outside the us  and therefore  we are subject to the risks of international commerce 
also  any adverse political conditions or governmental actions  including the imposition of duties and quotas  internally within china where the majority of our third party manufacturers are concentrated or externally with the united states could disrupt our supply of product to customers 
we use third party manufacturers located in foreign countries  primarily in china  to manufacture the majority of our products  including all of our lacrosse branded products 
we also sell a growing percentage of our products to retailers outside of the us foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks  including the following delays associated with the manufacture  transportation and delivery of foreign sourced products  tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules  increased transportation costs due to rising energy prices  more burdensome port security procedures  or other factors  delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns  foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro and chinese renminbi  a risk for which we do not currently seek to mitigate through hedging transactions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  
table of contents changing economic conditions  restrictions  due to privacy laws  on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information  changes in governmental policies and regulations  political unrest  terrorism or war  any of which can interrupt commerce  expropriation and nationalization  difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the us  difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  limited capital of foreign distributors and the possibility that such distributors may terminate their operations or their relationships with us  and concentration of credit risk  currency  and political risks associated with international distributors 
international distributors represented of our net sales in additionally  although net sales outside of the us did not constitute a significant portion of our revenues in  we expect our international sales will grow over the next few years 
our ability to continue to do business in international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations  as noted above  as well as the difficulties associated with promoting products in emerging markets 
we are also subject to additional risk as the company has a limited number of foreign distributors  who may have inadequate capital to continue operations over the long term 
sales to the international markets are achieved through those foreign distributors 
the company s sales and sales growth may be adversely affected if the relationship with those distributors were to deteriorate and we are unable to engage suitable alternatives in a timely manner 
if we do not accurately forecast consumer demand  we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers orders  either of which could adversely affect our business 
the footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations and declines in performance  as well as fashion risks and rapid changes in consumer preferences  the effects of weather  general economic conditions and other factors affecting demand 
furthermore  the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for the design and manufacture of products 
consequently  we must commit to production based on our forecasts of consumer demand 
if we overestimate demand for our products  we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at a discount to customers  resulting in markdowns and lower gross margins 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand  we could have inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strains on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
a decline in demand for our products  or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the continued consolidation of domestic retailers  and their capital requirements to fund growth  increases and concentrates our credit risk 
significant retailers in the work and outdoor retail industry continue to expand rapidly through construction of additional stores and acquisitions 
further  the industry continues to experience consolidation  resulting in a smaller number of primary retailers 
the increased capital requirement required to open and operate new stores concentrates the company s credit risk in a relatively small number of customers 
if these retailers were to extinguish their capital and were unable to replenish their liquidity  there is a risk that their outstanding payables to our company may not be paid 

table of contents because we depend on third party manufacturers  we face challenges in maintaining a timely supply of goods to meet sales demand  and we may experience delay or interruptions in our supply chain 
any shortfall or delay in the supply of our products may decrease our sales and have an adverse impact on our customer relationships 
third party manufacturers produce approximately of our footwear products 
currently  we have footwear manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers located in china  thailand  and europe 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over the third party manufacturers  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
due to various potential factors outside of our control  one or more of our third party manufacturers may be unable to continue meeting our production requirements 
also  certain of our third party manufacturers have manufacturing engagements with companies that are much larger than we are and whose production needs are much greater than ours 
as a result  such manufacturers may choose to devote additional resources to the production of products other than ours if capacity is limited 
in addition  we do not have long term supply contracts with these third party manufacturers  and any of them could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of products of an acceptable quality and price from our third party manufacturers 
we may be unable to offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in our company operated manufacturing facilities due to capacity constraints  and we may be unable to substitute suitable alternative third party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices 
any disruption in the supply of products from our third party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to efficiently import foreign sourced products could result in decreased margins  cancelled orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation 
our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide 
labor disputes at various ports create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
furthermore  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
labor disruptions or disruptions due to natural disasters or casualty losses at one of our three distribution facilities or our domestic manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have distribution centers in portland  oregon and lacrosse  wisconsin and a domestic manufacturing facility in portland  oregon 
some of the employees at each of these facilities are organized in labor unions 
our inability to renew on favorable terms the collective bargaining agreements between us and the unions that represent our employees  or any strike  work stoppage or other labor disruption could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents in addition  any natural disaster or other serious disruption at one of these facilities due to fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or manmade cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our warehouse as a docking location for product 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our financial success may be limited by the strength of our relationships with our retail customers and by the success of such retail customers 
our financial success is significantly related to the willingness of our retail customers to continue to carry our products and to the success of such customers in selling our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our retail customers  and sales to our retail customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer 
if we cannot fill our retail customers orders in a timely manner  the sales of our products and our relationships with those customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and ability to grow our product line 
our five largest retail customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
if any of our major retail customers experiences a significant downturn in their business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us 
in addition  we extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
if a significant customer to whom we have extended credit experiences financial difficulties  our bad debt expense may increase relative to revenues in the future 
any significant increase in our bad debt expense relative to revenues would adversely impact our net income and cash flow and could affect our ability to pay our own obligations as they become due 
we face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively  sales of our products may decline and our business could be harmed 
the footwear industry is highly competitive 
recent growth in the market for outdoor and work footwear has encouraged the entry of new competitors into the marketplace and has increased competition from established companies 
some of our competitors have products with similar characteristics  such as design and materials  to a number of our products 
in addition  access to offshore manufacturing is also making it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete 
our competitors include footwear manufacturers  fashion oriented footwear marketers  vertically integrated specialty stores and retailers of private label products 
the principal competitive differentiators in our industry include product design  product performance  quality  brand image  price  marketing and promotion  customer support and service  the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers  obtaining access to retail outlets and sufficient floor space 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we have  have more comprehensive product lines than ours  have broader market presence than we have in retail outlets  or have their own retail outlets  have longer standing relationships with retailers than we have  have greater distribution capabilities than we have  have stronger brand recognition than we have  and spend substantially more on product advertising than we do 
our competitors greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry  compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products 
in addition  a major marketing or promotional success or technological innovation by one of our competitors could adversely impact our competitive position 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future  
table of contents our sales and profits may decline  our financial condition may deteriorate and the market price of our common stock may fall 
in addition  a growing trend in the footwear industry is for dealers and distributors to source product directly from overseas manufacturers in order to increase profitability by eliminating the wholesale distributor or manufacturer 
while dealers and distributors have not historically manufactured and developed new and innovative products  if consumers largely accept the directly sourced products  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unable to meet changing consumer preferences and demands 
the footwear industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and functional products at a pace  intensity  and price that is competitive with other brands in our market 
in addition  we must design and manufacture products that appeal to many consumer segments at a range of price points 
while we continually update our product line with new and innovative products  our products may not continue to be popular and new products we may introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
our failure to anticipate  identify and react to shifts in consumer preferences and maintain a strong brand image could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
changes in the price or availability of raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results 
also  our product costs are subject to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro and chinese renminbi  oil price increases and higher foreign labor costs 
if we are unable to increase our selling prices to offset such product cost increases  our revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted 
we purchase raw materials and component parts from various suppliers to be used in the manufacturing of our products 
changes in our relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of purchased raw materials or component parts could result in manufacturing interruptions  delays  inefficiencies or our inability to successfully market our products 
we also rely on transport companies to deliver our products from abroad to our distribution centers  and in some cases directly to our customers 
if petroleum costs were to increase it could result in significantly higher freight costs to our company 
increased petroleum costs also affect our manufacturing costs  as rubber is a key component of our footwear 
our profit margins may decrease if prices of purchased raw materials  component parts  finished goods  or petroleum increase and we are unable to pass on those additional costs to our customers 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position and reduce future revenues 
protecting our intellectual property is an important factor in maintaining our brand and our competitive position in the footwear industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
we have a number of licensing agreements  both for product  camouflage patterns and trademarks  which are significant to our business 
if the company is unable to renew the agreements  and suitable replacements are not available in a timely manner  this may reduce revenues 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials  and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs 
we depend on a limited number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear 
for example  we and our suppliers purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both our lacrosse and danner footwear 
over of danner styles are gore tex lined 
we have contracts with gore that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
while we consider our relationship with gore to be good  if gore were to terminate our agreements  the time required to obtain substitute materials could interrupt our production cycle 
further  consumers may be unwilling to accept any such replacement material 
any termination or delay in our supply of gore tex waterproof fabric or the loss of our ability to use the gore tex mark in association with our products  or in the procurement of any other key product component  could result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strained relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  including joseph p 
schneider  our president and chief executive officer  and david p 
carlson  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  product development engineers  sales people  and others 
we face intense competition for such individuals throughout the footwear and work and outdoor products industries 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated 
our revolving credit facility contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
however  among other factors  our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results  which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non compliance  we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable  which could harm our business 
at december   we had no outstanding balances due under this financial arrangement 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws and wisconsin corporate law each contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management 
among other things  these provisions classify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and establish advance notice and other procedural requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions  which may prevent a change of control and or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable 
in addition  subchapter xi of the wisconsin business corporation law includes provisions that may discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control of us 
any 
table of contents delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to maximize the work and outdoor experience for our consumers 
to achieve this  we design  develop  manufacture and market premium quality  high performance footwear and apparel  supported by compelling marketing and superior customer service 
our products are primarily directed at both the retail consumer and the safety and industrial channels of distribution 
economic indicators that are important to our business include consumer confidence and unemployment rates 
increasing consumer confidence trends improve retail channel product sales  and increasing employment trends improve safety and industrial channel and the broader work market sales 
our trusted danner and lacrosse brands are distributed domestically through a nationwide network of specialty retailers and distributors  and internationally through distributors and retailers in asia  europe and canada 
additionally  we operate four websites for use by our consumers and retailers  and we operate a retail outlet store at our manufacturing facility in portland  oregon 
we focus on two types of consumers for our footwear and apparel lines work and outdoor 
work consumers include people in law enforcement  transportation  firefighting  construction  military services and other occupations that require high performance and protective footwear as a critical tool for the job 
outdoor consumers include people active in hunting  outdoor cross training  hiking and other outdoor recreational activities 
weather  especially in the fall and winter  has been  and will likely continue to be  a significant contributing factor impacting our financial performance 
sales are typically higher in the second half of the year due to stronger demand for our cold and wet weather outdoor product offerings 
we augment these offerings by infusing innovative technology into all product categories with the intent to create additional demand in all four quarters of the year 
we have achieved consistent growth in our core business in recent years  driven by our consumers demand for our innovative footwear and apparel products 
our sales and earnings growth continue to be driven by the success of our new product lines and our ability to meet at once demand 
during  we achieved record annual gross margins and profits  and continued to improve our cash position and leverage our operating expenses while investing in growing various aspects of our business

these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts and non defective returns according to our standard sales agreement  ownership of our products transfers to the customer when the product is delivered to a third party carrier at one of our distribution facilities 
therefore  the amount of revenue recognized does not require a material level of judgment or subjectivity 
however  significant judgment is required when determining the allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts  and non defective returns  each of which reduces the amount of accounts receivable and operating income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our historical experience of write offs of uncollectible accounts has been insignificant 
however  based on our assessments of payment histories and current creditworthiness of our customers  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  and million at december  in addition to an allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for anticipated cash discounts to be taken by customers and for non defective returns 
cash discounts are provided under certain customer service programs and are estimated based on available programs and historical usage rates 
reserves for non defective returns are estimated based on historical rates of returns 
these combined reserves total million at december  and million at december  allowance for slow moving inventory provision for potentially slow moving or excess inventories is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  future sales forecasts and current estimated market values 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
these reserves total million and million at december  and  respectively 
product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our limited warranty requires us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer within a specified time period after sale 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims 
we utilize historical trends and information received from customers to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels  which were million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill  and property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill of million and the investments we have made in our other long term investments  primarily property and equipment  we have made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
please refer to the risk factors in part i  item ia for a discussion of factors that may have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note  compensation and benefit agreements to our annual consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations  our future expense and equity 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a in this annual report on form k for further sensitivity analysis regarding our estimated pension obligation 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance our deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance at december  and is related entirely to state net operating loss nol carryforwards for which the realization is dependent on having taxable income in a certain state well into the future 
currently  our projected levels of taxable income in such state are not sufficient to reduce the valuation allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we will assess the future realization of the state nol deferred tax assets to determine if any reductions in the valuation allowance are needed 
the valuation reserve balance was million at december  and stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment sfas r on january  sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of income over the requisite service periods 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  share based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to calculate the share based compensation expense under sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of option based awards on the date of grant is impacted by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding certain highly subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the anticipated risk free interest rate  anticipated dividend yields and the expected life of the options 
the anticipated risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options granted 
the expected volatility  life of options and dividend yield are based on historical experience 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  accounts payable  and issued debt 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  reporting them as equity separate from the parent entity s equity  as well as requiring expanded disclosures 
sfas r and sfas are effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas r and sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
at our option  our line of credit interest rate is either the prime rate minus or the libor rate plus 
we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates 
based on an average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would impact the company s interest expense by approximately million 
we are also exposed to market risk related to the assumptions we make in estimating our pension liability 
the assumed discount rate used  in part  to calculate the pension plan obligation is related to the prevailing long term interest rates 
at december   we used an estimated discount rate of 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the actuarial present value of projected pension benefits of approximately million at december  with a similar charge to equity 
furthermore  a one percent change increase or decrease in the actual rate of return on pension plan assets would affect the charge to equity by approximately million
