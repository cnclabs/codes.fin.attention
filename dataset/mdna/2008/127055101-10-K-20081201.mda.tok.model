item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our strategy is to deliver earnings growth through leadership in performance materials 
we intend to achieve this goal by focusing on margin improvement  capacity expansion and emerging market growth  developing new products and businesses and actively managing our portfolio of businesses 
drivers of demand and key factors affecting profitability in our core segment  demand in the rubber blacks business is influenced primarily by vehicle miles driven and automotive builds 
rubber blacks results have been driven by changes in raw material costs  our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in raw material costs  global and regional capacity utilization and fixed cost savings achieved from capacity management and technology investment  including the positive impact of energy utilization technology at our manufacturing facilities 
our ability to obtain sales price increases is in part influenced by the time lag of pricing adjustments in our annual and long term supply contracts that contain feedstock related pricing formulas 
in the supermetals business  demand for tantalum is largely driven by the number of electronic devices produced using tantalum capacitors versus competing materials 
over the past several years capacitors have been made using high efficiency powders that require a lower volume of tantalum powder to achieve the same capacitance  reducing overall demand 
profitability in recent years has largely been determined by our ability to replace volumes that had historically been under contract  the cost of ore under our long term raw materials supply contract  our ability to implement cost reduction initiatives and a highly competitive market environment 
in our performance segment  demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure  automotive  and electronics and consumer products industries and by increasing demand for our products in emerging markets 
results in the performance segment have been driven by growth in emerging markets  delivering differentiated products that drive performance in customers applications  changes in raw material and energy costs and by our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in these costs 
in our new business segment  demand for our inkjet colorants and the results of the inkjet colorants business have been driven by a relative increase of printer platforms using our pigments at both new and existing oem customers and by the inkjet printer cartridge aftermarket 
over the past several years advances in inkjet technology  particularly in printhead and colorant efficiency  have enabled inkjet cartridge manufacturers to achieve similar print quality with less ink  leading to a decreased demand for inkjet pigments 
demand in our aerogel business has been driven by the continued evolution to superior methods of insulating to meet regulatory requirements  space considerations and aesthetic needs 
superior micropowders continues to be in an early formative stage and does not currently generate material commercial revenue 
in our specialty fluids segment  demand for cesium formate is primarily driven by the level of drilling of high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application 
results in the specialty fluids business have been driven by the size and type of jobs  the percentage of our total available fluid being utilized in any given period and our ability to expand the use of our fluids outside of the north sea 
operating results for fiscal during fiscal  we began to experience the impact of the recent financial and economic crisis 
our product  industry and geographic diversification provided us some stability during most of the year as downturns in demand in north america and western europe were offset by continued growth in emerging markets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  demand slowed in all regions as the economic softness took on a more global scope 
our rubber blacks business was unfavorably impacted by rapidly rising raw material costs that outpaced price increases during the year  but we were successful in reducing 
table of contents manufacturing spending and maintaining stable volumes 
these efforts led to improved profitability despite a million unfavorable impact from the timing of pricing adjustments in our rubber blacks supply contracts 
the supermetals business was unfavorably impacted by lower prices and volumes during the year and by higher average raw material costs under our long term tantalum ore supply contract 
during the year this business continued to reduce its inventory levels  generating million of cash and reducing its net working capital by million 
in the performance segment  despite increased volumes in both performance products and fumed metal oxides  results were significantly affected by higher raw material and energy costs that could not be fully offset by increased pricing 
the new business segment successfully increased revenues in key market segments during the year and took actions to eliminate under performing projects leading to lower costs 
in the specialty fluids segment  we continued to expand our geographic reach  increasing the number of wells using our fluid outside of the north sea 
these successes included projects in kazakhstan and the asia pacific region 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if i the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and ii different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment  the revenue is deferred until product acceptance has occurred 
shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

table of contents the following table summarizes the percentages of total revenue recognized in each of our reportable segments 
other operating revenues  which represent less than two percent of total revenues  include tolling  servicing and royalties for licensed technology years ended september core segment rubber blacks business supermetals business performance segment new business segment specialty fluids segment as indicated above  we derive a substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in our rubber blacks business and performance segment 
revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
we offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations 
we periodically review the assumptions underlying the estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly 
certain rubber blacks business and performance segment customer contracts contain price protection clauses that provide for the potential reduction in past or future sales prices under specific circumstances 
we analyze these contract provisions to determine if an obligation related to these clauses exists and record revenue net of any estimated protection commitments 
supermetals revenues also are generally recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in years prior to fiscal  certain supermetals business customer contracts contained price protection clauses that provided for potential reductions in past or future sales prices under specific circumstances 
we analyzed these contract provisions to determine if an obligation related to these clauses existed and recorded revenue net of any estimated protection commitments 
the majority of the revenue in the specialty fluids business arises from the rental of cesium formate 
this revenue is recognized through the rental period based on the contracted rental terms 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
changes in the allowance during fiscal and were not material 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and september   respectively 
the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs  the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability 
for example  the significant increase in carbon black feedstock costs during fiscal caused our reported cost of sales in our rubber blacks and performance products businesses to be higher than they would have been had we used an inventory valuation method other than lifo 
under our current lifo method  when raw material costs are rising  our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to cost of sales 
if  however  we were using a fifo method  our 
table of contents purchases from days earlier  which were at lower prices  would instead be the first charged to cost of sales 
the opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs 
at certain times  we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the lifo method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated 
the inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs 
if there is a liquidation of an inventory layer  there may be an impact to our cost of sales and net income for that period 
if the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost  there would be a reduction in our cost of sales and an increase to our net income during the period 
conversely  if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost  there will be an increase in our cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period 
we review inventory for potential obsolescence periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unsaleable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is adjusted to its market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  however  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings 
stock based compensation we follow the methodology of statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
r  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective approach to account for all of our stock based awards 
historically  we have issued significantly more shares of restricted stock than stock options under our equity compensation plans 
the fair value of restricted stock under fas r is based on intrinsic value at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
there are no significant estimates involved in recording compensation costs under the intrinsic value method with the exception of one we make around the probability of forfeitures 
changes in the forfeiture assumption could impact our earnings but would not impact our cash flows 
stock option valuation  on the other hand  requires a number of assumptions to be made 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity compensation plans 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we make a variety of assumptions and estimates  including discount rates  forfeiture rates  volatility measures  expected dividends and expected option lives 
changes to such assumptions and estimates can result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings 
such changes would not impact our cash flows 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas 
we perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test whether an impairment exists  the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is estimated based on discounted future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value is sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on management s best estimates about selling prices  production and sales volumes  costs  future growth rates  capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value is recorded 
while this would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
no impairments were recorded in fiscal  or 
table of contents valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily include property  plant  equipment  long term investments and assets held for rent 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
we make various estimates and assumptions when analyzing whether there is an impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and long term investments 
these estimates and assumptions include determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life of the asset over which the cash flows will occur  their amounts and the asset s residual value  if any 
an asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset 
the impairment loss is determined by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our estimated future cash flows reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset 
while an impairment charge would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
the fair values of long term investments are dependent on the financial performance of the entities in which we invest and the external factors inherent in the markets in which these entities operate 
we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investment entities when assessing the potential impairment of these investments 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments 
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate fair value with the exception of certain long term debt that has not been designated with a fair value hedge 
this portion of long term debt is recorded at face value 
the fair values of our derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if designated as part of a hedge transaction  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes 
although these derivatives are not designated as hedges  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we record in earnings the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges 
recently  the ability of financial counterparties to perform under these financial instruments has become less certain 
we attempt to take into account the financial viability of counterparties in both valuing the instruments and determining their effectiveness as hedging instruments 
if a counterparty was unable to perform  our ability to qualify for hedging certain transactions would be compromised and the realizable value of these financial instruments would be uncertain 
as a result  our results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

table of contents we carry a variety of different cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually assess the liquidity of cash and cash equivalents and as of september   we have determined that they are readily convertible to cash 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans where applicable and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
the most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets 
assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied  they include estimated discount rates  rates of compensation increases for employees  mortality  employee turnover and other related demographic data 
projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends 
we compute our recorded obligations globally in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
under such principles  if actual results differ from what is projected  the differences are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
however  cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
self insurance reserves we are partially self insured for certain third party liability  workers compensation and employee medical benefits in the united states 
the third party and workers compensation liabilities are managed through a wholly owned insurance captive and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
the employee medical obligations are managed by a third party provider and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
to limit our potential liabilities for these risks  however  we purchase insurance from third parties that provides individual and aggregate stop loss protection 
the aggregate self insured liability for combined workers compensation and third party liabilities in the united states in fiscal is million  and the retention for medical costs in the united states is at most  per person per annum 
we have accrued amounts equal to the actuarially determined future liabilities 
we determine the actuarial assumptions in collaboration with third party actuaries  based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal actions  medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and impact our earnings and cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  and interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
pursuant to fas  companies are required to estimate incremental costs for special handling  removal and disposal costs of materials that may or will give rise to conditional asset retirement obligations aros and then discount the expected costs back to the current year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
fin clarified that aro liabilities and costs must be recognized when the timing and or settlement can be reasonably estimated 
if it is unclear when  or if  an aro will be triggered  companies are required to use probability weightings for possible timing scenarios to determine the amounts that should be recognized in their financial statements 
the estimation of aros is subject to a number of inherent uncertainties including a the timing of when any aro may be incurred  b the ability to accurately identify and reasonably estimate the costs of 
table of contents all materials that may require special handling or treatment  c the ability to assess the relative probability of different scenarios that could give rise to an aro  and d other factors outside a company s control  including changes in regulations  costs and interest rates 
aros have not been recognized for certain of our facilities because either the present value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable facility life or we do not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities 
in most circumstances where aros have been recorded  the anticipated cash outflows will likely take place far into the future 
accordingly  actual costs and the timing of such costs may vary significantly from our estimates  which may  in turn  impact our earnings 
in general  however  when such estimates change  the impact is spread over future years and thus the impact on any individual year is unlikely to be material 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute  and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
the amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending silica and non malignant asbestos claims  iii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iv significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  v changes in the nature of claims received  vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vii the financial viability of members of the payor group  viii a change in the availability of ao s insurance coverage  ix changes in the allocation of costs among the payor group and x a determination that our interpretation of the contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability is inaccurate 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
further  if the timing of our actual payments made for respirator claims differs significantly from our estimated payment schedule  and we could no longer reasonably predict the timing of such payments  we could then be required to record the reserve amount on an undiscounted basis on our consolidated balance sheets  causing an immediate impact to earnings 

table of contents income taxes our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
certain of these reserves are for uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns which are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin we adopted fin effective october  and recorded a cumulative effect of less than a million increase to retained earnings 
fin requires us to record obligations for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
if this threshold is not met  the full amount of the uncertain tax position is recorded as a liability 
if the threshold is met  the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this analysis presumes the taxing authorities full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts  but does not consider the time value of money 
we also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
reserves for taxes which are not based on income where we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable continue to be accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
for example  our results for the first quarter of fiscal included million of tax credits in china  while our results for the second quarter of fiscal reflected a reversal of million of these credits due to a change in our evaluation of their availability for carryforward 
additionally  in accordance with fas no 
accounting for income taxes we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time 
we review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets 
an increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense  lower stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees which are based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to vacate certain facilities and 
table of contents asset impairments 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
these deviations may lead to changes in estimates  which would then be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas 
fas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of benefit plans  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the plan s benefit obligations  in its statement of financial position 
as of september   we adopted the balance sheet impact of reflecting the funded status of the plans using a june measurement date 
fas also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end 
the change in measurement date to september was required on or before september  we elected to early adopt the change in measurement date on september   using the alternative method that resulted in a million decrease to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect fair value measurements have on earnings 
the primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures are valuing pension plan assets and liabilities  valuing hedge related derivative financial instruments  allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  and evaluating long term assets for potential impairment 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for us for the first quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of fas will increase disclosures in our consolidated financial statements but will have no affect on our consolidated results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
fas is effective for us for the first quarter of fiscal we have not made any elections to use fair value under fas as of october  in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
fas r is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combination we enter into after september  will be subject to this new standard 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in the parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
fas also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
fas is effective for us for the first quarter of fiscal  ending on december  we are evaluating the impact of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas will be effective for cabot beginning on january  we are evaluating the effect of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during the third quarter of fiscal  management changed its business and regional organizational structure 
under the new organizational structure  cabot is organized into four business segments the core segment  which is further disaggregated for financial reporting purposes into the rubber blacks and the supermetals businesses  the performance segment  the new business segment and the specialty fluids segment 
under the new regional structure  cabot is organized into three geographic regions the americas  which includes north and south america  europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific  including china 
discussions of current and prior year periods reflect these new structures 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales and gross profit years ended september dollars in millions net sales gross profit the million increase in sales in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher prices million and the benefit of foreign currency translation on our sales million 
these positive factors were partially offset by slightly lower volumes million  principally associated with the expiration of a fixed price  fixed volume contract in the supermetals business in fiscal that resulted in an unfavorable comparison for fiscal the million increase in sales in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher volumes million and the benefit of foreign currency translation on our sales million 
these factors were partially offset by lower pricing million  principally resulting from the feedstock related pricing mechanism in our rubber blacks supply contracts and the expiration of fixed price  fixed volume contracts in the supermetals business 
additionally  we had million of revenue related to our transportation of a third party s carbon black feedstock cargo in fiscal that did not reoccur in fiscal 
table of contents our gross profit was of net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal gross profit decreased in fiscal as raw material cost increases outpaced pricing increases 
in fiscal gross profit increased as the impact of higher volumes and lower relative raw material costs more than offset lower pricing 
selling and administrative expenses years ended september dollars in millions selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily due to a million favorable comparison from the fiscal settlement of the federal carbon black antitrust litigation 
this was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on our expenses 
the million increase in expenses in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the aforementioned settlement and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
research and technical expenses years ended september dollars in millions research and technical expenses research and technical expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased spending in the performance segment for the continued development of differentiated products 
the million increase in expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased spending associated with new business development opportunities  including the acquisition of million of in process research and development technology in the supermetals business 
interest and dividend income years ended september dollars in millions interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal  and increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the variability in interest income is due principally to differences in cash balances available for interest earning investments in the comparative periods 
interest expense years ended september dollars in millions interest expense interest expense increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal  and by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increases in interest expense in both periods are due principally to increases in debt levels 

table of contents other income charges years ended september dollars in millions other income charges other income charges decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal and increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the variability in other income is principally due to foreign currency transaction gains or losses in the comparative periods driven by fluctuations in foreign currencies against the us dollar 
provision for income taxes years ended september dollars in millions provision for income taxes tax rate on income from continuing operations the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate on income from continuing operations 
our tax rate varies from the us statutory rate of for a variety of reasons

table of contents equity in net income of affiliates and minority interest in net income  net of tax years ended september dollars in millions equity in net income of affiliates minority interest in net income  net of tax equity in net income of affiliates decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to a million decrease in earnings of our affiliates in venezuela and mexico and million from the april  consolidation of results of our equity affiliate in malaysia 
our share of earnings from equity affiliates was million in both fiscal and  as increased earnings from our affiliates in mexico  venezuela and malaysia offset the equity earnings of cabot japan  which was consolidated as of november the increases in minority interest in net income  net of tax  of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  were primarily due to increased earnings of our joint ventures in china 
discontinued operations in fiscal we did not record material income or charges related to discontinued operations 
in fiscal  we recorded income from discontinued operations of million  which included tax benefits of million  offset by a charge of less than million for legal settlements 
during fiscal  we recorded income from discontinued operations of million relating to favorable tax settlements 
net income we reported net income for fiscal of million per diluted common share 
this is compared to net income of million per diluted common share for fiscal and million per diluted common share for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal by business segment the following discussion of results includes information on our reportable segment sales and segment or business operating profit before tax pbt 
segment pbt is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace income loss from operations before taxes  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
in calculating segment pbt we exclude certain items  meaning items that are significant and unusual or infrequent and not believed to reflect the true underlying business performance 
further  in calculating segment pbt we include equity in net income of affiliated companies  royalties paid by equity affiliates  minority interest and allocated corporate costs but exclude interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  interest income and dividend income 
our chief operating decision maker uses segment pbt to evaluate changes in the operating results of each segment before non operating factors and before certain items and to allocate resources to the segments 
we believe that this non gaap measure also assists our investors in evaluating the changes in our results and performance 
a reconciliation of segment pbt and income loss from operations before taxes is set forth below 
when explaining the changes in our pbt between periods  we use several terms 
the term fixed costs means fixed manufacturing costs  including utilities 
the term product mix refers to the various types and grades  or mix  of products sold in a particular business or segment during the period  and the positive or negative impact of that mix on the variable margin and profitability of the business or segment 
the term lifo impact includes two factors i the impact of current  generally higher  inventory cost being recognized immediately in cost of goods sold cogs under a last in first out method  compared to the older costs that would have been included in cogs under a first in first out method cogs impact  and ii the impact of reductions in inventory quantities  causing historical  generally lower  inventory costs to flow through cogs liquidation impact

the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the euro and british pound 
core segment sales and pbt for the rubber blacks and supermetals businesses  which together comprise the core segment  for fiscal  and are as follows years ended september dollars in millions rubber blacks business sales supermetals business sales segment sales rubber blacks business pbt supermetals business pbt segment pbt rubber blacks business the million increase in sales in the rubber blacks business in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher prices million resulting from feedstock related price increases and the benefit of foreign currency translation on our sales million 
volumes for fiscal were flat compared to fiscal as lower volumes in north america and europe offset strong growth in asia pacific 
the million increase in sales in the rubber blacks business in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to increased volumes million and the benefit of foreign currency translation on our sales million 
during fiscal  volumes grew by when compared to fiscal due principally to growth in china and other emerging regions  which more than offset weakness in north america 
these positive factors were partially offset by lower pricing million  principally from the feedstock related pricing mechanism in our rubber blacks supply contracts and a million unfavorable comparison from our transportation of carbon black feedstock cargo for a third party in fiscal that did not reoccur in fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal we announced our intention to close our waverly  west virginia carbon black manufacturing plant as a result of declining demand driven by weakness in the north american tire industry 
this facility ceased production during fiscal restructuring charges associated with the closure were recorded as part of our north american restructuring initiatives as certain items during fiscal and rubber blacks pbt increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal reduced manufacturing spending  the benefit of foreign currency translation and increased pricing more than offset a significant increase in raw material costs during the year 
the million increase in pbt in the rubber blacks business in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the positive impact million of pricing relative to our raw material costs  principally in our non contracted business  and higher volumes million 
these positive factors were partially offset by increased fixed costs from operating manufacturing units  principally in china and brazil  for the full year of fiscal that were not fully operational in fiscal generally  our rubber blacks supply contracts have provided for a price adjustment on the first day of each quarter to account for changes in feedstock costs and  in some cases  changes in other relevant costs 
the feedstock adjustments are based upon the average of a relevant index over a three month period 
because of the need to communicate these adjustments to our customers in a timely manner  the contracts typically provide for the adjustments to be calculated in the final month of the preceding quarter 
accordingly  the calculation is typically based upon the average of the three months preceding the month in which the calculation is made 
in periods of rapidly rising feedstock costs this time lag can have a significant unfavorable impact on the results of the rubber blacks business 
this was the case in fiscal when results were unfavorably affected by million  compared to an unfavorable million in fiscal we intend to reduce this time delay as contracts allow 
due to the timing of the expiration of contracts  our ability to effect this change will take place over the next months 
outlook for the global economic slowdown is likely to affect our results in fiscal we expect demand to remain weak in north america because of continued softness in the tire industry and we are experiencing significant slowing of demand in other parts of the world stemming from recent announcements of tire production curtailments 
we will curtail our own production as appropriate to meet demand requirements 
recent declines in feedstock costs will help our profitability and cash flows in the first half of fiscal we continue to invest in energy utilization technology and anticipate commissioning new units during fiscal  which should benefit our cost position 
supermetals business over the past several years  both sales and pbt in the supermetals business have been unfavorably impacted by the expiration of fixed volume  fixed price contracts  which has led to lower prices and volumes 
the last of these contracts expired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal causing an unfavorable sales and pbt comparison for fiscal sales in the supermetals business decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal and by million in fiscal compared to fiscal lower tantalum volumes unfavorably impacted sales by million and million when comparing fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal  respectively

during fiscal  lower costs positively impacted the business by million 
when comparing fiscal to fiscal  costs were lower by million 
in fiscal we made a lump sum payment of million to a supplier of tantalum ore to terminate a prior supply and other related agreements and entered into a new three year agreement  which ends in december higher ore costs resulting from this agreement impacted the business by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal and by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal outlook for the global economic slowdown is likely to adversely affect the supermetals business during fiscal as demand for our products is highly dependent upon the electronics industry 
however  price increases implemented during fiscal should begin to impact results during fiscal our existing long term raw material contract  which serves a portion of our needs  expires at the end of december while there can be no assurance as to availability of ore or its price in the future  given currently available sources and our current ore inventory levels  we believe we have an adequate supply of ore for the near term

during fiscal  volumes in the performance products business increased by and volumes in the fumed metal oxides business increased by when compared to fiscal fiscal pbt was million lower than fiscal driven principally by the impact million of higher raw material costs that could not be fully offset by increased pricing 
this included a million unfavorable lifo impact  of which the unfavorable cogs impact was million and the liquidation impact was a favorable million 
additionally  the business continued to invest in the development of differentiated products and geographic expansion resulting in increased selling  technical and administrative expenses 
these unfavorable factors could not be fully offset by the positive impact of higher volumes or the benefit of foreign currency translation 
the million increase in pbt in the performance segment in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was driven primarily by higher prices million  principally from feedstock related price increases in the performance products business  and higher volumes million driven by strong demand 

table of contents we continue to expand manufacturing capabilities for the performance segment  particularly in emerging markets 
during fiscal  we announced plans to build a masterbatch facility in dubai to serve increasing plastics demand in the middle east 
we also signed a joint venture agreement for the construction of a second fumed silica facility in china 
during fiscal  we completed the construction of a specialty carbon black manufacturing unit for the performance products business at our plant in tianjin  china with an annual nameplate capacity of approximately  metric tons 
the unit became operational in september during fiscal  we commissioned a new fumed silica manufacturing facility in jiangxi  china with an annual nameplate capacity of approximately  metric tons 
the unit became operational in june outlook for weaker global demand is likely to adversely affect us in fiscal as our performance segment is highly dependent upon the automotive  construction and electronics sectors 
we continue to invest in differentiated products and capacity expansion in emerging markets 
recent declines in feedstock costs will help our profitability and cash flows in the first half of fiscal new business segment sales and pbt for the new business segment for fiscal  and are as follows years ended september dollars in millions inkjet colorants business sales aerogel business sales superior micropowders sales segment sales segment pbt sales in the new business segment increased by million in fiscal  when compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales in the aerogel business and higher revenues in superior micropowders 
these increases were partially offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix in the inkjet colorants business 
the million decrease in sales in the new business segment in fiscal  when compared to fiscal was due principally to lower volumes in the inkjet colorants business and the transition from government to commercial revenues in superior micropowders 
the inkjet volume declines resulted from significant weakness in the aftermarket segment of the small office  home office inkjet market as aggressive competition from the oem cartridge manufacturers and improved ink efficiencies depressed demand in this market segment 
the loss in the new business segment grew slightly in fiscal when compared to fiscal higher volumes million were offset by an unfavorable product mix million  and slightly higher fixed costs in the aerogel business associated with production to fulfill orders for the oil and gas and construction market segment million 
the loss in pbt in the new business segment grew by million in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  driven primarily by lower volumes million due to softness in the inkjet aftermarket segment and the transition from government to commercial revenues in superior micropowders 
continued investment in our new businesses  an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact and higher raw material costs all unfavorably affected profitability and were only partially offset by lower fixed costs resulting from a temporary plant shutdown in the aerogel business during a portion of fiscal in  we entered into a cross license agreement with aspen aerogel  inc aspen where each party granted certain intellectual property rights to the other 
in consideration for the license of certain 
table of contents patents granted by cabot we are entitled to payments totaling million 
we received million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of installment payments which have been recorded in earnings 
the remaining million is payable in installments over the next five years  and will be recognized in earnings if and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
during the third quarter of fiscal we terminated work on under performing projects in the new business segment resulting in workforce reductions 
restructuring charges associated with these actions were recorded as part of our global restructuring initiatives as certain items during fiscal outlook for we continue to secure orders and partner with customers in our new businesses  which should lead to revenue growth within this segment during fiscal despite the slowing global economy 
the new business segment will also benefit from cost reduction actions taken during fiscal specialty fluids segment sales and pbt for the specialty fluids segment for fiscal  and are as follows years ended september dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt during fiscal  sales increased by million compared to fiscal driven by an increase in the number of jobs using our fluid 
a decrease in rental revenue between the two periods resulted in slightly lower pbt 
when comparing fiscal to fiscal  sales and pbt increased by million and million  respectively 
this increase was due to a larger number of wells using our fluid during the year 
we remain focused on expanding the usage of our fluids outside of the north sea as a key element of continued growth in this segment 
during fiscal  of sales in the specialty fluids segment was from regions outside of the north sea  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal outlook for we anticipate a slowing of drilling activity in the north sea during the coming to months driven by the timing of projects in this region 
however  as a result of our success in market development outside of the north sea during fiscal and  we are optimistic about the continued geographic expansion of the business 
cash flows and liquidity overview as of september   we had a substantial liquidity position  comprised of cash and ample availability under our committed credit facilities 
we had cash or cash equivalents of million  and current availability under our revolving and other credit facilities of approximately million 
while the availability of our credit facilities is dependent upon the financial viability of our lenders  we have no reason to believe that such liquidity will be unavailable or decreased 
our excess cash in the u 
s was invested in money market funds mmf throughout the fiscal year 
in september  however  due to the recent financial market turmoil  we withdrew our investments from mmfs and placed excess cash on deposit with our main cash management bank 
we had no material losses on our cash and marketable securities investments during fiscal all available cash is now on deposit with banking institutions that we believe to be financially sound 

table of contents we have also reviewed our derivative positions  which include interest rate swaps  cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts  from the perspective of counterparty risk and believe that we continue to transact with strong  creditworthy institutions 
looking forward to  we anticipate sufficient liquidity from cash flows and access to existing credit facilities to meet our operational needs and financial obligations 
our liquidity derived from cash flows is  to a large degree  predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  the cost of our raw materials and our ability to manage inventory levels 
while the recent turmoil in the financial markets has reduced the value of our pension assets  we believe that our investing strategies have been sufficiently prudent so as to not require any contributions to be made to our defined benefit plans in fiscal we may  however  elect to make a voluntary contribution to the plans during the year 
the following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our consolidated statements of cash flows  which appears in item of this report 
cash flows from operating activities cash generated by operating activities  which consists of net income adjusted for the various non cash items included in income  changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts  totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal included net income of million and non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization of million 
these sources of cash were offset by the use of cash to fund receivables and inventories 
specifically  we had a million increase in accounts receivable primarily attributable to feedstock related price increases and a million increase in inventories caused by higher carbon black feedstock costs 
this was in spite of our efforts to reduce inventory quantities during the course of the year 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million as a result of higher feedstock costs and the timing of raw material deliveries and payments 
the positive cash flow for fiscal was primarily generated from strong net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
there were no significant movements in working capital for the full year of fiscal as discussed above  during fiscal  our increase in working capital was primarily due to an escalation of carbon black feedstock costs 
while such increased costs are generally recovered through higher selling prices  there is a period of several months between the time when cash is paid for inventory purchases and when it is received from subsequent sales 
this leads to an increase in our cash requirements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  feedstock costs began to decline 
should this feedstock cost decline continue  we would anticipate that our cash position would be enhanced 
potential operating cash activities restructurings as of september   we had million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet related to the closure of our plant in waverly  west virginia and our global restructuring plan 
we made cash payments of million during fiscal related to restructuring costs 
we expect to make cash payments related to these restructuring activities of approximately million in fiscal repatriation of foreign currency as of september   we had cash denominated in bolivars at a venezuelan subsidiary of approximately million which has been translated at the official exchange rate 
we continue to be concerned about the amount that we will be able to receive when we repatriate some or all of this cash as we have not received approval to exchange the bolivars at the official rate 
if we are unable to repatriate this cash at the official exchange rate or if the official exchange rate devalues  we may incur additional reductions to our earnings and translated cash balances would be reduced 

table of contents environmental and litigation we have recorded a million reserve on a discounted basis million on an undiscounted basis as of september   for environmental remediation costs at various sites 
these sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years 
we anticipate that the expenditures at these sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
additionally  we have recorded a million reserve on a discounted basis million on an undiscounted basis for respirator claims as of september  this reserve for respirator claims was reduced during fiscal by approximately million based on an updated analysis of this exposure 
we also have other litigation costs associated with lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business including claims filed against us in connection with certain discontinued operations 
the following table represents the estimated future undiscounted payments related to our environmental and respirator reserves 
future payments by fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions environmental litigation respirator total employee benefit plans we provide defined benefit plans for all us and some foreign employees 
we have an unfunded status as of september  for consolidated defined benefit plans of million and postretirement benefit plans of million 
our us qualified defined benefit plan is overfunded by approximately million 
we currently believe  as indicated above and despite the recent turmoil in the financial markets  that we will not have any funding requirements relative to these plans in the near term  although we may elect to make voluntary contributions to the plans 
our postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
typical of such plans  our postretirement plans are unfunded 
we paid benefits under these plans of million in the us and less than million outside of the us during fiscal in order to limit our financial exposure  we established a per retiree cap in the us in on the amount we would contribute to retiree medical costs 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities consumed million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to an increase of million for capital spending on property  plant and equipment 
the increase in capital spending was partially offset by proceeds of million received from the sale of the land on which our altona  australia carbon black plant was located and by million related to the consolidation of one of our equity affiliates 
capital expenditures in fiscal included spending for rubber blacks capacity expansion at an existing facility in china  residual spending on our new performance products manufacturing unit in china and new energy centers at other rubber blacks facilities 
the energy centers use tail gas from the rubber blacks plant to produce steam or generate electricity that is either used in the plant or sold externally  offsetting utility costs 
capital expenditures in fiscal of million included the initial expenditures related to the construction of energy centers at three of our carbon black facilities and spending to complete the on going construction of our rubber blacks and performance products units in china 

table of contents capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million compared to million for fiscal our capital expenditure plan for fiscal includes completing the construction of four more energy centers  after which the percentage of our rubber blacks plants equipped with energy centers will increase from approximately to approximately 
during  we purchased million and received proceeds of million from short term investments  which were mainly auction rate securities that generally reset every twenty eight days even though their ultimate maturities were years and longer 
during fiscal  we ceased investing in auction rate securities 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities provided million in cash flows in fiscal compared to a use of million in fiscal in both years  financing cash flows were primarily driven by changes in our repurchases of our common stock  debt levels and dividend payments 
in particular  in fiscal our stock repurchases totaled million  compared to million in fiscal debt during fiscal  proceeds from long term debt provided million  partially offset by repayments of million  bringing our total long term debt to million as of september  this long term debt  of which million is current  matures at various times over the next nineteen years 
of this million  million was either issued as fixed interest rate debt or has been effectively converted to fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that change floating rates to fixed rates 
the weighted average interest rate on fixed rate long term debt is  including the effects of the interest rate swaps 
the remaining million of long term debt was issued as variable rate debt or was effectively swapped so as to create variable rate debt 
this includes million fixed to floating swaps on two medium term notes and a fixed to floating swap on million on a bond issued by one of our european subsidiaries 
the weighted average interest rate on variable interest rate long term debt is including the effects of the interest rate swaps and is based on the prevailing variable interest rates as of september  the current fair value of all the swaps is approximately million 
under our existing revolving credit facility we may borrow up to million 
the revolving line of credit permits us to borrow funds on an unsecured basis in multiple currencies that are freely tradable and convertible into us dollars at floating interest rates 
the credit facility expires in august as of september   we had outstanding borrowings of million  and million in standby letters of credit under this agreement 
the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility as of september  was approximately million 
the credit facility contains various affirmative  negative and financial covenants which are customary for financings of this type  including financial covenants for maximum indebtedness and  under certain conditions  minimum cash flow requirements 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants 
while the borrowings under our revolver are not due until  we will endeavor to begin to pay down such debt early if our operating cash flows prove sufficiently favorable 
at september   in addition to the million of standby letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility  we have provided standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling million  which expire in fiscal a downgrade of one level in our credit rating is not anticipated 
should it occur  however  it would not affect our ability to borrow money under our existing revolving credit facility but would affect the cost of this borrowing and we would be subject to one additional cash flow financial covenant 
in addition  we have million in committed facilities available to us at various locations throughout the world 

table of contents during fiscal  we entered into a five year loan facility for million rmb million that will be used to fund capital expenditures at our rubber blacks facility located in tianjin  china 
as of september   we had million rmb million outstanding under this facility 
during fiscal  proceeds from long term debt provided million  partially offset by repayments of million

additionally  we repurchased approximately  shares from employees who sold us shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for a cost of approximately million and approximately  forfeited shares under our equity incentive plans for a cost of approximately million 
dividend payments in fiscal  and  we paid cash dividends on our common stock of  and  respectively  per share of common stock 
these cash dividends payments totaled million  million and million in each of the respective years 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations which are described in greater detail in note r in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item payments due by fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions contractual obligations purchase commitments long term debt fixed interest on long term debt variable interest on long term debt operating leases total includes capital lease obligations of million over the years presented 
variable interest is based on the variable debt outstanding and prevailing variable interest rates as of september  includes the impact of interest rate swaps that either change fixed rates to floating rates or floating rates to fixed rates 
we are unable to estimate potential future payments related to pension obligations and uncertain tax positions 
purchase commitments we have long term  volume based purchase commitments for raw materials with various key suppliers in our core and performance segments 
operating leases we have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  and machinery and equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through long and short term borrowings and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of the derivative instruments we enter into are reviewed and approved by our financial risk management committee  an internal management committee responsible for overseeing cabot s financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by a quoted market price and reflects the asset or liability position as of september  if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a payment risk for cabot 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
as of september   the counterparties that we have 
table of contents executed derivatives with were rated between a and aa by standard and poor s 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
interest rate risk as of september   we had long term debt  including the current portion  totaling million  which has both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we endeavor to maintain a certain fixed to floating interest rate mix on our long term debt 
as most of our long term debt was issued at fixed rates  we use interest rate swaps to achieve the desired fixed to floating interest rate mix 
the table below summarizes the principal terms of our interest rate swap transactions  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction  and its fair market value at september  description notional amount receive pay fiscal year entered into maturity fiscal year fair market value at september  usd interest rate swaps fixed to variable usd million fixed us month libor usd million fixed us month libor usd million fixed us month libor million interest rate swaps variable to fixed jpy billion jpy month libor fixed 
table of contents foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations and government actions 
in general  we endeavor to match the currency in which we issue debt to the currency of our major  stable cash receipts 
in some situations we have issued debt denominated in us dollars and then entered into cross currency swaps that exchange our dollar principal and interest payments into a currency where we expect long term  stable cash receipts 
in one case  we have borrowed against our revolving credit facility in japanese yen 
this debt is designated as a net investment hedge to offset currency fluctuations associated with the investments we have made in our japanese subsidiaries 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our long term foreign currency swap transactions  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction and its fair market value at september  description notional amount receive pay fiscal year entered into maturity fiscal year fair market value at september  usd cross currency swaps usd million swapped to eur million fixed fixed million usd million swapped to eur million us month libor eur month libor million usd million swapped to jpy billion us month libor jpy month libor million foreign currency exposures also relate to current assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
these forward contracts typically have a duration of days 
in fiscal and fiscal  none of our forward contracts were designated as fas hedging instruments 
as of september   we had million in net foreign currency forward contracts  which were denominated in japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
in certain situations where we have a long term commitment denominated in a foreign currency we may enter into appropriate financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge future cash flow exposures
