item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
company overview casella waste systems  inc is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily in the eastern united states 
our company was founded in as a single truck operation in rutland  vermont and the business now operates in fourteen states 
we operate vertically integrated solid waste operations in vermont  new hampshire  new york  massachusetts  and maine  and stand alone materials processing facilities in pennsylvania  new jersey  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia  florida  michigan  and wisconsin 
as of may   the company owned and or operated solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities  eight subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber and a interest in a company that markets an incentive based recycling service 
operating results the company publicly announced its guidance for fiscal year and stated that results would be in the following approximate ranges assuming no growth in the regional economy  solid waste price growth of  with overall volumes down  positive price growth for fcr recycling  with flat volumes  and no major acquisitions revenues between million and million  capital expenditures between million and million  and free cash flow a non gaap measure between million and million 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported revenues of million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal year solid waste revenue growth  including the company s major account program  was year over year  with coming from price increases  primarily from our collection and transfer operations  and coming mainly from landfill and major accounts volume increases and increases in solid waste recycling commodity prices 
revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses  including tuck in hauling acquisitions in the central  western and north eastern regions and major accounts accounted for of the increase 
fcr recycling revenue growth was  with coming from commodity price increases and from higher volumes 
operating income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year operating results in fiscal years and were impacted by charges of million and million  respectively  associated with impairment charges and costs for the future closure of the hardwick landfill facility as well as the write off of certain deferred costs associated with projects determined to be no longer viable 
excluding these charges  operating margins were relatively consistent between years as total operating costs were relatively consistent with the higher levels of revenue 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were million  which was at the low end of our guidance 
free cash flow results for fiscal year exceeded the high end of our guidance and improved compared to fiscal year primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures 
our free cash flow for fiscal year and is calculated as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  net cash provided by operating activities   capital expenditures   other   free cash flow   free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure provided because certain investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of the solid waste industry  including us  and it assists investors in measuring our ability to meet capital expenditures  payments on operating lease contracts and working capital requirements 
free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities  which is the most comparable gaap financial measure 
attainment of our free cash flow target is also one of several metrics used in our incentive compensation calculations 
in fiscal year  the company acquired five solid waste hauling operations 
under the rules of purchase accounting  the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included from the date of acquisition and affect the period to period comparisons of the company s historical results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the assets of the holliston transfer station in the south eastern region for cash sale proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax was recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded the true up of certain contingent liabilities associated with the holliston transaction amounting to a gain of million net of tax recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the company s buffalo  ny transfer station  hauling operation and related equipment in the western region for proceeds of million including a note receivable for million and net cash proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company terminated its operation of mts environmental  a soils processing operation in the north eastern region 
a charge was recorded amounting to million associated with the abandonment 
included in this charge was the write off of the carrying value of assets along with costs associated with vacating the site 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
as of april   the company has deemed its fcr greenville operation as held for sale and has classified this as a discontinued operation pursuant to the requirements of sfas no the divestiture was completed in june and resulted in a small gain in fiscal year the operating results of these operations  including those related to prior years  have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
landfill accounting capitalized costs and amortization we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land and related airspace  permitting costs and preparation costs 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
the interest capitalization rate is based on the company s weighted average cost of indebtedness 
interest capitalized for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management routinely reviews its investment in operating landfills  transfer stations and other significant facilities to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and permittable capacity 
in determining estimated future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs  we consider the landfill costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
to be considered permittable  airspace must meet all of the following criteria we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
units of consumption amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by airspace surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our estimate of future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs as of april  decreased to million  compared to million as of april  and million as of april  the decrease in estimated future costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily as a result of work completed 
the decrease in estimated future costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily as a result of work completed  the closure of the hardwick facility and revised engineering estimates  partially offset by increases related to expansions planned at ontario and clinton county landfills 
remaining permitted and permittable airspace for the year ended april  was million tons compared to million tons as of april  the reduction of remaining airspace is primarily due to tons placed in fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in permittable airspace at the hakes construction and demolition landfill 
the planned expansions at ontario and clinton landfills is the primary reason for the increase in remaining permitted and permittable airspace to million tons as of april  compared to million tons as of april  landfill amortization expense for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
landfill amortization expense increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to higher expense at pinetree landfill  to reflect the shorter life of the site as agreed with the state of maine 
the site will now close in december landfill amortization expense increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal primarily due to the startup of the colebrook closure project in the central region and the true up of the brockton closure project in the south eastern region  partially offset by a decrease due to lower volumes at the worcester closure project 
landfill accounting capping  closure and post closure costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimates of costs to discharge capping  closure and post closure asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually for fiscal year and 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are discounted using the credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred and for fiscal year and respectively 
accretion expense is necessary to increase the accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities to the future anticipated obligation 
to accomplish this  we accrete our capping  closure and post closure accrual balances using the same credit adjusted  risk free rate that was used to calculate the recorded liability 
accretion expense on recorded landfill liabilities is recorded to cost of operations from the time the liability is recognized until the costs are paid 
accretion expense amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs was million as of april   compared to million as of april  and million as of april  we provide for the accrual and amortization of estimated future obligations for closure and post closure based on tonnage placed into each site 
with regards to capping  the liability is recognized and these costs are amortized based on the airspace related to the specific capping event 
accrued capping  closure and post closure costs include the current and non current portion of costs associated with obligations for capping  closure and post closure of our landfills 
the changes to accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  beginning balance  may   obligations incurred   revisions in estimates   accretion expense   payments   balance  april   the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to an increase in landfill volumes and higher average obligation rates 
the increase in fiscal year is primarily from capping  closure and post closure costs provided in conjunction with the closure of the hardwick landfill facility 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to payments made in conjunction with the closure of the hardwick landfill facility 
we estimate our future capping  closure and post closure costs in order to determine the capping  closure and post closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in note l to our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated timeframe for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill  as well as the duration of the post closure monitoring period 
based on our permitted and permittable airspace at april   we expect to make payments relative to capping  closure and post closure activities from fiscal year through fiscal year asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
in such circumstances an impairment loss would be recorded equal to the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we eliminated the amortization of goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment at each fiscal year end by applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each operating segment 
we estimate fair value based on net future cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the discounted future cash flows 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by reference to past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
we account for income tax uncertainties under fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance on the recognition  de recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associates with tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
evaluating and estimating our uncertain tax positions and tax benefits is based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
stock based compensation effective may  the we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  shared based payment sfas no 
r  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services using the modified prospective method 
under this method  all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the specified vesting period 
prior periods are not restated 
consistent with prior years we used the black scholes valuation model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation  including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company presented all tax benefits net of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit received by a company upon exercise of a nonqualified employee stock option 
sfas no 
r requires the company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense as a financing cash flow in its financial statements 
expected life is calculated based on the weighted average historical life of the vested stock options  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve for the period of the expected life of the stock option 
for fiscal year  expected volatility is calculated using the average of weekly historical volatility of the company s class a common stock over the last six years 
general revenues our revenues in our north eastern  south eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of our disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr and the central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
we also had a interest in the common stock of recyclerewards  inc recyclerewards a company that markets an incentive based recycling service 
in april  recyclebank completed an equity offering to third party investors that reduced the company s interest to 
effective april  the company accounts for its investment in recyclerewards under the cost method of accounting 
prior to april the company accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts 
our revenues are shown net of inter company eliminations 
we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentages and dollars of revenue attributable to services provided 
fiscal year ended april  collection    landfill disposal facilities   transfer    recycling    total revenues    collection and landfill disposal facilities revenues each decreased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  mainly because of the increase in recycling revenues due to higher commodity prices 
collection and transfer revenue dollars increased in fiscal year due to the positive impact of price and volume increases in the company s major accounts programs and in the north eastern region and the effect of tuck in acquisitions in the central  western and north eastern regions and within the major accounts program 
collection revenues as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year were lower compared to the prior year  mainly because of the increase in landfill and recycling revenues 
overall  the dollar increase in collection revenues year over year was due to the positive impact of acquisitions in the central  western and north eastern regions and price increases throughout the solid waste segment 
these increases were partially offset by lower collection volumes  with the most significant impact coming from the south eastern region 
the south eastern region collection volumes declined as a result of overall market declines in construction activity 
transfer volumes in the south eastern and central regions were also impacted by these market conditions  which mainly accounted for the decrease in transfer revenues in fiscal year compared to landfill disposal revenues increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to a full year s operation of both chemung landfill in the western region and the colebrook closure project in the central region 
landfill price increases came from the north eastern and western regions in fiscal year  however  the price increases were partially offset by lower volumes in the south eastern and north eastern regions 
recycling revenues are primarily from recycling facilities in the fcr segment and to a lesser extent from recycling facilities in the central and western regions 
the increase in recycling revenue dollars in fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and to a lesser extent an increase in volumes 
the increase in recycling revenue dollars for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and volumes from the company s existing facilities 
the increase in fiscal year was also due in part to a full year s operation of blue mountain recycling which included two recycling facilities and a small recyclable material transfer station 
operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  except for accretion expense  we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from our consolidated financial statements bear in relation to revenues 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of operations general and administration depreciation and amortization hardwick impairment and closing charges development project charges operating income interest expense  net loss income from equity method investments other income  net provision benefit for income taxes loss income from continuing operations before discontinued operations fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year solid waste revenues  including the company s major accounts program  increased million  with million coming from price increases  primarily from our collection and transfer operations  and million coming mainly from landfill and major accounts volume increases and increases in solid waste recycling commodity prices 
revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses  including tuck in hauling acquisitions in the central  western  north eastern regions and major accounts accounted for million of the increase 
fcr recycling revenue increased million mainly due to higher commodity prices 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal year from in the prior year  primarily due to an increase in the cost of purchased materials associated with higher fcr commodity prices as well as higher fuel costs  partially offset by lower direct operating costs and direct labor as well as property tax refunds 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due to higher levels of revenue as well as the company s focus on cost reduction programs in fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administrative costs was due primarily to higher compensation costs which include a million non recurring charge for recruiting  equity compensation and termination costs associated with the company s management reorganization  partially offset by lower bad debt allowances  communication and marketing expenses and legal and audit costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year landfill amortization expense increased by million primarily due to higher expense at pinetree  to reflect the shorter life of the site as agreed with the state of maine 
depreciation expense increased between periods by million due to capital additions 
amortization of other intangible assets decreased by million year over year as certain intangible assets were fully amortized during fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year hardwick impairment and closing charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company closed its hardwick landfill in the south eastern region following the defeat of a proposed amendment to the hardwick zoning bylaws and recorded an impairment charge of million which reflected the write off of the net book value of the facility along with closing charges of million in estimated future cash expenditures on capping  closure and post closure of the landfill 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a million charge associated with revised estimates for its future cash expenditures on capping  closure and post closure activities at the landfill 
development project charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal years and  the company wrote off million and million in deferred costs associated with certain development projects deemed no longer viable 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the north eastern region operating income declined as landfill amortization expense at pinetree increased year over year as discussed above 
the south eastern region operating income increased due to the impact in the prior year of the hardwick impairment and closing charge discussed above  partially offset by an increase in prior year revenue as a result of the true up of the brockton closure project and higher operating costs in the current year 
fcr s operating income increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year mainly due to higher prices and lower operating costs as a percentage of revenue year over year 
included in fcr operating income is million of income from the transactions involving the domestic brokerage and canadian recycling operations  as payments received on the notes receivable in fiscal year exceeded the balance of the net assets under contractual obligation 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase is attributable to higher debt levels  including the preferred shares which were redeemed in fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
in conjunction with the redemption  the company recorded accrued dividends for the fiscal year  in the amount of million  as interest expense 
net interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year loss income from equity method investments 
the loss from equity method investments in fiscal year relates to the company s joint venture interest in greenfiber and the company s interest in recyclerewards 
greenfiber reported a loss for fiscal year of which the company s share was million  compared to income of million in fiscal year greenfiber s revenue and income were down in fiscal year due to a slowdown in new home construction and higher fiber prices 
recyclerewards reported a loss for fiscal year  of which the company s share was million compared to a loss of million in fiscal year effective april  the company changed the accounting for its investment in recyclerewards from the equity method of accounting to the cost method of accounting as recyclerewards completed an equity offering to third party investors that reduced the company s interest to 
other income  net 
other income for fiscal year amounted to million compared to million in fiscal year other income in fiscal year includes million related to the reversal of residual accruals originally established in connection with waste handling agreement disputes between the company s maine energy subsidiary and fifteen municipalities which were party to the agreements 
on june   the company settled the last of these disputes with the city of saco and the city agreed to release the company from any further residual cancellation payment obligations 
also included in other income are dividends of million and million for fiscal years and respectively from our investment in evergreen national indemnity company evergreen 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes increased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased to in the year ended april  from in fiscal year the rate variance between the periods is due mainly to the low level of book income from operations  the add back of non deductible items  including non deductible losses related to recyclerewards  inc and preferred stock dividends recorded as interest expense 
loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the assets of the holliston transfer station in the south eastern region for cash sale proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax was recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded the true up of certain contingent liabilities associated with the holliston transaction amounting to a gain of million net of tax recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the company s buffalo  ny transfer station  hauling operation and related equipment in the western region for proceeds of million including a note receivable for million and net cash proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company terminated its operation of mts environmental  a soils processing operation in the north eastern region 
a charge was recorded amounting to million associated with the abandonment 
included in this charge was the write off of the carrying value of assets along with costs associated with vacating the site 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
as of april   the company has deemed its fcr greenville operation as held for sale and has classified this as a discontinued operation pursuant to the requirements of sfas no the divestiture was completed in june and resulted in a small gain in fiscal year the operating results of these operations  including those related to prior years  have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses accounted for million of the increase  including tuck in hauling acquisitions in the central  western and north eastern regions  a full year of a newly acquired landfill closure project in the central region  the acquisition of two recycling facilities and a small recyclable material transfer station in the fcr region and the new chemung contract to operate a landfill and transfer station in the western region 
the effect of acquisitions was partially offset by million as a result of the transfer of a canadian recycling operation to a former employee 
solid waste revenues  including the company s major accounts program  increased million due to higher prices  which accounted for million  partially offset by a decrease of million primarily due to lower volumes in the central  western and south eastern regions 
the south eastern region reductions in volume were partially offset by revenues from the true up of the brockton closure project 
excluding the rollover effect of acquisitions  fcr revenue increased million due to increases in commodity prices and volume 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year was  which was relatively flat compared to in fiscal year general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administration expenses was due primarily to higher compensation which includes the adoption of sfas no 
r  legal expenses  and bad debt allowances  partially offset by lower audit costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year depreciation expense increased by million between periods due to capital additions 
landfill amortization expense increased by million primarily due to the startup of the colebrook closure project in the central region and the true up of the brockton closure project in the south eastern region  partially offset by a decrease due to lower volumes at the worcester closure project 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year hardwick impairment and closing charge 
the hardwick landfill  which was acquired in march  located in hardwick  massachusetts  was closed following the defeat of a proposed amendment to the hardwick zoning bylaws at a hardwick town meeting held in january following such closure  the company reviewed its options available and efforts to overturn the adverse decisions of the town of hardwick and its zoning board of appeals  including the company s pending litigation and its efforts to effect a reconsideration of the adverse town meeting votes 
in connection with such review  the company assessed the likelihood of a successful outcome in relation to the expected costs of those efforts  and on the basis of the assessment the company decided to cease such efforts 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million which reflects the write off of the net book value of the facility along with closing charges of million in estimated future cash expenditures on capping  closure and post closure of the landfill 
development project charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company wrote off million in deferred costs associated with certain development projects deemed no longer viable 
due to the uncertainty regarding if and when the project will be restarted  a charge of million was recorded in fiscal year to write off the development costs incurred in pursuit of a contract to develop and operate the town of templeton  massachusetts sanitary landfill 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the margin decrease was primarily due to the impairment charge taken for the closure of the hardwick landfill facility and the write off of deferred acquisition costs as described above 
operating income for the solid waste regions was relatively flat as higher revenues were offset by higher operating costs  as described above 
fcr s operating income increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year mainly due to the effect of acquisitions  higher commodity prices and volumes 
interest expense  net

at the time of sale  there was no book value associated with these warrants as they had been previously written off 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes decreased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year due to the pre tax loss from continuing operations  the income tax benefit and the resulting effective tax rate for fiscal year decreased primarily due to certain state net operating losses for which the company is receiving no tax benefit 
in fiscal year when the company had pre tax income from continuing operations  the income tax provision and resulting effective tax rate were reduced primarily due to a decrease in the overall state tax rate and a decrease in the valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses

liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction  as well as site and cell closure 
our capital expenditures are broadly defined as pertaining to either growth or maintenance activities 
growth capital expenditures are defined as costs related to development of new airspace  permit expansions  new recycling contracts along with incremental costs of equipment and infrastructure added to further such activities 
growth capital expenditures include the cost of equipment added directly as a result of new business as well as expenditures associated with increasing infrastructure to increase throughput at transfer stations and recycling facilities 
growth capital expenditures also include those outlays associated with acquiring landfill operating leases  which do not meet the operating lease payment definition  but which were included as a commitment in the successful bid 
maintenance capital expenditures are defined as landfill cell construction costs not related to expansion airspace  costs for normal permit renewals and replacement costs for equipment due to age or obsolescence 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year growth capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years and respectively  and maintenance capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years and respectively 
capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to landfills as well as upgrades to equipment at various recycling facilities 
we expect capital spending to be between million and million in fiscal year we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  net working capital comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factor accounting for the increase in net working capital was the classification of the company s series a redeemable  convertible preferred shares as a current liability at april  as the company redeemed these in august also contributing to the increase were higher accounts receivable associated with higher revenue  higher deferred income taxes and lower other accrued liabilities 
offsetting these were higher accrued payroll and related expenses at april  on april   we entered into a senior credit facility with a group of banks for which bank of america is acting as agent 
the facility originally consisted of a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
on july   we amended the facility to increase the amount to million  and on may   we further amended the facility to increase the amount of the facility to million  including a million term b loan and a revolver of million 
this credit facility is secured by all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures april the initial borrowings under the credit facility were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the former credit facility 
further advances were available under the revolver in the amount of million and million as of april  and  respectively 
these available amounts are net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling million and million as of april  and  respectively 
as of april  and  no amounts had been drawn under the outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility agreement contains covenants that may limit our activities  including covenants that restrict dividends on common stock  limit capital expenditures  and set minimum net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we have historically entered into interest rate derivative agreements to balance fixed and floating rate debt interest risk in accordance with management s criteria 
the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments periodically over a specified term without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the agreements provide only for the exchange of interest on the notional amounts at the stated rates  with no multipliers or leverage 
differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt 
we terminated two interest rate swap agreements effective april  concurrent with entering into the new credit facility 
we received net proceeds of million which were amortized against interest expense over the original term of the swap contracts to february we are party to four separate interest rate swap agreements with four banks for a notional amount of million 
three agreements  for a notional amount of million  effectively fix the interest index rate on the entire notional amount at from may  through may  the remaining agreement for a notional amount of million effectively fixes the interest rate index at from november  through may  these agreements are specifically designated to interest payments under the company s term b loan and are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no

we are party to two separate interest rate zero cost collars with two banks for a notional amount of million 
the collars have an interest index rate cap of and an interest index rate floor of approximately and are effective from november  through may  these agreements are specifically designated to interest payments under the revolving credit facility and are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
as of april   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes which mature in january the senior subordinated note indenture contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
on december   we completed a million financing transaction involving the issuance by the finance authority of maine the authority of million aggregate principal amount of its solid waste disposal revenue bonds casella waste systems  inc project series the bonds 
the bonds are issued pursuant to an indenture  dated as of december  the indenture and are enhanced by an irrevocable  transferable direct pay letter of credit issued by bank of america  na pursuant to a financing agreement  dated as of december   by and between us and the authority  we have borrowed the proceeds of the bonds to pay for certain costs relating to landfill development and construction  vehicle  container and related equipment acquisition for solid waste collection and transportation services  improvements to existing solid waste disposal  hauling  transfer station and other facilities  other infrastructure improvements  and machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us  or a related party  all located in maine  and the issuance of the bonds 
on august   we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock  pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirements set forth in the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock 
the shares were redeemed at an aggregate redemption price of million  which was the liquidation value equal to the original price plus accrued but unpaid dividends through the date of redemption 
the redemption of the series a preferred stock was effected through cash payouts by us of the redemption price upon receipt of stock certificates and other related documentation from the holders thereof

net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years ended april  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
fiscal year net loss adjusted for impairment charge  loss on disposal of discontinued operations  loss from discontinued operations and development project charges totaled million 
this resulted in a decrease of million when compared to the fiscal year total of million 
higher depreciation and amortization in fiscal year versus fiscal resulted in a million increase 
landfill amortization expense increased by million primarily due to higher expense at pinetree  to reflect the shorter life of the site as agreed with the state of maine 
other increases are attributable to lower deferred taxes in fiscal year versus resulting in a million increase as well as loss income from equity method investments resulting in an increase if million for the same period 
changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures decreased million from fiscal year to fiscal year changes in accounts receivable amounted to a million increase in cash flows in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this is attributable to more effective receivable collections as evidenced by our days sales outstanding ratio which decreased to days at april  from days at april  the change in accounts payable during the fiscal year ended april  amounted to a decrease of million 
the decrease from the prior year period is primarily due to the timing of capital and other expenditures at april  versus april  changes in other assets and liabilities decreased million from the prior year due primarily to the following interest accruals amounted to a million decrease which is related to higher borrowings at april  versus april  and lower interest rates and the timing of borrowings in the current year  lower other long term liabilities at april  associated primarily with the maine energy settlement resulting in a million decrease  lower increases in accrued capping  closure and post closure costs in fiscal year versus fiscal year primarily due to fiscal year closure payments associated with hardwick landfill resulting in a million decrease  lower other accrued liabilities at april  primarily due to lower accruals associated with capital expenditures resulting in a million decrease  higher prepaid expenses at april  associated with the timing of various payments  amounting to a million decrease  offset by higher payroll accruals at april  associated with year end bonus accruals amounting to a million increase 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million used in investing activities in fiscal year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal year of million  lower investments in unconsolidated entities in fiscal year versus fiscal year amounting to million  offset by higher fiscal year payments on landfill operating lease contracts amounting to a million increase in cash used  higher acquisition activity in the current year amounting to million due primarily to the final earnout payment associated with blue mountain recycling  llc  the result of million in funds becoming available from escrow associated with the company s revenue bonds during fiscal year and lower proceeds from divestitures amounting to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to lower net borrowings to fund investing activities in the current period 
in fiscal year  we acquired five solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and in notes payable to seller 
we also made a final earnout payment of million to the members of blue mountain recycling  llc which was acquired in fiscal year in fiscal year  we acquired thirteen solid waste hauling operations for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash  million in notes payable and in other liabilities assumed 
for the landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow and our credit facility 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for landfill development  vehicles and containers  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures 
it is our intention to continue to grow organically and through acquisitions 
the funds to do so are expected to be obtained from operations and our credit facility which has an accordion feature for an additional million in credit availability based on the amendment completed on may  we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
we could from time to time issue securities thereunder in an amount of up to million 
however  our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt     capital lease obligations   interest obligations     operating leases     capping closure post closure    total contractual cash obligations    interest obligations based on long term debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year we believe that our cash provided internally from operations together with our senior secured credit facility should enable us to meet our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown
