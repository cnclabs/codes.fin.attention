overview energy services was formed on march   to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
it operated as a blank check company until august  at which time it completed the acquisitions of st pipeline  inc and c j hughes construction company  inc st pipeline and st hughes are considered predecessor companies to energy services 
the discussion of financial condition and operating results include the results of the two predecessors prior to the acquisition 
this discussion is based in part on pro forma income statement information 
the company acquired st pipeline for million in cash and million in a promissory note 
the c j hughes purchase price totalled million  one half of which was in cash and one half in energy services common stock 
the acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method and the financial results of both acquisitions are included in the results of energy services from the date of acquisition 
since the acquisitions  energy services has been engaged in one segment of operations which is the providing of contracting services for energy related companies 
currently energy services primarily services the gas  oil and electrical industries though it does some other incidental work 
for the gas industry  the company is primarily engaged in the construction  replacement and repair of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities for utility companies and private natural gas companies 
energy services is involved in the construction of both interstate and intrastate pipelines  with an emphasis on the latter 
for the oil industry the company provides a variety of services relating to pipeline  storage facilities and plant work 
for the electrical industry  the company provides a full range of electrical installations and repairs including substation and switchyard services  site preparation  packaged buildings  transformers and other ancillary work with regards thereto 
energy services other services include liquid pipeline construction  pump station construction  production facility construction  water and sewer pipeline installations  various maintenance and repair services and other services related to pipeline construction 
the majority of the company s customers are located in west virginia  virginia  ohio  kentucky and north carolina 
the company builds  but does not own  natural gas pipelines for its customers that are part of both interstate and intrastate pipeline systems that move natural gas from producing regions to consumption regions as well as building and replacing gas line services to individual customers of the various utility companies 
the company had consolidated operating revenues of million for the year ended september  of which was attributable to electrical customers  to natural gas customers  for the oil industry  for governmental entities and for all other customers 
energy services customers include many of the leading companies in the industries it serves  including marathon ashland petroleum llc  spectra energy  equitable resources  hitachi and nisource 
the company enters into various types of contracts  including competitive unit price  cost plus or time and materials basis and fixed price lump sum contracts 
the terms of the contracts will vary from job to job and customer to customer though most contracts are on the basis of either unit pricing in which the company agrees to do the work for a price per unit of work performed or for a fixed amount for the entire project 
most of the company s projects are completed within one year of the start of the work 
on occasion  the company s customers will require the posting of performance and or payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work performed 
the company generally recognizes revenue on unit price and cost plus contracts when units are completed or services are performed 
fixed price contracts usually results in recording revenues as work on the contract progresses on a percentage of completion basis 
under this accounting method  revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
many contacts also include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by the customer 
seasonality fluctuation of results our revenues and results of operations can and usually are subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are the result of weather  customer spending patterns  bidding seasons and holidays 
the first quarter of the calendar year is typically the lowest in terms of revenues because inclement weather conditions causes delays in production and customers usually do not plan large projects during that time 
while usually better than the first quarter  the second quarter often has some inclement weather which can cause delays in production  reducing the revenues the company receives and or increasing the production costs 
the third quarter usually is least impacted by weather and usually has the largest number of projects underway 
the fourth quarter is usually lower than the third due to the various holidays 
many projects are completed in the fourth quarter and revenues are often impacted by customers seeking to either spend their capital budget for the year or scale back projects due to capital budget overruns 
in addition to the fluctuations discussed above  the pipeline industry can be highly cyclical  reflecting variances in capital expenditures in proportion to energy price fluctuations 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by where our customers are in the cycle and thereby their financial condition as to their capital needs and access to capital to finance those needs 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or any other year 
you should read understanding gross margins and outlook below for discussions of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
understanding gross margins our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries  wages and some benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other equipment  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  portions of insurance  facilities expense  materials and parts and supplies 
various factors  some controllable  some not impact our gross margin on a quarterly or annual basis 
seasonal 
as discussed above  seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross margins 
usually  business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months 
weather 
adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margin in a given period 
periods of wet weather  snow or rainfall  as well severe temperature extremes can severely impact production and therefore negatively impact revenues and margins 
conversely  periods of dry weather with moderate temperatures can positively impact revenues and margins due to the opportunity for increased production and efficiencies 
revenue mix 
the mix of revenues between customer types and types of work for various customers will impact gross margins 
some projects will have more margins while others that are extremely competitive in bidding may have narrower margins 
service and maintenance versus installation 
in general  installation work has a higher gross margin than maintenance work 
this is due to the fact that installation work usually is more of a fixed price nature and therefore has higher risks involved 
accordingly  a higher portion of the revenue mix from installation work typically will result in higher margins 
subcontract work 
work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally has lower gross margins 
increases in subcontract work as a percentage of total revenues in a given period may contribute to a decrease in gross margin 
materials versus labor 
typically materials supplied on projects have smaller margins than labor 
accordingly  projects with a higher material cost in relation to the entire job will have a lower overall margin 
depreciation 
depreciation is included in our cost of revenue 
this is a common practice in our industry  but can make comparability to other companies difficult 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  communications  office and utility costs  professional fees  bad debt expense  letter of credit fees  general liability insurance and miscellaneous other expenses

this adjustment is to reflect the added interest cost that would have occurred relating to the notes issued to the shareholders of st pipeline had the transaction been in place for the respective periods st pipeline and cj hughes were both sub s corporations and therefore had no federal income taxes 
these entries are to reflect the estimated taxes for these companies had they been a part of energy services during the respective periods 
in accordance with the bylaws of energy services  shareholders had the right to vote against the transactions and request their shares be redeemed 
these entries reflect the lost interest income from the purchase of those shares so redeemed 
these entries are to reflect the tax savings related to the interest income lost on the payments to redeem shares 
compared to pro forma basis revenues 
revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues as the result of the added revenues from nitro electric which was acquired by cj hughes in may of and accordingly revenues were only included from that time forward 

cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended september  the driver of this increase was primarily the nitro electric acquisition by cj hughes in may of and the inclusion of that information from that time forward in gross profit 
gross profits for were million 
this was an increase of million or over the gross profit of million 
as explained above this was a result of nitro electric performance only being included from may of forward 
selling general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative increased by million to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of nitro electric by cj hughes and the inclusion of nitro performance from that time forward 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million or to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this is a function of the previous categories 
interest income 
interest income was about even with the prior year at  for and  for interest expense interest expense increased by  to million at september  this increase was driven primarily by added borrowings on lines of credit and for equipment purchases 
other income 
other income increased by  to million for the year ended september  over the amount of  this increase was driven by the rental of equipment to outside parties 
net income 
net income increased by million or to million for the year ended september  from a net income of million for the year ended september  the increase occurred due to the various changes as previously discussed 
for energy services energy services for had sales of million  a net income of million which resulted in earnings per share of basic and fully diluted 
these results included results from the acquired companies from august  through september  the results also included million in interest income from the trust fund which was disbursed as discussed in the financial conditions section 
comparison of financial condition the company had total assets at september  of million 
some of the primary components of the balance sheet were accounts receivable which totaled million up million from the prior year balances of the operating companies 
other major categories of assets at september  included cash of million and fixed assets of million 
liabilities totaled million up million from this increase was primarily due to borrowings to fund the purchase of fixed assets 
at the end of  the company had million of funds in a trust account being held for the completion of acquisitions totaling at least of the funds 
that balance grew to million by august  upon completion of the st pipeline and cj hughes acquisitions on august   the company disbursed those funds with million in cash going to the acquired companies shareholders  million to redeem those energy services shareholders electing redemption  million to pay the underwriting deferred fee and the remaining million to the company to be used for general corporate purposes 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity rose from million at september  to million at september  due to a combination of the additional shares issued with regards to the c 
j 
hughes acquisition and the net income for the year 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  which totaled million along with our credit facilities available to us and our anticipated future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient cash to meet our operating needs 
however  with the current energy shortage nationwide and the increased demand for our services  we could be faced with needing significant additional working capital 
also  current general credit tightening resulting from the general banking and other economic contraction that has occurred in the second half of  has impaired the availability of credit facilities for future operational needs 
a prolonged restriction in borrowing capacity may limit the growth ability of the company 
sources and uses of cash as of september   we had million in cash  working capital of million and long term debt net of current maturities of million 
the maturities of the total long term debt is as follows off balance sheet transactions due to the nature of our industry  we often enter into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
though for the most part not material in nature  some of these are leases our work often requires us to lease various facilities  equipment and vehicles 
these leases usually are short term in nature  one year or less though at times we may enter into longer term leases when warranted 
by leasing equipment  vehicles and facilities  we are able to reduce are capital outlay requirements for equipment vehicles and facilities that we may only need for short periods of time 
the company currently rents two pieces of real estate from stockholders directors of the company under long term lease agreements 
the one agreement calls for monthly rental payments of  and extends through january  the second agreement is for the company s headquarter offices and is rented from a corporation in which two of the company s directors are shareholders 
the agreement began november  and runs through with options to renew past that 
it calls for a monthly rental of  per month 
letters of credit certain of our customers or vendors may require letters of credit to secure payments that the vendors are making on our behalf or to secure payments to subcontractors  vendors  etc 
on various customer projects 
at september   the company was contingently liable on an irrevocable letter of credit for  to guarantee payments of insurance premiums to the group captive insurance company through which the company obtains its general liability insurance 
performance bonds some customers  particularly new ones or governmental agencies require us to post bid bonds  performance bonds and payment bonds 
these bonds are obtained through insurance carriers and guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the insurer make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the insurer for any expenses or outlays it is required to make 
depending upon the size and conditions of a particular contract  we may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the insurer 
posting of these letters or other collateral will reduce our borrowing capabilities 
historically  the company has never had a payment made by an insurer under these circumstances and do not anticipate any claims in the foreseeable future 
at september   we had million bonds issued by the insurer outstanding 
concentration of credit risk in the ordinary course of business the company grants credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include natural gas and oil companies  general contractors  and various commercial and industrial customers located within the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to business and economic factors that would affect these companies 
however  we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided 
under certain circumstances such as foreclosure  we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables 
the company had only two customers that exceeded ten percent of revenues for the year ended september  this was equitable resources and spectra which accounted for of revenues 
litigation the company is a party from time to time to various lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions typically seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personally injury  breach of contract and or property damages  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims  and proceedings  we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these proceedings  separately or in aggregate  would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
related party transactions in the normal course of business  we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties 
these transactions typically would not be material in nature and would usually would relate to real estate  vehicle or equipment rentals 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation during the years ended september  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes methods used to measure fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal periods  as it relates to financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value 
sfas no 
also requires certain tabular disclosures related to results of applying sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities based on the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet as of september   we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  based on the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet as of september   we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is prohibited 
assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations which occurred prior to the adoption of fasb no 
r should not be adjusted upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination  establishes the acquisition date as the measurement date to determine the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
as it relates to recognizing all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  costs an acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur in the future to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate or relocate an acquiree s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date but must be expensed in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  during the measurement period  which should not exceed one year from the acquisiton date  any adjustments that are needed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of that date will be adjusted retrospectively 
the acquirer will be required to expense all acquisition related costs in the periods such costs are incurred other than costs to issue debt or equity securities 
sfas no 
r will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption  but it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future when it is applied to acquisitions which occur in the fiscal year beginning october  in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
the intent of fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure its fair value and to enhance existing disclosure requirements relating to intangible assets 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  we will adopt fsp on october  we do not expect fsp to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption  but it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on our pro forma consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under a fixed price contract 
revenue from fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
such contracts generally provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered  measured typically in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
contract costs typically include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
costs 
provisions for the total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
self insurance the company is insured at one subsidiary for general liability insurance through a captive insurance company 
while the company believes that this arrangement has been very beneficial in reducing and stabilizing insurance costs  the company does have to maintain a letter of credit to guarantee payments of premiums 
should the captive experience severe losses over an extended period  it could have a detrimental affect on the company 
current and non current accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates relating to  among others  our customer s access to capital  our customer s willingness or ability to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer 
while most of our customers are large well capitalized companies  should they experience material changes in their revenues and cash flows or incur other difficulties and not be able to pay the amounts owed  this could cause reduced cash flows and losses in excess of our current reserves 
at september   the management review deemed that the allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate to cover any anticipated losses 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
recently our customers have been experiencing high demand for their products  particularly natural gas 
accordingly  we normally would expect to see projected spending for our customers on their transmission and distribution systems increasing dramatically over the next few years 
however  with the current uncertainty in the economy the demand for the customer s project could wane and also their ability to fund planned projects could be reduced 
the company s backlog at september  was million and while adding additional business projects appears likely  no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in bidding on projects that become available 
moreover  even if the company obtains contracts  there can be no guarantee that the projects will go forward if the current economic instability continues 
if the increased demand experienced in fiscal continues  we believe that the company will continue to have opportunities to continue to improve both revenue volumes and the margins thereon 
however  as noted above  if the current economic conditions persist  growth could be limited 
if growth continues  we will be required to make additional capital expenditures for equipment to keep up with that need 
currently  it is anticipated that in fiscal  the company s needed capital expenditures will be between and million dollars 
however  if the customer demands continue to grow  this number could change dramatically 
significantly higher capital expenditure requirements could of course put a strain on the company s cash flows and require additional borrowings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to increases in fuel prices and adverse changes in interest rates  as discussed below 
interest rate 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our borrowings from banks 
some of our loans have variable interest rates 
accordingly  as rates rise  our interest cost would rise 
we do not feel that this risk is significant
