overview we are a leading provider of advanced automated fingerprint identification systems  afis  and other fingerprint biometrics solutions to governments  law enforcement agencies and other organizations worldwide 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in we have been researching  designing  developing and marketing afis and other fingerprint biometrics solutions since inception 
during most of our operating history  we have achieved positive income and cash flows from operations 
from the fourth quarter of through the year ended december   we experienced significant increases in our revenues and net income as the market for our afis solutions expanded primarily due to increased demand by the department of homeland security  or dhs  as well as the national electoral council of venezuela  or cne 
we experienced a decline in revenues during the year ended december  due to the completion of a number of significant contracts  the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts entered into in previous periods and slowdowns in the procurement process at the us government 
in our revenues improved over levels as we recorded revenue from an increased number of customers 
we believe that we are positioned to experience an increase in revenues in over levels as we expect to recognize revenue from previously announced contracts with customers including morocco  spain  maryland  hong kong  egypt and the dhs  as well as from new contracts with core customers such as the dhs  the county of los angeles and various programs in europe 

table of contents sources of revenues we generate product revenues principally from sales of our afis solutions  which typically consist of our programmable matching accelerator  pma  servers and other afis equipment  including workstations and live scans  bundled with our proprietary software 
also included in product revenues are fees generated from design and deployment of our afis solutions 
we generate maintenance revenues from maintenance contracts that are typically included with the sale of our afis solutions 
maintenance contracts for technical support and software updates generally cover a period of one year  and after contract expiration  our customers have the right to purchase maintenance contract renewals  which generally cover a period of one year 
revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the maintenance obligation 
we generate services revenues from engineering services and afis system operation services that are not an element of an arrangement for the sale of products 
these services are typically performed under fixed price and time and material agreements 
we market our solutions primarily to us and foreign government agencies and law enforcement agencies 
in a typical contract with a government agency for an initial afis deployment  we agree to design the afis  supply and install equipment and software and integrate the afis within the agency s existing network infrastructure 
these initial deployment contracts frequently require significant modification or customization of our solution as part of our integration services 
these contracts provide for billings up to a fixed price total contract value upon completion of agreed milestones or deliveries  with each milestone or delivery typically having a value specified in the contract 
these customers usually impose specific performance and acceptance criteria that must be satisfied prior to invoicing for each milestone or delivery 
when customers purchase afis solutions that do not require significant modification or customization of our software  whether as an initial deployment or as an expansion of an existing afis  we typically agree to deliver the products and perform limited installation services subject to customer specific acceptance criteria 
certain of our customers  including the dhs  submit purchase orders under blanket purchase order agreements 
blanket purchase order agreements set out the basic terms and conditions of our arrangement with the customer and simplify the procedures for ordering our products to avoid administrative processes that would otherwise apply  particularly with the federal government 
the billing of these contracts is generally tied to delivery and acceptance of specific afis equipment  usually our pma servers or live scans 
most of our contracts for afis solutions also include an ongoing maintenance obligation that we honor over a term specified in the deployment contract or the blanket purchase order agreement 
the nature of our business and our customer base is such that we negotiate a set of unique terms for each contract that are based upon the purchaser s standard form of documentation 
the most significant portion of our revenues since the fourth quarter of has arisen from increased demand by the dhs and the cne for our afis solutions 
the dhs uses our solutions in connection with the implementation of the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology  or us visit  program  and the cne uses our solutions for national  regional and local elections 
we anticipate that the dhs will account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our most recent arrangement with the cne was completed in december and revenues from all of our arrangements with the cne were fully recognized by june  we do not have any long term contracts with any of our customers  including the dhs  for the sale of our products  and our future sales will depend upon the receipt of new orders 
any delay or other change in the rollout of us visit or any failure to obtain new orders from the dhs could cause our revenues to fall short of our expectations 
we also expect to experience continued demand from a number of other governments as they deploy afis solutions in elections  at points of entry and exit  including borders  seaports and airports  and in connection with national identification programs 
for example  in canada  we have been awarded an initial contract and several follow on orders  and we believe we may receive additional follow on orders related to the royal canadian mounted police rcmp s real time identification initiative 
another example is our september contract with the direction g n rale de la suret nationale of morocco dgsn to provide an integrated turn key afis 
the quantity and timing of orders from both us and foreign government entities depends on a number of 
table of contents factors outside of our control  such as the level and timing of budget appropriations 
government contracts for security solutions in elections  at points of entry and exit and in connection with national identification programs are typically awarded in open competitive bidding processes 
therefore  our future level of sales of afis solutions for deployments in elections and at points of entry and exit may vary substantially  and will depend on our ability to successfully compete for this business 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues consists principally of compensation costs incurred in designing  integrating  installing and customizing afis solutions  the costs associated with manufacturing  assembling and testing our afis solutions and utilizing subcontractors 
a substantial portion of these costs represents components  such as servers  integrated circuits  workstations  live scans and other hardware 
cost of product revenues also includes related overhead  compensation  final assembly  quality assurance  inventory management  support costs and payments to contract manufacturers that perform assembly functions 
cost of maintenance and services revenues consists of customer support costs and training and professional service expenses  including compensation 
cost of revenues also includes share based compensation allocable to personnel performing services related to cost of revenues 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors  including our mix of products and the amount of third party hardware included in our afis solutions 
other factors that may affect our gross margin include changes in selling prices of our products  maintenance and services  fluctuations in demand for our products  the timing and size of customer orders  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  changes in costs of components and new product introductions by us and our competitors and agreements entered into with our subcontractors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  depreciation of development and test equipment  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products  and the cost of computer support services 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
under our customer contracts  we typically obtain the rights to use any improvements to our technology developed on a particular customer deployment on other customer deployments 
as a result  we have historically been able to moderate our research and development expenses by leveraging the improvements developed by our personnel working on customer engagements 
research and development expenses also include share based compensation allocable to personnel performing services related to research and development 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  public relations and advertising  along with promotional and trade show costs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses also include share based compensation allocable to personnel performing services related to sales and marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in finance  human resources  insurance  information technology  administrative activities and legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses also include share based compensation allocable to personnel performing general and administrative services 
in april  we initiated a lawsuit against northrop grumman northrop based on claims of breach of contract  conversion  misappropriation of trade secrets  breach of trust  interference with prospective economic advantage  breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing  and unfair competition the action 
in december  we and northrop entered into a definitive settlement agreement and mutual release of claims  which was effective as of september   pursuant to which we and northrop formally settled and released all claims and causes of action alleged in the action 
in the year ended december  we incurred million in legal fees relating to the action 
no revenue or other income was recognized from the settlement agreement in we have not yet determined the accounting treatment including the income statement classification of amounts to be received under the settlement agreement 

table of contents application of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to percentage of completion  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  commitments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition  commitments and contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments in marketable securities  accounting for taxes  and accounting for share based compensation 
revenue recognition 
because our proprietary software is essential to the functionality of our afis solutions and other biometrics products  we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  we apply the provisions of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
to the extent an element within our software arrangements falls within a level of accounting literature that is higher than sop  we record revenue on such element in accordance with the relevant authoritative literature 
for arrangements that contain the lease of equipment  we account for the lease element in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases and account for the remaining elements in the arrangement in accordance with sop for arrangements that contain a non software deliverable such as hardware  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for multiple element arrangements not subject to accounting under sop  we account for these arrangements in accordance with eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale includes systems  software and services or a combination of these items 
as our business evolves  the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized 
additionally  revenue recognition involves judgments  including estimates of costs to complete contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting and assessments of the likelihood of nonpayment 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience and market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 

table of contents product revenues the timing of product revenues recognition is dependent on the nature of the product sold 
revenues associated with afis solutions that do not require significant modification or customization of our software  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance for which we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  are recognized upon installation and receipt of written acceptance of the solution by the customer when required by the provisions of the contract  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
for example  we recognize revenue in this manner from sales of our pma servers to the dhs under our blanket purchase agreement with the dhs 
revenue resulting from arrangements for which vsoe of the maintenance element does not exist is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues associated with afis solutions that require significant modification or customization of our software  are recognized using the percentage of completion method as described by sop the percentage of completion method reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue which has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor effort expended to date to the anticipated final labor effort  based on current estimates of total labor effort necessary to complete the project 
the amount subject to the percentage of completion method is exclusive of the maintenance  the fair value of which is established by vsoe 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual results differ from our judgments and estimates 
we recognize revenue in this manner from sales of significant initial afis deployments 
revenue resulting from arrangements for which vsoe of the maintenance element does not exist is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period or until the time when such vsoe is established 
revenues recognized under such arrangements were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue associated with the sale of our application specific integrated circuit  or asic applications  stand alone live scans and other biometric products  excluding maintenance when applicable  is recognized upon shipment to the customer provided i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii title and risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collection is deemed probable 
revenue associated with service offerings where we maintain and operate a portion of the afis systems on an outsourced application hosting basis is recognized on a per transaction basis provided i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii title and risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collection is deemed probable 
revenue associated with contracts where sufficient vsoe cannot be established for the allocation of revenue to the various elements of the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which i such sufficient vsoe does exist or ii all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
cash received from customers in advance of recognition of the related revenue is recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance revenues maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software updates on a when and if available basis 
we recognize all maintenance revenue ratably over the applicable maintenance period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to substantive maintenance renewal provisions contained in a particular arrangement or  in the absence of such renewal provisions  through reference to vsoe of maintenance renewal rates 
we consider substantive maintenance provisions to be provisions where the stated maintenance renewal as a percentage of the product fee is comparable to our normal pricing for maintenance only renewals 
in the event that maintenance included in an afis solutions contract does not have vsoe  the entire arrangement fee  including the contractual amount of the maintenance obligation  is included in product revenues and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 

table of contents services revenues professional services revenue is primarily derived from engineering services and afis system operation and maintenance services that are not an element of an arrangement for the sale of products 
these services are generally billed on a time and materials basis 
the majority of our professional services are performed either directly or indirectly for us government organizations 
revenue from such services is recognized as the services are provided 
consistent with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the amount of revenue recognized from commissions where we are acting as an agent is the net amount after payments are made to the primary obligor responsible for delivering the services 
revenue recognition criteria we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the element has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use either contracts signed by both the customer and us or written purchase orders issued by the customer that legally bind us and the customer as evidence of an arrangement 
product delivery we deem delivery to have occurred when afis solutions are installed and  when required under the terms of a particular arrangement  upon acceptance by the customer 
shipments of our asics  stand alone live scans and other biometric products are recognized as revenue when shipped and title and risk of ownership has passed to the buyer 
fixed or determinable fee for product arrangements not accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue balance results primarily from payments received from customers in advance of recognition of the related revenue and  to a lesser extent  from invoicing of customers prior to recognition of the related revenue 
certain customers make upfront payments resulting in cash collected prior to our recognition of revenue 
these payments can be significant 
we record this upfront payment as deferred revenue and reduce the deferred revenue balance as revenue is recognized 
as a result  our deferred revenue balance fluctuates from quarter to quarter because it is a function of the timing of i the receipt of cash payments from those customers who pay in advance of revenue recognition  ii invoicing of customers in advance of revenue recognition and iii amortization of deferred revenues into revenues 
deferred revenues also consist of payments received in advance from our customers for maintenance agreements  under which revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
however  the fluctuation in the deferred revenue balance from quarter to quarter is generally not significantly affected by the deferred maintenance revenue 
because the mix of customers who pay or are invoiced in advance of revenue recognition changes from period to period  fluctuations in our deferred revenue balance are not a reliable indicator of total revenue to be recognized in any future period 
our cash flow from operations is also affected each quarter as a result of fluctuations in the deferred revenue balance 
commitments and contingencies 
we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies and commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or 
table of contents probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  then such loss is accrued and charged to operations 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to sfas no 
are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we will disclose the nature of the contingency and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  through consideration of the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
investments in marketable securities 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of money market funds  certificates of deposit and commercial paper  us treasury securities  government sponsored enterprise securities  municipal bonds  foreign government bonds and corporate bonds and notes 
we account for our investments in debt and equity securities under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fas 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as other comprehensive income loss  respectively 
under fas  unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income oci as a separate component of shareholders equity 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we evaluate the investment in accordance with fasb staff position fsp and the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its applications to certain investments which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
among other things  we consider the duration and extent of the decline and economic factors influencing the markets 
if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written off to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings that is  accounted for as a realized loss 
the new cost basis is not to be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
subsequent increases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in oci  subsequent decreases in fair value  if not an other than temporary impairment  also are included in oci 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and may have a material impact on our results of operations 
as of december   our investments included million of auction rate securities 
these investments have high credit quality ratings of aa or aaa and are fully collateralized by bonds and other financial instruments 
auction rate securities are generally long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
we generally invest in these securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
accordingly  the investments are typically classified as current and available for sale investments and included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent to december   we liquidated million of our auction rate securities in successful auctions and purchased additional auction rate securities valued at million 
as of february   we held million in auction rate securities 
recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other 
table of contents investors from liquidating investments in auction rate securities because  in recent auctions  the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
we are not certain as to when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve 
as a result of the timing of the recent auction failures beginning in february  we are uncertain as to the current fair market value of the auction rate securities we hold 
based on the fair market value of the auction rate securities and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  including  but not limited to  whether the credit ratings of the issuers or the insurers deteriorate  or the collateral of the securities deteriorates  we may be required to reflect a write down of certain of our auction rate securities in the first quarter of as a charge to earnings if any of our auction rate securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
such impairment charge would be recorded as other expense and could be material to our results of operations 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the potential lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
accounting for taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets were million 
management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to make or adjust valuation allowances with respect to our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with foreign government agencies 
each country with which we do business has its own particular rules to determine the point at which our activities within such country will become subject to taxes  if any 
to the extent our contracts with foreign government agencies are subject to income taxes and we do not generate adequate foreign tax credits for purposes of our federal income tax return  our effective tax rate may be impacted 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently  affect our operating results 
accounting for share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized includes a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each of our stock option awards  which is 
table of contents estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the fair value of our stock option awards is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded day to day options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of income data for each of the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues product revenues maintenance and services revenues total revenues cost of revenues cost of product revenues cost of maintenance and services revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income income before income taxes income tax provision net income comparison of results for the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  product revenues were consistent at million for the year ended 
table of contents december  and million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   product revenues were affected by an aggregate increase of million in revenues from the dhs and its logistical partners  the rcmp  the dgsn  the ukvisas project and the attorney general of ohio  as well as a million decrease in product revenues from the cne  primarily due to the completion of contracts under which we provided afis solutions to the cne 
maintenance and services revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of million or was due to an increase in maintenance renewals and engineering services associated with product sales in prior periods  as well as revenues earned under our recent arrangement to operate and maintain an afis used to obtain  transmit  and match finger images for applicants and recipients of food stamp benefits in the state of texas 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of the prior year 
product gross margins were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the improvement in margins on product revenues was primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold during during we recognized a significant portion of our revenues from provision of hardware intensive afis solutions  which typically have lower margins 
a larger portion of our revenues represented software intensive solutions which typically carry higher margins 
costs of maintenance and service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  maintenance and services gross margins decreased from in to in the increase in costs of maintenance and services was primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in providing maintenance and engineering services from at december  to at december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenues for the year ended december  the increase of million or was primarily due to an increase in salary expense and other labor related costs driven by an increase in research and development headcount 
our research and development related headcount increased to as of december  from as of december  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million or of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million or was primarily due to an increase in salary expenses and other labor related costs of  driven by an increase in headcount from at december  to at december  in anticipation of a general increase in the number and size of contracts coming up for proposal in the biometric security industry  management instituted an effort to expand its marketing and business development capabilities during this effort included an expansion in our selling and marketing related headcount  including the hiring of several key executives in the us  canada and the us an increase in consulting fees of  to support business development and proposal activities  also contributed to the increase in selling and marketing expenses during the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the million or increase was due to a million increase in legal fees related to our lawsuit against northrop grumman 
legal fees incurred in connection with the company s legal action against northrop grumman were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents interest income 
we earned interest income of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in interest income of million or was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher cash and investment balances as a result cash generated from operations 
income tax provision 
we recognized an income tax provision of million during the year ended december  as a result of the net income earned in the period 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended december  represents federal  state and foreign taxes on our income reduced primarily as a result of benefits resulting from the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and by federal and state research and development credits 
we recognized an income tax provision of million  with an effective tax rate of  during the year ended december  as a result of the net income earned in the period 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended december  represents federal  state and foreign taxes on our income reduced primarily as a result of benefits resulting from the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and by research and development credits 
the increase in the effective tax rate from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  is primarily due to the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a significant decrease in our research and development tax credits coupled with the income tax related interest and penalties of  recorded during the year ended december  in accordance with fin comparison of results for the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  product revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in product revenues resulted primarily from decreases of million and million in revenues generated from the dhs and the cne  respectively

sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk although we generally bill for our products and services mostly in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our vendors in us dollars 
in the future  an increased portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk
