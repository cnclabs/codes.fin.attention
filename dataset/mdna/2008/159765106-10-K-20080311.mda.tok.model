item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item of this report for information regarding our total assets  revenue from operations and net income 
moissanite moissanite is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors 
naturally occurring moissanite crystals are scarce  generally very small in size  dark green or black in color and are not a commercially viable gemstone material 
therefore  we expect only lab grown sic crystals to provide a meaningful source of moissanite for jewels 
it is generally accepted that  in addition to carat size  the most important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty  durability and rarity 
the beauty of a gemstone is characterized by its color  brilliance  dispersion fire  and luster 
the brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index  or the extent  when coupled with the facet design  to which the gemstone reflects light 
the fire of a gemstone  or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors  is measured by its dispersion 
luster is the amount of light that is reflected back to the observer from the surface of a gemstone 
the durability of a gemstone is determined by its hardness  or resistance to scratching  and its toughness  or resistance to chipping or cleaving 
the gemstone s hardness also determines the extent to which brilliance and fire can be highlighted by cutting the gemstone with sharp  well defined and highly polished facets 
rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone 
moissanite jewels have unique fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
the refractive index and the fire of moissanite jewels are higher than those found in other gemstones 
we believe that the hardness of moissanite jewels is greater than all known gemstone materials except diamond 
as a result  moissanite jewels  like diamond  can be cut with sharp  well defined and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire 
the cutting specifications facet arrangement and proportions for moissanite jewels are designed to maximize the brilliance and fire inherent in the material 
additionally  we evaluate the finished jewels to exacting standards with automated video imaging equipment and specially trained quality control personnel 
due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of jewel quality moissanite  we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels 
in addition  there are other physical properties of moissanite jewels that compare favorably to fine gemstones  which we believe will aid in jewelers acceptance of charles colvard created moissanite 

table of contents moissanite jewels  like diamond  can withstand high temperatures  which allow jewelers to make extensive repairs to the jewelry setting without removing the jewel 
jewelers can therefore use similar basic methods that are commonly used to repair diamond jewelry 
because of its unique atomic structure  moissanite can be grown in a variety of colors including blue  green or yellow 
additionally  although none have been produced to date  the colors red and pink are theoretically possible to grow 
to date  we have focused our development  manufacturing and distribution efforts on the colorless form of moissanite  although we have sold limited quantities of green moissanite

the mohs scale is a relative scale only  and quantitative comparisons of different gemstone materials cannot be made directly using the mohs scale 
moissanite jewels are approximately one half to one third as hard as diamond 
with the exception of the moissanite a new synthetic gemstone material and synthetic moissanite a new diamond substitute articles  the physical properties of moissanite jewels set forth in the preceding table utilized materials from sic crystals produced by parties other than cree or us 
these crystals had various sizes  colors and atomic structures that we believe made them unsuitable for use as a gemstone 
we have conducted tests on the hardness  toughness and refractive index of samples of charles colvard created moissanite  and the results of these tests are consistent with the results reported in this table 
products and product development moissanite jewels 
we primarily sell near colorless moissanite jewels cut in a variety of shapes including round  square brilliant  radiant  cushion  oval  marquise  pear  baguette  rose  and heart in sizes ranging from to mm approximately to carats 
we distribute a limited quantity of green moissanite jewels to evaluate the market potential of colored moissanite 
we may elect to offer  from time to time  additional cuts  sizes and colors of moissanite jewels 

table of contents during  we purchased approximately million of raw materials 
to accommodate our need for additional inventory of selected shapes and sizes and to support anticipated growth  raw material purchases increased to approximately million and million in and  respectively 
our growth has not expanded as fast as we anticipated and we reduced raw material purchases to million in we expect to further reduce raw material purchases in as discussed in more detail below  we expect total purchases during to be approximately million  with million purchased from cree and million purchased from norstel 
amended and restated exclusive supply agreement with cree 
in june  we entered into an amended and restated exclusive supply agreement exclusive supply agreement with cree pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase from cree at least  by dollar volume  of our sic crystal requirements for the production of gemstones in each calendar quarter during the term of the agreement and cree has agreed to supply this amount of crystals to us 
although we signed an agreement in february with norstel for the purchase of sic crystals as further described below  the quantities received from norstel through have been less than of total annual purchases 
although we expect purchases from norstel during to significantly increase as a percentage of total purchases  we remain dependent on cree for the majority of our supply of lab grown sic crystals until norstel can deliver an increased quantity of crystals 
we are obligated to purchase a minimum quantity of usable material on a quarterly basis if cree meets certain minimum quality levels 
we purchased from cree approximately million  million  and million of sic crystals during   and  respectively 
we anticipate purchasing approximately million from cree in our price per gram for purchases from cree during is increasing by approximately over what we paid per gram in the fourth quarter of and over what we paid per gram during the first three quarters of under the exclusive supply agreement  cree has agreed not to sell sic crystals for gemstone applications to anyone other than us 
when our orders for sic crystals exceed the capacity of the existing crystal growth systems  cree may  at its sole discretion  require us to purchase the additional growth systems needed or fund the cost of the systems on its own and recoup its costs by incorporating the costs of the additional systems into the cost of the sic crystals 
if we fund the costs of the crystal growth systems  cree must use of the output from these systems for our needs  unless the excess production exceeds our then current needs  in which case cree may sell such sic crystals to any of its other customers for any use other than jewel applications 
the title to these crystal growth systems passes to cree once we have fully depreciated them 
if cree elects to fund the cost of additional growth systems on its own  we have no assurance that cree will sell all of the output from these crystal growth systems to us or fill all of our orders  but cree will be obligated to use the capacity to supply the quantities that we are required to purchase 
additionally  when cree adds new crystal growth systems  we must commit to purchase all of the output of the new systems for at least six months 
any delay or reduction in the availability of sic crystals from cree could delay or limit our ability to deliver and sell our moissanite jewels  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the exclusive supply agreement had an initial term through june  and in january we exercised our option to extend the agreement until july the exclusive supply agreement with cree prohibits us  without cree s consent  from entering into an exclusive marketing or distribution agreement with debeers or any party that cree reasonably believes is affiliated with any of the following parties debeers  the central selling organization the international cartel of diamond producers or its successors  any party whose primary business is the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of diamond gemstones  or any non gemstone and non jewelry industry competitor of cree 

table of contents these provisions may limit our potentially available avenues of distribution and could prevent us from entering into certain potentially profitable transactions 
exclusive supply agreement with norstel 
in february  we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel formerly jesperator ab for the supply of sic crystals for use in the manufacturing of moissanite jewels 
the agreement gives us the exclusive right to purchase sic crystals from norstel for the purpose of fabricating  distributing or selling faceted jewels 
in march  we signed an amended agreement with norstel that extended the term to december  we are currently negotiating another amendment to our contract with norstel that will further extend the term of our agreement and reduce our purchase commitments for and  while increasing the total purchase commitment over the length of the contract 
under the terms of the march amendment  our purchase commitment to norstel is million for and million for this purchase commitment is contingent upon norstel being able to deliver sic crystals of acceptable quality in the amount committed 
based on the current negotiations with norstel  we currently expect our commitment to norstel to be for million of sic crystals in with undetermined amounts in future years 
we purchased  of sic crystals from norstel during and norstel has not yet proven that it has the capability of producing significantly greater quantities of materials of suitable quality and sizes 
of the amount purchased in   was expensed as research and development costs 
we do not anticipate any future research and development costs under the agreement with norstel 
in addition  we have advanced  to norstel for the purchase of certain equipment 
this advance began to be repaid in january through a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals 
effective october   pursuant to the amended agreement with norstel  we began receiving a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals  and will continue to receive this reduction until the advance is repaid 
our current negotiations with norstel may result in a reduction of this percentage from the level 
the balance on the advance as of december  was  the agreement provides us with an option to extend the term of the agreement for a four year period 
intellectual property we have us product and method patents for moissanite jewels  expiring in  under which we have broad  exclusive rights to manufacture  use and sell moissanite jewels in the united states 
we have these same patents in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support the charles colvard moissanite branding strategy 
although we intend to enforce our patent and trademark rights  we cannot be sure that such actions will be successful  that any additional patents will be issued  that any issued patent will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that any issued patent will have any competitive or commercial value 
our success and our ability to compete successfully depend heavily upon our proprietary technology 
in addition to our patents  we rely on trade secret laws and employee  consultant and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology from disclosure or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
with one exception discussed below  we have not received any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties and we have no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against us with respect to our existing and future products 
litigation to determine the validity of any third party s claims could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor 
in the event of an adverse result of any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses for  and pay royalties on the use of  the technology subject to the litigation 
we have no assurance that we would be successful in such development or that any such license would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
on october   the company received an english translation of an action filed on june  in the south korean intellectual property office by mc lab corporation 
mc lab corporation sought 
table of contents invalidation of the company s current south korean patent on the basis of an alleged lack of inventiveness as compared to certain prior art 
in september  the petition by mc lab corporation to invalidate our patent was dismissed 
on september   mc lab corporation filed a notice of appeal with the patent court 
management believes that the south korean patent was properly issued and we will continue to vigorously defend the action 
we do not presently have material sales in south korea and the decision will not be legally binding in any other jurisdiction 
manufacturing the production of moissanite jewels includes the following steps growing sic crystals  designing shapes with proportions unique to moissanite jewels  cutting crystals into preforms that will yield jewels of an approximate carat weight and millimeter size  faceting preforms into jewels  and inspecting  sorting and grading faceted jewels 
growth of sic crystals 
cree has grown the majority of our sic crystals in accordance with the terms of the exclusive supply agreement 
under the exclusive supply agreement  cree is required to sell to us all of the crystals grown in a specified number of crystal growth systems without charging us for such crystal growth systems 
in addition  cree must sell to us all the crystals grown in the crystal growth systems acquired by us from cree  unless cree s capacity exceeds our then current needs  in which case cree may sell sic crystals produced by these systems to any of its other customers for any use other than moissanite jewel applications 
we may increase our production capacity from cree upon appropriate notice to cree 
if we order a quantity of crystals that will require cree to acquire additional crystal growth systems  cree may elect  in its sole discretion  to have us purchase the additional growth systems that will be needed or to fund the costs on its own and recoup its costs by incorporating the costs of the systems into the cost of the sic crystals sold to us 
we routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from sic crystals being produced by cree 
the yield of saleable moissanite jewels from each crystal is the most significant factor affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale 
yield of saleable moissanite jewels is dependent on the quality of the crystals 
improvements in crystal quality increase the volume  or yield  of moissanite jewels from a crystal and decrease the cost of each moissanite jewel produced 
improvements in crystal quality have contributed to our increased gross profit margin percentage over the past five years 
variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
designing shapes with proportions unique to moissanite jewels 
maximizing the light reflected from a faceted moissanite jewel requires the design of shapes with unique proportions and angles 
we create proprietary designs  using computer modeling  to display the maximum light reflection based on the optical properties ie  refractive index  dispersion and luster of moissanite jewels 
the first shape we developed applying these computer models was a moissanite version unique facet angles and proportions of the standard round brilliant cut 
more recently  we have designed modified square brilliant and modified round brilliant shapes 
we believe these proprietary designs are the basis for the superior optical performance quality observed in faceted moissanite jewels 
preforms 
we divide all sic crystals through slicing and dicing processes into preforms in sizes suitable for faceting into predetermined calibrated size moissanite jewels 
we use readily available automated and computerized equipment along with proprietary technology developed in house to slice and dice crystals into preforms 
we believe that this equipment will enable us to maximize the number of preforms we can obtain from each sic crystal 

table of contents faceting moissanite jewels 
the faceting of preforms is a critical stage in obtaining quality jewels 
the techniques and skills used in faceting moissanite jewels differ somewhat from those used in faceting diamonds and other gemstones 
we currently outsource the faceting of our moissanite jewels  other than faceting for small special orders or research and product development purposes  which we conduct internally 
during  we intend to continue to outsource faceting services to our existing suppliers  and we will depend on their ability to provide an adequate quantity of quality faceted moissanite jewels 
we cannot be sure that they will be able to continue to produce our quality specifications for faceting and meet our quantity and time requirements 
currently  we have three suppliers of volume faceting services  all of which are located in asia  and we have been satisfied with the capabilities and performance of each of these suppliers 
the majority of our faceting services currently are provided by john m 
bachman  inc jmb  as discussed below 
in  we entered into a multi year agreement with jmb 
we have a right of first refusal to acquire any excess gemstone cutting capacity from jmb s affiliate and any equity securities offered by jmb or its affiliate 
our agreement with jmb expires march   however  we have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon days written notice 
under this agreement  jmb has agreed to grant  and to cause its affiliates to grant  to us a perpetual  non exclusive  royalty free license to use any inventions or proprietary information developed by or for jmb or its affiliates that is useful in the faceting of moissanite jewels 
we are currently working on a new agreement with jmb that is anticipated to extend the term and reduce our monthly faceting levels 
inspection  sorting and grading 
once faceted moissanite jewels are returned to us  we inspect  sort and grade them 
during this stage  specially trained personnel individually examine and grade each moissanite jewel against certain quality parameters 
in addition  we process a sample of each batch through an image analyzer for exacting quality control 
this phase of manufacturing is relatively labor intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force 
in the future  we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to an independent third party 
we will require third parties to which we outsource these processes to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards 
we have no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain sufficient numbers of appropriately skilled personnel for this phase of manufacturing or find and enter into acceptable agreements with third party vendors or that such vendors will be able to provide accurate inspection  sorting and grading services on a timely basis 
marketing and distribution marketing domestic 
while our primary consumer market consists of women purchasing moissanite jewelry for themselves  there is a growing opportunity in promoting it as a gift 
at the consumer level  charles colvard has positioned moissanite jewelry as the perfect reward or indulgence for women to purchase for themselves in celebrating a personal or professional milestone  achievement or important life event 
in through  we delivered this message through internet based and search optimization marketing  fashion  lifestyle and consumer magazine advertisements and through supporting retailers with newspaper ads  select broadcast  out of home outdoor and point of purchase marketing 
in  we plan to continue marketing moissanite as a unique jewel with brilliance and fire unmatched by any gemstone and positioning it as a perfect self indulgence or gift 
we will continue delivering this message through similar marketing and advertising vehicles 
we believe our marketing and advertising has continued to strengthen the image and reputation of our brand  charles colvard  and our product  moissanite jewels 
research conducted by independent sources indicates that moissanite awareness among us women has increased from in january to in january and continued at in january  with higher levels of interest  shopping  and ownership than in january in october  a new study showed the awareness level of moissanite at nearly 
we intend to conduct further comparative research in october to develop a clearer understanding of this seasonal variation 

table of contents in through  our marketing message to the jewelry trade positioned moissanite jewelry as a new jewelry category which provided a profitable business opportunity new customer base  higher average retail sales per item  healthy margins  and a new incremental category 
we plan to continue marketing this message to the jewelry trade in via the key trade publication  national jeweler 
we believe that trade public relations will continue to generate editorial interest and coverage about moissanite and its positive impact to the trade 
in we continued to support our existing customers and moissanite retailers with marketing collateral  advertising  and public relations efforts 
we believe our retailer marketing support program has resulted in a consistent and positive moissanite message to both consumers and the jewelry trade 
we plan to continue supporting our retailers in with various marketing programs to include such media vehicles as newspaper advertising  retailer tagging in consumer magazines  marketing collateral  point of purchase materials and sales associate training designed to increase moissanite jewelry sales 
public relations activities are an important component of our marketing strategy and are integral to supporting the launch of new moissanite retailers 
our ongoing key public relations activities in and going forward include the following expand awareness and increase purchase intent by generating editorial coverage in fashion  jewelry industry trade  and general nationwide press outlets print  broadcast  web and non traditional vehicles 
increase moissanite jewelry product placement and broadcast media references 
develop news stories and announcements to appear on local and national television news programs and newspaper markets throughout the us capitalize on public relations activities that promote both charles colvard as a brand  and moissanite as product  including but not limited to sponsorships and special media events 
our marketing and public relations efforts in will focus on increasing moissanite awareness  interest and purchase intent at the consumer level  which we believe will increase demand for moissanite jewels 
we intend to continue consumer advertising  promotion  product placement opportunities  sponsorship opportunities and an expanded publicity public relations effort  continuous sales training for the sales associates at the retail level  and individually tailored sales and marketing programs designed for specific retailers in order to increase moissanite awareness and moissanite jewelry purchases by consumers 
international 
internationally  we work with our distributors to develop advertising and marketing campaigns targeting specific geographic regions building on the marketing messages  images  strategies  and themes that have proven successful in developing the us market 
pursuant to our international distribution agreements  we provide incentives in the form of cooperative advertising and marketing allowance to our customers who advertise consistent messages that support the brand image for charles colvard created moissanite 
trade shows 
charles colvard will continue to participate in the leading jewelry trade shows  worldwide  as either a sponsor  exhibitor or a participant assisting our manufacturing clients 
in  we exhibited in baselworld in switzerland  hong kong jewellery show and the jck las vegas show 
we also participated in the great britain jewellery fair in birmingham  uk and attended the jewelers of america shows in new york during in  charles colvard will exhibit at baselworld  jck las vegas  and the hong kong jewellery shows and we will assist our manufacturing clients as a participant in other domestic and international jewelry trade expositions 
in  charles colvard participated as a major sponsor of a significant jewelry trade event cibjo the world jewellery confederation in south africa 
charles colvard will continue its sponsorship of the cibjo conference scheduled in to be held in dubai 

table of contents distribution according to preliminary estimates provided by the international diamond exchange  the consumer market in for jewelry sales in the united states was approximately billion 
domestic 
traditionally  consumers have purchased jewelry through independent and chain jewelry stores and department stores 
however  in the past two decades  the once thought of as non traditional distribution channels catalog showrooms  mass market discounters  price clubs  mail order  tv shopping channels and electronic commerce on the internet have emerged as significant channels 
independent consumer awareness research surveys have echoed the importance of on air broadcast and the internet as marketing and sales delivery vehicles 
today  moissanite jewelry is sold to consumers through a broad range of channels single and multiple location independent jewelry stores  jewelry store chains  online  tv shopping channels  department stores  and in catalogs 
we believe that moissanite is best sold through retail channels in which the retailer has an adequate opportunity to effectively educate the consumer on moissanite s unique qualities 
in order to more rapidly expand the distribution of moissanite  in may we transitioned from selling moissanite jewels directly to independent retail jewelers to allowing independent retail jewelers to access loose moissanite jewels and moissanite jewelry through two established jewelry distributors  stuller and rio grande 
additionally  we have entered into arrangements with several jewelry manufacturers  most notably reeves park  sai  and richline dba alarama alarama  that design and manufacture lines of jewelry containing moissanite jewels 
jewelry retailers have access to loose moissanite jewels from stuller and rio grande and to jewelry containing moissanite jewels from stuller  reeves park  sai  alarama  and other jewelry manufacturers 
we believe that moissanite jewels provide retailers with an opportunity to earn a profit margin from the moissanite jewelry category that compares favorably to other jewelry products and allows retailers to distinguish our product line from other jewelry in the highly competitive retail jewelry market 
we also believe moissanite jewelry provides retailers with an opportunity to appeal to the self purchasing female market that typically spends disposable income on other products such as shoes  handbags and other indulgences and moissanite jewelry offers retailers with another jewelry alternative in the gift category 
we believe moissanite jewelry margins create incentives for retailers to maximize their sales and promotional efforts  resulting in additional consumer demand for our moissanite jewels 
we believe that distributing moissanite jewels through distributors as well as certain jewelry manufacturers and designers provides retail jewelers with maximum flexibility to develop their businesses with moissanite 
those jewelers that prefer to create their own jewelry to meet the needs of their individual market areas will be able to purchase the loose jewels through distributors  with which many of them already have relationships 
those jewelers that wish to purchase finished jewelry for sale in their stores may do so either through distributors or any of the jewelry manufacturers working with moissanite 
the quality  design and workmanship of the settings chosen by distributors  manufacturers  designers and retailers affects consumer perception and acceptance of our jewel  and our control over these elements is limited to our pricing and licensing policies 
beyond that  we believe that the success of charles colvard created moissanite will be determined by the power and the precision of our brand building program 
we continue to evaluate the most appropriate structure for distribution in north america and may  in certain circumstances  enter into additional distribution arrangements  including arrangements with selected department stores and distribution channels such as moissanite retail stores  catalog sales or internet sales 
by combining the manufacturers strength of jewelry design and program execution with our beautiful jewel  our distribution message is that we can provide a compelling revenue pipeline to retailers 
several manufacturers successfully introduced or expanded their distribution of moissanite with multi door chains 
during  we expanded our program to all kohl s doors  expanded our presence on tv 
table of contents shopping with hours at the home shopping network hsn compared to hours in  secured chain wide distribution at all stores with full service jewelry departments at belk doors and the army air force exchange system aafes doors and expanded our internet presence with amazon 
com 
based on test distribution of moissanite jewelry during and at gordon s  zales canada  and sears  these retailers will not have a moissanite jewelry program in while we did lose distribution at certain retailers during  the overall number of stores carrying moissanite has increased due to the kohl s rollout 
at december   chains with greater than stores that sell moissanite jewelry are jcpenney  finlay  kohl s  helzberg jewelers  aafes and belk 
our two largest customers  reeves park and sai  accounted for  and of our sales during  respectively 
our third largest customer  stuller accounted for of our sales during and is our biggest supplier to independent retail jewelers 
k g creations represented of our sales  however  we have terminated our manufacturing agreement with k g creations and k g creations is not expected to be a manufacturer of moissanite jewelry in we have worked with the retailers previously supplied by k g creations to establish relationships with new manufacturers 
as the transition is made to new manufacturers  we will likely see a short term negative impact on our results of operations 
while we believe our current relationship with our three largest customers is good  and alternate manufacturers and distributors are available to serve their customer base  a loss of these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 
we expect that  at least over the short term  we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our manufacturing customers to maintain and enhance their retail programs 
we believe that we have developed a testing template that can enable us to successfully introduce moissanite jewelry at new points of distribution 
generally  we seek to participate with the retailers in training their sales and marketing personnel in moissanite sales positioning and strategies and in working with them to create focused advertising and promotional efforts to publicize trunk shows and other special sales events at the test store locations 
in addition  to facilitate new distribution  we have allowed inventory to be taken on a consignment basis 
charles colvard recognizes revenue on consignment shipments on the earlier of the sale of the jewelry by the retailer or the retailer or manufacturer agreeing to take ownership of the jewels without recourse 
of the  of inventory on consignment at december   the company expects  on consignment with k g to be returned 
the remaining  is on consignment primarily with three customers and represents potential revenue of  and potential gross profit of  based on the average cost per carat of inventory at december  we believe that our sales on television shopping channels demonstrated that the consumer understands the value and beauty of our jewel and has resulted in increased interest from key traditional jewelry retailers such as those described above 
we will also continue to seek or expand into channels such as independent jewelry retail stores  catalog  showrooms  mail order  tv shopping channels  internet  department store  specialty stores and mass retail 
we believe that the growing consumer acceptance of moissanite will allow charles colvard to expand into these various channels 
as we expand  we will manage the issues surrounding the multiple channel distribution method with the need for a consistent brand building program 
international 
while we have focused most of our resources on the domestic market  we have continued to invest in certain international markets that we believe have the most potential with respect to acceptance and sales of the moissanite jewel 
in october  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong  charles colvard hk ltd  for the purpose of gaining better access to the far eastern markets 
the importance of having a presence in this market is twofold hong kong is the headquarters city for a very large number of jewelry manufacturing companies with sales and distribution worldwide  and hong kong is the gateway to the markets of mainland china 
to enhance our presence in this market  we established a controlled company in china in august called guangzhou charles colvard trading limited 
during  foreign sales were of our total sales 
more details on our financial information by geographic area is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 

table of contents we currently have distributors for moissanite jewels covering substantially all of western europe  australia  india and certain countries in southeast asia and the middle east 
we have approximately international distributors and intend to increase this number 
all sales to international customers are denominated in us dollars 
generally  we require full payment before merchandise is shipped to these customers 
however  once a customer has established a purchase history  we may grant payment terms to our international customers 
export sales aggregated approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
it should be noted that a portion of our international sales is due to jewels sold internationally that are re imported to north american retailers 
similar to the united states  we have begun distributing through tv retailers internationally 
specifically  we have developed relationships with our manufacturing customers at ideal world shopping in the uk  viva tv network in taiwan  hse in germany  jupiter shop channel in japan  and m boutique la chaine in france 
we believe that we are positioned for future growth in this distribution channel 
we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in international distribution channels 
please refer to item a risk factors of this annual report on form k for more details on these risks 
seasonality retail sales of moissanite jewelry are significantly greater during the christmas and holiday season 
because we sell direct to manufacturers and distributors  our sales to support the holiday season take place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters  depending on the level of advance planning and production our customers undertake 
the second half of each year accounted for   and of our sales during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effect of seasonality on our business depends on the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of inventory maintained by our customers  which could significantly affect our sales in a given quarter  regardless of seasonality 
working capital practices our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
the current status of our working capital is discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section of item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
because our supply agreements for raw material purchases restrict the sale of sic crystals for jewelry applications to only us  the suppliers negotiate minimum purchase commitments with us that may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain 
management considers its investment in inventory essential to be able to meet the orders of its expanding customer base and to fulfill requests from our customers for consigned inventory 
our current inventory levels are sufficient to enable us to respond promptly to customer orders and we currently have no material order backlogs 
our standard payment terms are generally between and days for jewel distributors and generally between to days for jewelry manufacturers 
in some circumstances  we may extend terms longer than days 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral 
we believe that our payment terms are consistent with the payment terms offered in the jewelry industry 
the company s return policy is that jewels can only be returned for credit within days of shipment and must be returned for a valid reason eg quality problems or a shipment of the wrong jewels 
some customers  however  have a contractual right to return a certain percentage of sales for any reason 
we have established an allowance for returns based on our historical return rate  which takes into account any contractual return privileges granted to our customers 
periodically  we sell jewels to our customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an 
table of contents absolute right of return for a specified period 
our customers are generally required to make payments on memo shipments within days upon the customer informing us that they will keep the jewels 
accordingly  we do not recognize revenue on these memo transactions until the earlier of the customer informing us that they will keep the jewels or the expiration of the right of return period 
of the  of inventory on consignment at december   the company expects  on consignment with k g creations to be returned 
the remaining  is on consignment primarily with three customers and represents potential revenue of  and potential gross profit of  based on the average cost per carat of inventory at december  competition gemstone materials can be grouped into three types natural gemstone  which is found in nature  synthetic gemstone  which has the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab  and simulated or substitute material  which is similar in appearance to natural gemstone but does not have the same chemical composition nor physical or optical characteristics 
our moissanite jewel  which is positioned as a unique new jewel  may compete with fine gemstones such as ruby  sapphire  emerald and tanzanite as well as with natural  synthetic  and treated diamonds and existing synthetic gemstones such as synthetic cubic zirconia 
we may also face competition from synthetic diamonds  synthetic diamond films and other sources of synthetic moissanite not presently available in qualities  sizes and volumes suitable for use as gemstones 
many of the suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones  as well as the suppliers of synthetic gemstones  have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do 
the worldwide market for large  uncut high quality natural diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by debeers headquartered in london  alrosa russia  rio tinto australia and bhp canada 
these companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of natural diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels 
diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels 
we may also face competition from treated and synthetic diamonds 
treated diamonds  which are natural diamonds with imperfections or flaws that have been altered in some manner to enhance their appearance  have been available for the past years in the jewelry industry and are generally less expensive than diamonds of similar size  cut and color which have not been altered 
synthetic diamonds are also available in the marketplace and are produced for jewelry applications available to consumers  however  most synthetic diamonds that are sold today are in the yellow color range 
although we believe that colorless gemstone quality synthetic and treated diamonds presently cannot be produced at prices competitive with those currently offered for our near colorless moissanite jewels  there can be no assurances that such competitive prices cannot be achieved in the future by the producers of either or both of synthetic and treated diamonds 
the primary producers of synthetic diamonds used for industrial applications are debeers  sumitomo and ge 
there are also a number of russian producers of synthetic diamonds for industrial uses 
in addition  companies such as the gemesis corporation  chatham and apollo diamonds are synthesizing diamonds  in limited quantities  limited carat sizes and in limited ranges of color 
synthetic diamond films can be grown at commercially viable prices in thicknesses that can be applied to various surfaces such as other synthetic materials 
although we believe that our products have a proprietary position  we could face competition from other companies that develop competing sic technologies 
some of these technologies could be developed by producers of sic used for other industrial applications 
manufacturers of industrial sic products include the carborundum corporation  for abrasive uses  and cree  siemens ag  norstel  bridgestone abb  
table of contents dow chemical  sic crystal ag  and northrup grumman corporation  for semiconductor uses 
we believe that cree and norstel are currently the only suppliers of sic crystals in colors  sizes and volumes suitable for gemstone applications 
it is possible  however  that these or other producers of sic could develop sic crystals suitable for gemstone applications and produce moissanite jewels until we could obtain judicial enforcement of our patent rights 
we may also face competition from synthetic cubic zirconia  the principal existing diamond simulant and  to a lesser degree  other synthetic gemstones 
the largest producer of synthetic cubic zirconia gemstones is signity 
in addition  there are a significant number of other producers of jewelry containing synthetic gemstones 
three of the largest retailers of synthetic cubic zirconia jewelry in the united states are qvc  hsn and wal mart 
some of the major retailers of synthetic cubic zirconia  including qvc  have captive manufacturing divisions that produce synthetic cubic zirconia jewelry 
these producers and sellers may see their markets being eroded by the introduction of our moissanite jewels 
we believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels 
we intend to compete primarily on the basis that the unique qualities of our moissanite jewels are distinct from all other jewels based on their fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
in addition  we believe that the charles colvard created moissanite brand  which is being developed pursuant to our marketing program  can create a long term competitive advantage for our products 
additionally  we believe that moissanite jewels have a significant cost advantage over other fine gemstones  especially in the one carat size and larger 
our competitive success depends  in part  on the following the willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers  manufacturers and designers to market and promote moissanite jewels to the retail jewelry trade  the willingness of distributors  retailers and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose moissanite jewels and the willingness of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels  the ability of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our jewels  the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in jewelry with high quality workmanship  the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell moissanite jewelry to consumers  and the increasing interest and demand for moissanite jewelry at the consumer level 
government regulation our products are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission ftc 
the ftc has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials 
while we intend to comply fully with all ftc regulations  we cannot be sure that the ftc or a competitor will not challenge our promotional or marketing activities 
such a challenge could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management  whether or not such challenge is resolved in our favor 
if our actions were found to be in violation of ftc regulations  we could be forced to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate ftc regulations 
employees at february   we had employees 
we believe that our future prospects will depend  in part  on our ability to retain our current employees and to obtain additional management  marketing  sales  manufacturing  scientific and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is substantial  and the number of persons with relevant experience in the jewelry industry is limited 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  you should carefully consider the following important factors that in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual performance and results and could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
the jewelry retail industry may be experiencing sluggish growth as a result of declining consumer confidence and general economic pressures on consumer spending 
luxury products  such as fine jewelry  are discretionary purchases for consumers 
a reduction in consumer discretionary spending affects our industry more significantly than many other industries 
economic factors outside of our control could affect consumer discretionary spending  including the financial markets  consumer credit availability  prevailing interest rates  energy costs  employment levels  salary levels and tax rates 
any persistent reduction in discretionary consumer spending could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
a further decline in sales could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
our annual sales declined from million in to million in and million in a further decline in sales could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers and distributors and adversely affect our ability to retain key employees 
due to the large inventory position we currently have  we plan to reduce our manufacturing levels in future years until our inventory position is more in line with our needed supply 
we have already reduced our raw material purchase commitment with cree and are in negotiations to reduce our commitment to norstel 
we expect to purchase approximately million of sic crystals in  down from million in we have no assurance that the quality of the raw material crystals we receive will not be affected by the reduced purchase levels or that our raw material suppliers will be able to timely deliver increased quantities to us should we require a return to a higher level of purchases 
additionally  due to our lower purchase commitments  we have experienced price increases that will affect future gross margin percentages 
the reduction in raw material purchases could have a negative long term impact on our relationships with our suppliers 
in addition  we intend to significantly reduce the amount of jewels we facet during we believe our primary supplier of faceting services  jmb  is substantially dependent on our business to fund its operations 
we can not be assured that jmb will be able to continue in business with our reduced faceting levels 
if jmb were to go out of business  we would need to increase the capacity for faceting moissanite jewels at the other two suppliers of this service 
we have no assurance that these other suppliers of faceting services could meet our demand for increased capacity on a timely basis or that we will not experience increased prices for our faceting services 
we expect to remain dependent upon cree for the supply of most of our sic crystals for the foreseeable future 
cree has certain proprietary rights relating to its process for growing large single crystals of sic and its process for growing colorless sic crystals 
under our exclusive supply agreement with cree  we are obligated to buy from cree  and cree is obligated to sell to us  at least  by dollar volume  of our 
table of contents requirements for sic material for the production of gemstones in each calendar quarter 
in february  we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel  which was amended in march the quantities of sic crystals received from norstel through have been less than of total annual purchases 
our ability to decrease our reliance on cree  in the short term  is contingent on norstel being capable of producing quality crystals in higher quantities than it has in the past 
although we expect purchases from norstel during to significantly increase as a percentage of total purchases  we remain dependent on cree for most of our supply of lab grown sic crystals 
while cree has improved its production processes and is currently producing sic crystals sufficient to meet our requirements  we have experienced difficulties in the past in obtaining crystals from cree in the quality  sizes and volumes that we desired 
there can be no assurance that cree will be able to continue to produce and supply us with sic crystals of sufficient quality  sizes and volumes that we desire nor that we will successfully negotiate purchase commitments that enable us to manage our inventories and raw material costs effectively 
in addition  although norstel represents a potential additional source of supply  norstel has not yet proven to have the capability to produce significant quantities of sic crystals of suitable quality and sizes  and there can be no assurance that it will ever develop these capabilities 
through the first two months of  norstel has delivered  of sic crystals compared to  delivered during all of for the sale of our jewels in north america  we are substantially dependent on reeves park  samuel aaron international and stuller settings  inc  as well as a limited number of other distributors and jewelry manufacturers 
we anticipate that the majority of the moissanite jewels that we sell in north america will be distributed through reeves park  sai  and stuller  as well as a limited number of other manufacturers and distributors  and therefore  we are substantially dependent upon these companies for distribution of moissanite jewels in north america 
during the year ended december   reeves park  sai  and stuller accounted for   and of total sales  respectively 
during the year ended december   k g creations represented of our total sales 
we have terminated our manufacturing agreement with k g creations and k g creations is not expected to be a manufacturer of moissanite jewelry in we are working with the retailers previously supplied by k g creations to establish relationships between those retail accounts and new manufacturers  and likely will experience a short term negative impact on our results of operations during this transition period 
the financial difficulties or insolvency of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect results 
we are subject to a concentration of credit risk amongst our major customers and a default by any of these customers on their debts to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position 
future sales and our ability to collect accounts receivable depend  in part  on the financial strength of customers 
we estimate an allowance for accounts for which collectibility is at risk and this allowance adversely impacts profitability 
in the event customers experience greater than anticipated financial difficulties or insolvency  profitability would be expected to be adversely impacted by the company s failure to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated allowance 
we are subject to certain risks due to our international distribution channels and vendors 
we currently have approximately international distributors for moissanite jewels covering substantially all of western europe  australia  india  and certain countries in southeast asia and the middle east 
our long term strategy is to expand the number of international markets for our products 
in addition  we expect to continue to use certain companies based outside the united states to facet our moissanite jewels 
due to our reliance on development of foreign markets and use of foreign vendors  we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include the following the adverse effects on united states based companies operating in foreign markets that might result from war  terrorism  changes in diplomatic  trade or business relationships or other political  social  religious or economic instability  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and 
table of contents the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  while the majority of all foreign transactions are denominated in us dollars  foreign currency fluctuations could impact demand for our products or the ability of our foreign suppliers to continue to perform 
further  some of these distributors operate relatively small businesses and may not have the financial stability to assure their continuing presence in their markets 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our anticipated business practices 
our future financial performance depends upon growth and consumer acceptance of our products 
we believe that many retail jewelers and most consumers are not generally aware of the existence and attributes of moissanite jewels 
the market for moissanite jewels among retail jewelers and consumers is in the early stages of development 
total moissanite jewelry retail sales during the year ended december  were less than of the total jewelry market 
the degree of future market acceptance and demand are subject to a significant amount of uncertainty 
our future financial performance will depend upon greater consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels as distinct from all other jewels based on their fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
in addition  consumer acceptance may be affected by retail jewelers and jewelry manufacturers acceptance of moissanite jewels 
we market loose jewels which jewelry distributors  manufacturers and retailers set in jewelry and in turn distribute or sell to consumers 
the quality  design and workmanship of the jewelry settings selected by retail jewelers  which is not within our control  could affect our consumers perception and acceptance of our jewels 
thus  our future financial performance may be affected by the willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers  manufacturers and designers to market and promote moissanite jewels to the retail jewelry trade  the willingness of distributors  retailers and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose moissanite jewels and the willingness of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels  the ability of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our jewels  the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in jewelry with high quality workmanship  and the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell moissanite jewelry to consumers 
if our products do not receive greater market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we have united states product and method patents for moissanite jewels under which we believe that we have broad  exclusive rights to manufacture  use and sell moissanite jewels in the united states 
we have these same patents in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
we believe that these patents create substantial technological barriers to our potential competitors 
at the present time  we are also dependent on cree s technology for the production of sic crystals 
cree is exclusively licensed to use a patent concerning a process for growing large single crystals of sic  has certain patents of its own relating to growth of large single crystals of sic and has a patent for a process for growing colorless sic crystals 
if norstel becomes a significant additional source of supply  we will also become dependent on its technology 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by or to us  cree or norstel will provide any significant commercial protection  that we  cree or norstel will have sufficient resources to prosecute our respective patents or that any patents will be upheld by a court should we  or our suppliers seek to enforce our respective rights against an infringer 
the existence of valid patents does not prevent other companies from independently developing competing technologies as evidenced by our agreement 
table of contents with norstel 
existing producers of sic crystals or others may refine existing processes for growing sic crystals or develop new technologies for growing large single crystals of sic or colorless sic crystals in a manner that does not infringe patents owned or licensed by us  cree or norstel 
in addition  existing producers of sic crystals  existing producers of other synthetic or natural gemstones or other parties may develop new technologies for producing moissanite jewels in a manner that does not infringe patents owned or licensed by us  cree or norstel 
as a result of the foregoing factors  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with or superior to our products  and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends upon our ability to identify  reach agreements with and work successfully with third parties 
in addition to our current dependence on cree and on third party distribution channels  our prospects depend upon our ability to identify  reach agreements with and work successfully with other third parties 
in particular  we rely on third parties to facet our jewels 
faceting moissanite jewels requires different techniques than faceting diamonds and other gemstones 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain our relationships with our faceting vendors on terms satisfactory to us or that faceting vendors will continue to be able to provide faceting services in the quality and quantities required by us or that we will be able to find suitable replacements if we are unable to maintain such relationships 
our failure to achieve any of the above would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
governmental regulation and oversight might adversely impact our operations 
we are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels 
in particular  the federal trade commission has the power to restrict the offer and sale of products that could deceive or have the tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers with regard to its type  kind  quality  character  origin or other characteristics 
we may be under close scrutiny both by governmental agencies and by competitors in the gemstone industry  any of which may challenge our promotion and marketing of our moissanite jewel products 
if our production or marketing of moissanite jewels is challenged by governmental agencies or competitors  or if regulations are issued that restrict our ability to market our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our reputation among jewelers and consumers could be damaged if low quality gemstones or synthetics are marketed as moissanite 
it is possible that low quality gemstones or other synthetics could be marketed as moissanite 
the sale of low quality products as moissanite could damage our ability to foster the perception of moissanite as a unique jewel that compares favorably to other fine gemstones like diamond  ruby and emerald 
this could damage our reputation among retail jewelers and consumers and result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products 
the introduction of low quality imitation moissanite jewels and our inability to limit the adverse effects thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face competition in the worldwide jewelry industry 
the jewelry industry is highly competitive and we compete with numerous other jewelry products  including diamonds  cubic zirconium  and watches  among others 
in addition  despite the positioning of moissanite as a unique jewel  we face competition from treated diamonds  synthetic diamonds  and companies developing other synthetic jewelry technologies 
a substantial number of companies supply products to the jewelry industry  many of which we believe have greater financial resources than we do 
competitors could develop new or improved technologies that may render the pricing point for moissanite noncompetitive  which would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
sales of moissanite jewelry could be dependent upon the pricing of precious metals  which is beyond our control 
any increases in the market price of precious metals primarily gold could affect the pricing and sales of jewelry incorporating moissanite jewels 
the majority of price increases in precious metals are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for finished jewelry 
these higher prices could have a negative impact on the sell through of moissanite jewelry at the retail level 
from the 
table of contents beginning of to the end of  the price of gold has increased significantly approximately  resulting in higher retail price points for gold jewelry 
this has had a negative impact on both sales of moissanite jewelry and the jewelry industry as a whole 
we currently encourage our customers to only set moissanite jewels in jewelry with a gold quality of karat or better or platinum 
due to the high gold prices  we are currently reassessing this strategy 
if the trading price of our common stock fails to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global market  we would face possible delisting  which would result in a limited public market for our common stock and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market and is subject to certain listing requirements  including the requirement that the closing bid price for our shares of common stock not trade below for consecutive business days 
on february  the price of our shares was 
if we do not continue to comply with the nasdaq listing requirements  nasdaq may provide written notification to us regarding the de listing of our securities 
at that time  we would have the right to request a hearing to appeal the nasdaq determination and would also have the option to apply to transfer our securities to the nasdaq capital market 
we cannot be sure that our price will comply with the requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market  or that any appeal of a decision to de list our common stock will be successful 
if our common stock loses its status on the nasdaq global market and we are not successful in obtaining a listing on the nasdaq capital market  shares of our common stock would likely trade in the over the counter market bulletin board  commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
if our stock were to trade on the over the counter market  selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold  transactions could be delayed  and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced 
in addition  in the event our common stock is de listed  broker dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them  which may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  further limiting the liquidity thereof 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of common stock 
such de listing from the nasdaq global market or future declines in our stock price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing  and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions 
some anti takeover provisions of our charter documents  agreements and plans may delay or prevent a takeover of the company 
a number of provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws impact matters of corporate governance and the rights of shareholders 
certain of these provisions have an anti takeover effect and may delay or prevent takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors including takeovers that certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions also could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by shareholders 
we believe that these provisions are appropriate to protect our interests and all of our shareholders 
under the terms of the exclusive supply agreement  we are prohibited from entering into an exclusive marketing or distribution agreement with debeers or its affiliates or any party whose primary business is the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of diamond gemstones or any non gemstone and non jewelry industry competitor of cree 
the agreement also prohibits us from entering into certain merger  acquisition  sale of assets or similar transactions with a prohibited party 
these provisions of the exclusive supply agreement with cree could limit the price that third parties might be willing to pay in the future for some or all of the shares of our common stock 
in addition  this agreement could prevent us from entering into certain potentially profitable transactions with such prohibited parties 

table of contents on february   we adopted a shareholder rights plan under which all shareholders of record as of march   received rights to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock 
each share of common stock issued after march  has received the same rights 
the rights plan is designed to enable all of our shareholders to realize the full value of their investment and to provide for fair and equal treatment for all shareholders in the event that an unsolicited attempt is made to acquire us 
the adoption of the rights plan is intended as a means to guard against abusive takeover tactics and is not in response to any particular proposal 
the rights  which expire in  will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  all shareholders except the purchaser will be entitled to acquire our common stock at a discount 
the effect will be to discourage acquisitions of more than of our common stock without negotiations with the board of directors of the company 
the rights will trade with our common stock  unless and until they are separated upon the occurrence of certain future events 
our board of directors may redeem the rights prior to the expiration of a specified period following the acquisition of more than of our common stock

the following discussion and the discussion in item a of this report under the heading risk factors describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to establish charles colvard as a reputable  high quality and sophisticated brand and position moissanite as a unique jewel  distinct from all others based on its exceptional fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
while we acknowledge that moissanite jewelry is sold as a gift and into the bridal and men s jewelry markets  moissanite is primarily marketed to the self purchasing woman as the perfect reward or indulgence for a woman celebrating her achievements or milestones in her life 
moissanite is also marketed to the jewelry trade as a new jewelry category with a unique business opportunity 
sales for were less than sales during we are disappointed with our sales and earnings results in  and our board of directors and management are taking actions to meet the short term challenges facing the company  while at the same time positioning the company to achieve improved long term results and increased shareholder value 
management believes the primary reasons for decreased sales in were lower replenishment orders resulting from high december  inventory levels at the retailers and a slower than planned sell through at the retail stores 
also contributing to our decrease in sales was the winding down of our relationship with one of our larger manufacturing customers who has decided to exit the moissanite business  the general sluggishness in the retail jewelry market  and higher gold prices resulting in higher retail jewelry prices 
we are confident in the future of moissanite as a fine jewelry category  but we are aware of the issues and challenges we face 
in an effort to more clearly identify strategic choices and opportunities  our board of directors has engaged the services of kanter international to provide a thorough review of our business strategy and model 
that work is in progress and our intention is to provide a report on our planned actions from that review when it is completed 
we currently expect to make that report in the second fiscal quarter of in the meantime  we plan to focus on the following for reducing our inventory and collecting outstanding accounts receivable  taking prudent cost containment steps and reducing overhead  capitalizing on the early success of our initiative to build independent retailer involvement in our category  working closely with our direct customers and retailers to remove any inventory overhang that exists  opportunistically executing programs to build our international revenue base  seeking other new distribution outlets that do not damage our important installed base of moissanite retailers  and working to return to consistent profitability 
during  we expanded distribution of moissanite jewelry to all kohl s doors  expanded our presence on tv shopping with hours at the home shopping network compared to hours in  
table of contents secured chain wide distribution at all stores with full service jewelry departments at belk doors and the army air force exchange system aafes doors and expanded our internet presence with amazon 
com 
based on test distribution of moissanite jewelry during and at gordon s  zales canada  and sears  these retailers will not have a moissanite jewelry program in while we did lose distribution at certain retailers during  the overall number of stores carrying moissanite has increased due to the kohl s rollout 
at december   chains with greater than stores that sell moissanite jewelry are jcpenney  finlay  kohl s  helzberg jewelers  aafes and belk 
our goal for is to grow revenue while being profitable by increasing awareness and demand for our jewel  moissanite 
our sales and marketing efforts will include  but not be limited to  increasing moissanite awareness  interest  and purchase intent at the consumer level  through consumer advertising  promotion  sponsorship and product placement opportunities  an expanded public relations effort  continuous sales training for the sales associates at the retail level  and individually tailored efforts for specific retailers 
results of operations the following table is intended to illustrate a tabular analysis of certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of sales for all periods presented 
a detailed explanation of our results of operations follows this table year ended december  net sales gross profit marketing sales expenses general administrative expenses operating income net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  decreased to approximately  carats from  carats 
the average selling price per carat remained the same for both periods 
us sales accounted for approximately and of sales during the year ended december  and  respectively 
us net sales and carat shipments  excluding consigned jewels  both decreased by for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  us sales decreased primarily due to lower replenishment orders resulting from high december  inventory levels at the retailers and a slower than planned sell through at the retail stores 
also contributing to our decrease in sales was the winding down of our relationship with one of our larger manufacturing customers who has decided to exit the moissanite business  the general sluggishness in the retail jewelry market  and higher gold prices resulting in higher retail jewelry prices 
our four largest customers during the year ended december   reeves park  sai  stuller  and k g creations accounted for   and  respectively  of our sales during as compared to   and  respectively  for we expect that we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our largest customers to maintain and enhance their retail programs 
a loss of any of these customer or retailer relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have terminated our relationship with k g creations effective january  we are currently working with the retailers previously supplied by k g creations to establish relationships with other moissanite jewelry manufacturers 
as those former retailers of k g creations transition to new manufacturers  we will likely see a short term negative impact on our results of operations

our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decreased gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by higher production costs in the first in  first out accounting period relieved from inventory in compared to the production costs for the related inventories sold in future gross profit margins will fluctuate based upon the costs being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy and our average selling price per carat 
assuming a similar product mix to that sold during and with possible fluctuations quarter to quarter  we expect our annual gross profit margin percentage for to be above  but lower than the margin achieved during the anticipated lower margins are the result of higher production costs during the period expected to be relieved from inventory during marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us  and is subject to the customer providing us documentation of all advertising copy that includes our products

we purchased million of raw material during management considers its investment in inventory essential to be able to meet the orders of its expanding customer base and to fulfill requests from our customers for consigned inventory 
our raw material inventories of sic crystals are purchased under exclusive supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers 
because the supply agreements restrict the sale of these crystals to only us  the suppliers negotiate minimum purchase commitments with us that may result in periodic levels of inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain 
these agreements coupled with lower than expected sales resulted in million of our inventories being classified as long term assets at december  on june   we entered into an amended and restated exclusive supply agreement with cree 
the exclusive supply agreement had an initial term of ten years that was extended in january to july in connection with the exclusive supply agreement  we have committed to purchase a minimum of by dollar volume of our requirements for sic crystals from cree

in addition  we have advanced  to norstel for the purchase of certain equipment 
this advance began to be repaid in january through a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals 
effective october   pursuant to the amended agreement with norstel  we began receiving a reduction on the invoice for subsequent purchases of sic crystals  and will continue to receive this reduction until the advance is repaid 
our current negotiations with norstel may result in a reduction of this percentage from the level 
the balance on the advance as of december  was  as of december   we had trade accounts receivable from our largest customer of million 
of this amount  million was past due 
we will continue shipping orders to this customer as long as they pay a specified amount higher than the amount of their new orders to us

in accordance with the hong kong tax code these amounts can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in hong kong 
as of december   there was approximately  in nol carryforwards in china 
in accordance with the china tax code these amounts can be carried forward five years to offset future taxable income in china

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation and classification of inventories  accounts receivable reserves  and co op advertising 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  
table of contents the most significant of which is our policy for revenue recognition  however  this policy typically does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our finished good inventories consist primarily of colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
moissanite jewels that do not meet our grading criteria and therefore are not deemed to be saleable are not included in inventories 
we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
as a result  our inventories do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
our distribution channels include two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  jewelry manufacturers  traditional retail stores  home shopping channels and catalogs 
consequently  significant amounts of inventories must be maintained at all times 
during  we established a lower of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
the reserve is necessary to allow for the carat weight loss during the re cutting process 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
since the establishment of this reserve  we have not yet re cut any jewels 
at december   the reserve remained at  estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
first  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem uncollectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
any accounts with significant balances are reviewed separately to determine an appropriate allowance based on the facts and circumstances of the specific account 
during our review for  we specifically reviewed and recorded an allowance for the balances owed to us by reeves park and k g creations 
the total allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the second reserve against accounts receivable is the allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company and considers any contractual return privileges granted to customers 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve in is primarily due to lower sales 
we offer a co op advertising program to many of our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
these amounts were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer  and the related contractual arrangements to provide certain levels of co op advertising for our customers 
the decrease in the amount was primarily due to lower sales and more of our customers submitting expenses to us for credit prior to the end of the year 
revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped 
our standard payment terms are generally between and days for jewel distributors and generally between to days for jewelry manufacturers 
in some circumstances  the company may extend terms of days 
some customers are required to prepay prior to shipment 
for all jewels shipped  title passes upon shipment of the jewels from our facility ie  fob shipping point 
periodically  the company sells jewels to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
our customers are generally required to make payments on memo shipments within days upon the customer informing the company that they will keep the jewels 
accordingly  the company does not recognize revenue on these memo transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that they will keep the jewels or the expiration of the right of return period 
all memo shipments are shown on our balance sheets as inventory on consignment

the majority of our transactions with international customers and suppliers are denominated in us dollars and  as such  we also do not believe that our exposure to fluctuations in any foreign currency exchange rate is material to our financial condition or results of operations
