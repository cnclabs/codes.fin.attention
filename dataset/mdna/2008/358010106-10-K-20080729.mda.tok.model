factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  inability to integrate operations and personnel  actions by significant customers or competitors  general domestic and international economic conditions  consumer spending trends  reliance on key customers  continued acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings 
by making these forward looking statements  the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to complete based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
see significant events below on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the other business segments  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating loss other income  net provision benefit for income taxes net income loss significant events operating results for fiscal year were impacted by activities on several major satellite payload programs 
revenues from space related programs increased by over from fiscal year but higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs as a result of testing failures encountered in the fourth quarter resulted in lower gross margin on certain contracts 
as a resresult  during the course of the company s year end closing process  management determined that the original estimate of expected costs to complete certain contracts as of april  were inadequate and had to be increased 
such estimate revisions resulted in a reduction of revenues reported in the statement of operations for the year ended april  and the recording of additional losses on certain contracts in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the company recorded an operating loss and negative operating cash flow for the year ended april  the company s management constantly monitors its estimates and intends to continually enhance its estimation process to enable the company to react more quickly to changing estimates and to reflect such changes in the applicable contracts and in the company s financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of of the outstanding shares of morion  reducing its investment in morion from to of morion s outstanding shares 
the company received approximately million from the sale and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
net sales years ended april  in millions change fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales for the year ended april   the revenue increase in the fei ny segment and the increase in the fei zyfer segment were derived from two primary market areas satellite payloads both commercial and us government programs and other us government  non space programs 
revenues from these sources each increased by over from year ago levels 
satellite payload programs are managed by the fei ny segment and both fei ny and fei zyfer provide products to non space us government programs 
telecommunication network revenues  generated by all three segments  was lower by less than from the fiscal year levels as customer demand softened 
gillam fei revenues also benefited from the increased value of the euro compared to the us dollar 
in euro denominated terms and excluding intersegment sales  gillam fei fiscal year revenues declined by from the prior year 
for the year ended april   revenue in the fei ny segment increased by over the prior year 
wireless telecommunications related revenues  revenues from satellite payloads for commercial and us government programs  other us government  non space programs and other commercial revenues all increased as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gillam fei revenues in fiscal exclusive of intercompany sales of million related to increased inventory for and development efforts expended on the new wireline synchronization product line increased by 
approximately one fourth of the sales increase is attributable to the increased value of the euro compared to the us dollar 
revenues for the fei zyfer segment during fiscal year declined by million as many orders were delayed compared to expectations 
during fiscal year  based on current backlog and significant bookings subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company expects to realize significant revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs 
in addition  the company s recent work on us government sponsored development contracts and current proposal activity should generate increased revenues from us government programs such as secure radios  unmanned aerial vehicles  weapons guidance systems and secure communications 
the timing and magnitude of revenues from these sources is dependent on the us government s procurement and budgeting process 
increased us government spending during fiscal year is expected to benefit the company s fei ny and fei zyfer segment 
in addition  in late fiscal year  the company began booking orders for its new  state of the art wireline synchronization systems 
the company expects to see increased bookings and revenues in fiscal year which would benefit both the fei ny and gillam fei segments 
gross margin rates years ended april  in thousands change gm rate for the year ended april   total gross margin increased as a result of the increase in revenues but declined as a percentage of revenues 
the rate decrease is primarily the result of higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload programs 
throughout fiscal year  the company s satellite payload business continued to reconfigure its manufacturing processes to provide increased production capacity for the higher demand for space related assemblies 
late in the year  the company also experienced higher than expected costs on two late stage programs in final assembly and test of flight hardware 
these expenses not only increased cost of sales but also delayed the recognition of revenue on the contracts  which are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  further reducing gross margins 
the two late stage programs are expected to be completed in the first few months of fiscal the gross margin rates in the telecommunications and non space us government business areas met the company s targets for these areas which range from to 
for the year ended april   gross margin declined both in total and as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year 
this is primarily the result of higher than anticipated engineering costs on certain satellite payload programs 
the company encountered a significant learning curve in its efforts to increase its production capacity of certain space related assemblies by a factor of during fiscal year  substantial resources were expended in late stage assembly and testing of the company s products to meet the specific requirements of two long term contracts 
this process also delayed the completion of these contracts which occurred in early fiscal year the company s target is to achieve an overall gross margin rate of or better through greater sales volume  continued process improvements  better performance on long term contracts and utilization of lower cost manufacturing in china 
during fiscal year  as the more challenging satellite programs are completed and are replaced by substantial cost plus programs  the company expects to realize increasing gross margin rates approaching its targeted rate 
selling and administrative expenses years ended april  in thousands change fiscal year selling and administrative costs increased over fiscal year principally from higher medical expenses  normal salary increases  higher deferred compensation expense  increased marketing expenses for new products and the cost of moving the company s california facility to larger leased space and the related increased rent expense 
also  in euro denominated terms  selling and administrative expenses at gillam fei were comparable to the prior year but when denominated in us dollars  increased by in fiscal year due to the declining value of the dollar 
for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
fiscal year selling and administrative costs increased over fiscal year principally from higher compensation expense related to an increase in personnel  normal salary increases  higher deferred compensation expense and partially offset by lower incentive compensation charges due to operating losses recorded during the year 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
for fiscal year  the company expects to achieve its targeted level of selling and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses years ended april  in thousands change research and development expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
for the prior fiscal year ended april   r d spending was at a greater than normal level as a direct result of internally funded projects to enhance the company s product offerings for satellite payloads and to design such products for more efficient production 
some of that effort continued into fiscal year but at a lower rate 
in addition  during early fiscal year  the company completed development of its new usg wireline synchronization product and the upgrade of its gps based synchronization product line 
r d spending was and of consolidated revenues in fiscal years and  respectively  exceeding the company s target of of revenues for such efforts 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will continue to make investments in improved satellite payload products  develop and improve miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of low g oscillators 
the company will also be engaged in development efforts that are funded by its customers  the results of which will enhance its own product offerings 
thus  the company s target for fiscal year is to spend less than of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating loss years ended april  in thousands change as discussed above  the operating losses incurred in fiscal years and are the result of lower gross margin and higher research and development spending  both of which are due to higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs incurred in connection with the company s satellite payload products and programs 
the company expects to realize substantially improved operating profits in fiscal year as earlier large volume satellite programs are completed and are augmented by new  large cost plus programs 
with recent satellite and wireline telecommunication bookings  the company expects to report improved gross margins while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
other income expense years ended april  in thousands change investment income equity loss income interest expense other income  net investment income in fiscal year includes net gains on sales of investments of million which includes the million gain on the partial sale of the company s investment in morion  as indicated above 
by comparison  in fiscal year  the company recorded net losses on the sale of marketable securities of approximately  investment income also includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
income from this source was approximately  in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year as a result of lower interest rates after the redemption of certain marketable securities in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company will realize investment income primarily from interest on its bond portfolio and anticipates that the amount earned will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recorded equity loss from its interest in elcom 
in fiscal year  equity income also included the company s share of income earned by morion 
subsequent to the reduction in the company s interest in morion from to in early fiscal year  the company records its morion investment on the cost basis and does not include any share of morion s earnings in the company s financial statements 
in fiscal year  the company s share of morion s earnings exceeded its share of elcom s losses 
in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations and on certain deferred compensation obligations 
in fiscal year  the company also entered into a capital lease for equipment 
for the year ended april   interest expense increased over the prior year due to greater utilization of its bank line of credit to cover working capital requirements 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will decrease as it repays the bank line of credit through improved cash flow from operating activities 
during both fiscal years and  the company recognized  of income from amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of its corporate headquarters building in new york  which income is included in the caption other income  net 
the deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the original eleven year lease 
also  in fiscal year  other income included a realized gain of approximately  from the excess of proceeds over the cash values of life insurance policies on the lives of two former employees 
other income is partially offset by certain nonrecurring expenses 
in fiscal year  other income  net will include amortization into income of the final  of deferred gain on the sale of its building 
the company anticipates that in future years other items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states and in europe 
the fiscal year tax gain on the partial sale of the morion investment is greater than the gain recorded for financial reporting purposes  resulting in a higher than expected effective tax rate of 
in fiscal year  the tax benefit derived from carrying forward that year s tax loss and unapplied tax credits as well as the reversal of a portion of a reserve on foreign taxes  resulted in effective tax benefit rate greater than 
the effective rate is also impacted by the income or loss of certain of the company s european and asian subsidiaries which are currently not taxed 
the company may commence tax payments in china during calendar based on the operating profits of its subsidiary  fei asia 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
the fiscal year operating loss carryforwards for the us subsidiaries of the company will be used to offset taxable income in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments but offset by million in borrowings under its bank line of credit 
the company s current ratio at april  is to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to million used in operations in fiscal year the primary causes for the decrease in cash was the operating loss generated by higher operating expenses and a increase in accounts receivable  including an increase of over million in unbilled receivables 
unbilled receivables arise when the company recognizes revenues at different intervals than the related milestone billings under long term contracts  primarily related to satellite payload programs 
the timing for such billings is determined by the contract terms which the company must meet in order to invoice its customers 
under long term contract accounting the company recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion basis as measured by the ratio of actual costs to estimated program costs 
such revenue recognition often results in recording receivables for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings or unbilled receivables 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
in fiscal year  the company anticipates that it will generate positive cash flow from operations by realizing operating profits and as certain long term contracts are completed and are replaced by large  cost plus programs 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended april   was approximately million compared to million in the prior year 
the fiscal year increase was primarily due to the receipt of approximately million upon the partial sale of the company s investment in morion and the sale or redemption of certain marketable securities  net of purchases of other marketable securities  which generated approximately million
