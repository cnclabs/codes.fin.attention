item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to stock based compensation  inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal year  the company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  stock option cost is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes valuation model requires the company to estimate key assumptions such as expected option term  stock price volatility  dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to its results of operations 
in addition  sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
the company estimates forfeitures based on its historical activity  as it believes these forfeiture rates to be indicative of its expected forfeiture rate 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
the company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand 
the company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability  obsolescence  historical experience and current business conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  the company may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes approximately of net revenues from domestic distributors that are recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of pricing rebates  the ultimate sales price on domestic distributor sales transactions is not fixed or determinable until domestic distributors sell the merchandise to the end user 
at the time of shipment to domestic distributors  the company records a trade receivable and deferred revenue at the distributor purchasing price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay for the products delivered 
the company relieves inventory as title has passed to the distributor and recognizes deferred cost of sales in the same amount 
deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the difference between deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales and is recognized as a current liability until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
at june   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue and million of deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipment to distributors 
at july   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue and million of deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipment to distributors 
to the extent the company was to have a significant reduction in distributor price or grant significant price rebates  there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross profit recognized 
the price rebates that have been remitted back to distributors have ranged from million to million per quarter 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company has reserves to cover expected product returns 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations  the company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns 
generally  changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as the company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
the company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
for a discussion of current tax matters  see note income taxes in part ii  item of this form k 
results of operations the table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount 
fiscal year ended percentage change june  july  july  over over revenues cost of sales gross profit expenses research development selling  general administrative operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes effective tax rates the results for fiscal years and were impacted by the company entering into a billion accelerated stock repurchase asr transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the asr transaction was funded by billion of the company s own cash and billion of convertible debt 
as a result  the company s fiscal year and to a lesser extent fiscal year results have both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense which resulted in income before income taxes as a percentage of revenues to be lower than past results 
shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share eps decreased by million or approximately due to the asr 
the billion asr transaction along with the increase in revenues drove the significant increase in earnings per share during fiscal year consequently  the asr transaction has been accretive to eps  as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the reduction in net income from higher interest expense and lower interest income

gross profit for the fiscal year ended july  was million  a decrease of million or from gross profit of million in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to of revenues in fiscal year as compared to of revenues in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year was primarily due to increases in costs related to stock based compensation of million and spreading fixed costs over a lower revenue base 
these decreases were partially offset by lower profit sharing

in addition  the effective tax rate is higher due to lower tax exempt interest income and the expiration of the eti export tax benefit when compared to fiscal year offsetting these increases to the effective tax rate was an increase in foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions  higher domestic production tax benefits and the impact of quarterly discrete adjustments

as a result  the company s fiscal year results have both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense when compared to the previous fiscal year 
however  shares used in the calculation of diluted eps decreased by million or approximately due to the asr 
consequently  the asr transaction has been accretive to eps  as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the reduction in net income from higher interest expense and lower interest income  and this  coupled with the increase in revenues caused the increase in eps 
factors affecting future operating results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this annual report on form k  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors  among others  as the timing  volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter  timely ramp up of new facilities  the timely introduction of new processes and products  increases in costs associated with utilities  transportation and raw materials  currency fluctuations  the effects of adverse economic conditions in the united states and international markets and other factors described below and in item a risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
the company met its guidance set at the beginning of the june quarter by growing revenues and eps over the march quarter 
the company has grown revenues and eps for five consecutive quarters in a difficult economic environment 
the company s strategy of diversification by geography and end market  emphasizing more traditional linear technology end markets  contributed to the company s record annual revenues and eps 
looking ahead  given the concerns about the economic difficulties particularly in the usa  forecasting future results continues to be a challenge 
while the company had a positive book to bill ratio for the june quarter  the september quarter is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication infrastructure businesses 
however  the company expects the september quarter to have some strength in certain high end consumer end markets 
consequently  the company presently estimates that revenues and income before taxes in the september quarter will be flat to up sequentially from the june quarter 
estimates of future performance are uncertain  and past performance of the company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the company  its competitors  the semiconductor industry and the overall economy 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  cyclical market patterns  periodic oversupply conditions  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
furthermore  new product introductions and patent protection of existing products  as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the company  are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability 
although the company believes that it has the product lines  manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations  sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors 
additionally  the company s common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community 
furthermore  stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
liquidity and capital resources at june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and working capital was  million

the company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters 
income taxes payable totaled million at the end of fiscal year  a decrease of million from the fourth quarter of fiscal year primarily due to the reclassification of million in unrecognized tax benefits to other long term liabilities as a result of the implementation of fin during the first quarter of fiscal year this effect was partially offset by the net of quarterly tax payments and the company s tax provision 
other accrued liabilities of million increased million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year primarily due to an increase in accrued legal costs 
deferred tax liabilities totaled million at the end of fiscal year  an increase of million over the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes related to interest deductions for the company s convertible senior debt 
other long term liabilities of million increased million over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the unrecognized tax benefit reclassification of million noted above and due to the implementation of eitf  which resulted in a million increase for accrued sabbaticals
