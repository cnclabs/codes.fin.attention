gmc which does business as herley farmingdale  were notified of the company s intent to close the herley farmingdale facility 
despite our efforts to update and improve the farmingdale operations  the facility has continued to report losses and has been the single largest contributor to our poor operating performance 
accordingly  management decided to close our manufacturing facility in farmingdale  new york as quickly as possible and transfer the bulk of its workload to our other facilities in whippany  new jersey  woburn  massachusetts  lancaster  pennsylvania  and jerusalem  israel 
a transition plan is well underway which transfers contract activity and assets to other herley businesses and also reduces the workforce as the activity at farmingdale decreases 
it is expected that the closure of the facility will be substantially completed by the end of december the lease obligations at the facility extend to august the major cost associated with the restructuring are one time termination benefits which are estimated at approximately million 
the costs are being accrued evenly from may through december costs accrued during the fourth quarter approximated  and charges against the liability for one time termination benefits paid approximated  the liability for the one time termination benefits was approximately  as of august  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement asset agreement dated as of august  to acquire the business and certain assets subject to the assumption of certain liabilities of eyal microwave industries emi a privately held israeli company for cash of  emi is a leading supplier of a broad range of innovative  high reliability rf  microwave and millimeter wave components and customized subsystems for the global defense industry 
based in kibbutz eyal  israel  the company has approximately employees 
emi includes eyal microwave ltd 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  eyal mag ltd 
funding for the purchase was provided through a million loan under the company s existing credit facility through its current bank and a term loan in the amount of million for a period of years through the company s bank in israel 
the new loan is payable in quarterly installments over a period of years with interest at libor plus 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the provisions of sfas in september  management executed an agreement the agreement with a foreign defense company to divest our ici subsidiary located in mclean  virginia 
ici is a communications technology development firm specializing in research  design  development  production  and support of wireless data communications products and services 
the agreement provides for an all cash transaction valued at approximately million and includes a significant contingency requiring us government approval on or before november  or the agreement will be void 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the us government approval will be granted and the transaction will be completed 
in the event the transaction is completed  ici will be reported as a discontinued operation and a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million would be recorded to reflect the difference between the sale price pursuant to the agreement and the net carrying value of the assets held for sale 
in fiscal  ici reported revenues of approximately million and operating income of approximately million 
the ici balance sheet includes total assets of approximately million  including approximately million of allocated goodwill  and liabilities of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the us government will grant approval so that the transaction will be completed

fiscal compared to fiscal our company s senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics as well as the status of operating initiatives 
we review information on the financial performance of the operations  new business opportunities  customer relationships and initiatives  ir d activities  human resources  manufacturing effectiveness  cost reduction activities  as well as other subjects 
we compare performance against budget  against prior comparable periods  and against our most recent internal forecasts

we believe the overall prospects for our financial performance continues to be promising 
our backlog remains at high levels while our proposal activity continues to be very active 
the poor financial performance in fiscal was driven largely by engineering and manufacturing difficulties on a number of significant and important contracts  including development contracts  as well as litigation settlement costs 
we understand the various technical problems we are facing and are progressing with action plans to resolve them 
in addition  the operational issues are being carefully  but aggressively addressed  as evidenced in part by the closing of our farmingdale manufacturing facility 
although there can be no assurance that we will succeed  we believe the business is showing improvement and we are confident that we will continue to successfully work through these challenges 
during fiscal  a number of operational improvement initiatives have been undertaken at our operating facilities which have demonstrated operational performance improvement which is expected to continue into future periods 
we established four improvement objectives across all locations improve cycle time  reduce defects  improve customer satisfaction  and increase herley pride 
we motivated our employees to actively engage in this program 
across all our locations  we have more than active teams addressing specific improvement objectives aligned with these four corporate objectives 
we are also emphasizing a culture of honoring our commitments in everything we do 
we continue to see this process improvement culture taking root in our operations 
although we believe that our expectations for the success of these initiatives are reasonable  there are no guarantees that future results  performance or achievements may be realized 
similarly  we formed five councils which are technology  operations  business development  finance  and contracts 
each council has a representative from each of our locations and is chartered with the objective of implementing process improvements in their respective discipline that crosses all locations as well as sharing of best practices across herley 
significant accomplishments were achieved by the councils during fiscal and efforts are underway on their initiatives for fiscal in addition  we continue to identify and implement specific and substantive actions to control costs and focus the resources of the company directly on operational performance issues designed to bring about measurable and sustainable improvement 
accordingly  we believe we are taking appropriate and aggressive actions to meet the challenges facing our company and we remain optimistic that the company s performance issues experienced during fiscal will be short lived 
fifty three weeks ended august  and fifty two weeks ended july  net sales for the fifty three weeks ended august  were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net sales is primarily related to o a decrease of approximately million at innovative concepts primarily due to a delays in booking and a reduction in scope for certain cost plus fixed fee contracts for software development and b a decrease in deliveries due to the completion of a contract for radio communication equipment  o delays in key microwave development and production programs at herley farmingdale of approximately million  o a decrease in revenue of approximately million versus the prior year as certain commercial programs ended and the transition towards military business progressed at herley cti  o a decrease at herley medical products of approximately million in sales to two key commercial customers due to timing of their customers capital purchasing requirements  and o disruptions across several production programs due to supplier quality issues 
offsetting these decreases was o an increase of million of simulation systems and other product sales through micro systems  inc  o an increase of approximately million at herley new england due to volume of certain key second generation production programs  and o an increase in revenue on various programs and products across multiple sites 
domestic and foreign sales were and respectively of net sales in fiscal versus and respectively in the prior fiscal year 
bookings were approximately million  and were domestic and foreign 
this compares to bookings of approximately million in the prior year period which were domestic and foreign 
gross profit in the fifty three weeks ended august  was million of net sales compared to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of million 
contributing to the reduction in gross profit during fiscal are the following items o higher independent research and development costs of approximately million on investments in certain strategic opportunities at several herley operations  o approximately million in contract losses recognized on two development and production contracts at herley farmingdale  o higher costs at our israeli subsidiary due to the unfavorable exchange rate of the us dollar versus the new israeli shekel reduced gross margins by approximately million  o reduced volume of revenues across several herley operations affected gross margin by approximately million  o approximately million at herley farmingdale due to cost overruns and a change in management s estimate of the recoverability of the costs on future contracts  o disruptions across several production programs due to supplier quality issues  increased costs of production  and o product mix of contracts both domestically and internationally 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty three weeks ended august  were million as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in representative commissions related largely to our international business 
we believe we are entitled to recovery of certain legal fees under our d o insurance policy associated with the matters discussed in part  item  legal proceedings 
as of august   we have aggregate claims of approximately  net of a deductible of  and have received partial payments of approximately  we have entered into an agreement dated january  with the insurance carrier whereby if it is determined by final decision of an arbitration panel  or by final judgment of a court  or other final decision of a tribunal having jurisdiction thereof  that any amount paid by the insurance carrier was not a loss  as that term is defined in the policy  we shall repay to the insurance carrier any such uncovered sums previously advanced to us 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the insurance carrier asserted in a letter their determination that they are not liable for certain of the legal costs incurred by us 
we have responded with a letter  supported by court case citations  that all the submitted costs represent valid claims under the policy and that the insurance company is liable 
however  based on the insurance company s position and generally accepted accounting principles we are not permitted to record any potential claim for recovery under our insurance policy 
accordingly  the previously recorded receivable of  as of may  has been eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal while there are no assurances  we believe such costs represent a loss under our d o policy and such costs are recoverable 
we had an operating loss during fiscal of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal the results of fiscal include both the million settlement of the department of justice litigation and the million settlement of the eads litigation as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements as well as related legal expenses of million 
the decrease in operating income before the legal expenses  litigation settlements and employment contract settlement costs is attributable to the reduction in sales volume  the decrease in gross margin as discussed above  and the increase in selling and administrative 
investment income was million  a decrease of million in fiscal because of lower average cash balances through portions of the year 
interest expense was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year comparable period 
we recognized a net foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal year compared to a foreign exchange transaction gain of million in fiscal the foreign exchange losses and gains are attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency of our us subsidiary primarily in connection with temporary advances we have made to them in us dollars 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal was million representing an effective income tax benefit rate of  as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to the net operating loss for the company for fiscal year as compared to overall income for the company for fiscal year the benefit exceeds the statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of fin liabilities of approximately million that are no longer needed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for an earlier tax year in which an uncertain tax position had been taken 
another major component to the benefit was the tax on the non deductible penalty paid as part of the litigation settlement  which reduced the benefit by 
basic and diluted loss per common share for the fifty three weeks ended august  were 
each as compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of 
each for the fifty two weeks ended july  fiscal compared to fiscal the four month suspension june october from receiving new contract awards from the us government at some of our operations caused disruption in our business in several respects which cannot be easily measured  but certainly had an impact on the results of operations in fiscal both in terms of sales and profitability 
while the effects of the suspension were evident during the first quarter  they continued during the second quarter and to a lesser degree in the third quarter due to delays in bookings 
the fourth quarter was affected by the second suspension on june  but the impact on the fourth quarter performance was not significant 
net sales for the fifty two weeks ended july  were approximately million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net sales is partly related to the recording of a million claim receivable on a major program during the first quarter of the prior year 
in addition  there was a net decline of million in microwave systems and assemblies in our domestic operations primarily due to the completion of certain contracts and the timing of shipments  some of which was due to the delays in bookings during the suspension period 
sales of simulation systems at ewst declined million due to the completion of certain contracts and the cyclical nature of its business 
commercial sales of medical products were slightly higher  while commercial sales at herley cti decreased million as certain commercial programs ended and the transition towards military business progressed 
offsetting these decreases were million of increased sales at herley israel of both microwave systems and microwave products 
domestic and foreign sales were and respectively of net sales in fiscal  versus and respectively in fiscal the gross profit margin in the fifty two weeks ended july  was compared to in fiscal  a decline of 
contributing to the reduction in the gross profit percentage during fiscal are the following items o the booking of the million claim receivable in fiscal o disruptions caused by the four month suspension from receiving new contract awards from the u 
s 
government at some of our operations 
o startup production costs on certain programs 
o product mix of contracts domestically and internationally 
offset by o revisions in the accrual for contract losses on existing contracts based on current estimates 
the accrual for contract losses associated with the ici acquisition more fully described in note b of form k for the fiscal year ended july  was reduced by  in the fifty two weeks ended july  which is included as a reduction of costs of products sold as a result of changes in the estimated liability for expected losses under the contract 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended july  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal the increase in costs as a percentage of sales is due to the lower net sales in fiscal selling and administrative costs declined year to year by  increases and decreases are as follows o stock compensation costs recorded in fiscal per sfas r of million  of which approximately million was related to the employment contract for the chief operating officer 
this is an increase of million versus fiscal where the stock compensation costs were million 
offset by o legal costs  net of estimated insurance recoveries  were million in fiscal  a decrease of million versus fiscal the majority of the legal costs relate to the defense of the company associated with the recent indictment 
o a net decrease of approximately million in commission costs across several businesses due to the mix and timing of specific orders 
we believe we are entitled to recovery of certain legal fees associated with the recent indictment and class action complaints under our d o insurance policy 
accordingly  as of july   we have a receivable of  net of a deductible of  and a payment received of  on june  in anticipation of recoveries and the amount is included in other receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at july  the insurance carrier may contest the claim in whole or in part 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement dated january  with the insurance carrier whereby if it is determined by final decision of an arbitration panel  or by final judgment of a court  or other final decision of a tribunal having jurisdiction thereof  that any amount paid by the insurance carrier was not a loss  as that term is defined in the policy  we shall repay to the insurance carrier any such uncovered sums previously advanced to us 
employment contract settlement costs of approximately million relate to an agreement effective october  with the company s co founder and former chairman  to terminate his employment agreement with us after years of service 
settlement costs include a cash payment of million paid upon the effective date of the settlement agreement  payments due under a promissory note and estimated medical and life insurance benefits discounted at an imputed interest rate of  plus the fair value of a modification to the stock options held by him using the black scholes option valuation model 
we had operating income for fiscal of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding the employment contract settlement costs of million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  operating income for fiscal would have been million or of net sales  as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the lower sales volume 
our foreign operations contributed approximately million in operating income for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal investment income was  an increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of interest earned on higher cash balances 
interest expense was  an increase of  as compared to the prior year primarily due to the imputed interest expense related to the employment settlement agreement  as well as interest expense relating to financing the implementation of the erp software package 
we recognized a net foreign exchange gain of  in fiscal  versus a gain of  in fiscal these foreign exchange gains are attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency of our uk subsidiary primarily in connection with temporary advances we have made to them in us dollars 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal was  representing a negative effective tax rate of  as compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decline in the effective income tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to a the extension of the r d tax credit by congress in december retroactive to january   b an increase in the proportion of overall earnings generated through the company s foreign operations where earnings are taxed at lower rates than domestically  and c the elimination of certain tax accruals that are no longer deemed necessary 
the extension of the r d tax credit reduced the statutory income tax rate of by an estimated for fiscal as a result of lower domestic earnings  due primarily to the employment contract settlement costs which significantly affects domestic profitability  foreign earnings are a greater percentage of total earnings 
the company s foreign earnings are attributable primarily to our israeli subsidiary which is taxed at an estimated rate of for fiscal thereby reducing the effective income tax rate by approximately 
the elimination of certain tax reserves that are no longer deemed necessary reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 
other benefits included research and development credits prior to december   tax benefits attributable to extra territorial income ie export sales  the section manufacturing deduction  the benefit of stock compensation costs  and tax exempt interest income 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the fifty two weeks ended july  were 
per common share each as compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of 
and  respectively  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we believe that presently anticipated future cash requirements will be provided by internally generated funds  our existing unsecured credit facility and existing cash balances 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal will be generated from our existing backlog of sales orders 
the funded backlog of orders at august  was approximately million of which approximately is expected to ship in fiscal all orders included in this backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in our backlog  we will be required to rely more heavily on cash balances and our existing credit facility to fund our operations 
we are not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of our government contracts

the intent of fas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations  and other generally accepted accounting principles 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and only applies prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this statement will have on our consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to provide enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities in order to better convey the purpose of derivative use in terms of risk management 
disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  are required 
this statement retains the same scope as sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas no 
i establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value  ii sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements  and iii requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued staff positions fsps no 
and no 
 which  respectively  remove leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no 
and defer its effective date for one year relative to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
as a result  the application of the definition of fair value and related disclosures of sfas no 
as impacted by these two fsps will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  on a prospective basis with respect to fair value measurements of a nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually and b all financial assets and liabilities 
the remaining aspects of sfas no 
for which the effective date was deferred under fsp no 
are currently being evaluated by us and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  areas impacted by the deferral relate to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value  but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
this deferral applies to such items as nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods or nonfinancial long lived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment 
the effects of sfas no 
and fsps no 
and no 
are currently being evaluated by us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination 
specifically  it establishes principles and requirements over how the acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and  determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
sfas r would have an impact on accounting for any businesses acquired after the effective date of this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary minority interests and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas also requires that a retained noncontrolling interest upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at its fair value 
upon adoption of sfas  we would be required to report any noncontrolling interests as a separate component of shareholders equity 
we would also be required to present any net income allocable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to our shareholders separately in our consolidated statements of income 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  our fiscal year 
sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests  and would have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of the noncontrolling interest of any non wholly owned businesses acquired in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies contained in part ii  item of this form k 
as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of our financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
approximately of our contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
approximately to of revenues over the last three fiscal years were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated contract costs at completion with related cost of sales recorded as costs are incurred 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the period in which the change is known 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the final costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
using a fair value approach applied to our single reporting unit 
impairment charges are recognized for amounts where the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
any future impairment of goodwill will be charged to operations 
we amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
amortizable intangible assets may also be tested for impairment if indications of impairment exist 
an impairment test based on a single reporting unit was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal using our current market capitalization  which in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
based on this initial step in the test for impairment  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of august  effective august   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
this standard requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
the cost is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the options 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation costs includes a compensation cost of stock options granted prior to but not yet vested as of august  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all options granted subsequent to july  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas r 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of share based awards is based on observed historical exercise patterns for our employees 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in the uk prior to fiscal  the movements in the new israeli shekel versus the us dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
for fiscal years   and  herley israel accounts for approximately to of our consolidated net sales 
a significant portion of the revenues are derived from dollar denominated contracts  however costs at herley israel are largely based in new israeli shekels which exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future new israeli shekel denominated costs and earnings 
a strengthening in the average value of new israeli shekels in fiscal  for example  would have increased costs by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated loss before income taxes by approximately  the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were   and respectively 
a strengthening in the average value of new israeli shekels in fiscal  for example  would have increased costs by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated income from operations before income taxes by approximately  the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were   and respectively 
for fiscal years  and  ewst accounts for approximately to of our consolidated net sales based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been converted into us dollars 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated loss from operations before income taxes by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated operating income by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss

we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million at august  and million at july  since the advances are denominated in us dollars and ewst anticipates reducing the amount of advances during fiscal year  the amount outstanding is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note g of the financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a ten year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of august  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
on april   the company replaced its existing credit facility with a new million revolving credit loan agreement agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions and stand by letters of credit

there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility payable quarterly 
stand by letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of approximately million at august  see note e 
if at any time the company s backlog of orders falls below million  the bank may obtain a security interest in eligible accounts receivable  as defined  and if the outstanding advances are greater than of eligible receivables  a lien on all inventories 
funded backlog as of august  was approximately million 
a loan of  was outstanding under the line at august  there were no borrowings under the line at july  the table below provides information about our debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates
