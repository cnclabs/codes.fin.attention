risk factors 
our business is subject to a number of risks 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide whether to purchase our common stock 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible  and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares 
any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities 
consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition  results of operations and trading price at the present time 
we are dependent on certain key personnel 
we are dependent on the services of ian m 
cumming and joseph s 
steinberg  our chairman of the board and president  respectively 
messrs 
cumming s and steinberg s employment agreements with us expire june  these individuals are also significant shareholders of our company 
as of february   messrs 
cumming and steinberg and trusts for the benefit of their respective families excluding certain private charitable foundations beneficially owned approximately and of our outstanding common shares  respectively 
accordingly  messrs 
cumming and steinberg exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and would be adversely affected by a recession 
a worsening of general economic or market conditions may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets 
declines in the us housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of the manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so 
our manufacturing operations are subject to risks associated with increased volatility in raw material prices and availability of key raw materials 
if the price for our raw materials continues to increase and we are not able to pass these price increases to our customers  or we are unable to obtain key raw materials  our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
sti prepaid may not be able to obtain sufficient or cost effective termination capacity to particular destinations 
this could result in an inability to fulfill customer demands or in higher costs  which could adversely affect revenues and margins 
pricing on sti prepaid s prepaid phone card business is highly sensitive to price declines and subject to intense competition 
we believe in some instances our competitors offer or appear to offer rates to consumers that are below their cost in order to gain market share 
this type of pricing by one or more of our competitors can adversely affect our revenues and profits 
sti prepaid relies on independent distributors to generate revenues  who may not devote sufficient efforts to promote and sell our products rather than the products of our competitors 
the hard rock biloxi is a new business with no operating history  and premier does not have any experience operating a gaming facility 
if premier is unable to manage the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  it would negatively impact operating results 
increases in mortgage interest rate levels or decreases in available consumer credit could reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects 
the company s current and future investment in sangart is subject to certain regulatory risks and costs  as well as risks associated with the operation of a new business without a proven track record 
sangart s activities are subject to extensive government regulation and sangart cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products 
sangart is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business 
sangart s hemospan product is subject to competition from other products under development 
there are other companies developing products for the same market that sangart is targeting  and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before sangart it may significantly impair sangart s ability to compete in the same market segment 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring hemospan to market would be adversely affected  it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
goober drilling s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace 
during periods of decreased demand for natural gas  goober drilling s rig utilization will decline and its competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace  which would adversely impact goober drilling s revenues and profitability 
the company has a substantial investment in acf  a company that makes automobile loans to sub prime and other borrowers 
if acf s loan losses increase or its ability to make new loans and grow its business is impaired  its revenues and profits would decline  adversely affecting the value of the company s investment 
the company has substantial investments in fortescue  inmet and clc  entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals principally iron ore and copper  the prices of which have recently been at record levels 
if these prices decline or delays occur in bringing the mines into production  the value of the company s investments would decline 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses 
from time to time we are subject to litigation  for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  adverse determinations in specific legal matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset 
at december   we have recognized a deferred tax asset of  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the deferred tax asset 
we may not be able to insure certain risks economically 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common shares 
on a split adjusted basis  we paid cash dividends of per common share in and and per common share in however  we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common shares in the future or  if we do  the amount of such dividends 
the payment of dividends on our common shares in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon general business conditions  the availability of our nols  legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors may deem to be relevant 
in connection with the declaration of dividends or the making of distributions on  or the purchase  redemption or other acquisition of our common shares  we are required to comply with certain restrictions contained in certain of our debt instruments 
our common shares are subject to transfer restrictions 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have significant nols and other tax attributes  the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes  our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership including through attribution under the tax law of or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the restriction will remain until the earliest of a december   b the repeal of section of the internal revenue code or any comparable successor provision and c the beginning of our taxable year to which these tax attributes may no longer be carried forward 
the restriction may be waived by our board of directors 
shareholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common shares and consult their own legal advisors and or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level

as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies  the income tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately  for   for   for and  for item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources parent company liquidity leucadia national corporation the parent is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents and other non controlling investments in debt and equity securities 
the parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value 
accordingly  further acquisitions  divestitures  investments and changes in capital structure are possible 
its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources  liquid investments  bank borrowings  public and private capital market transactions  repayment of subsidiary advances  funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments  management and other fees  and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs 
securities classified as current and non current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents  but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a short period of time 
as of december   the sum of these amounts aggregated  however  since  of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements  represents investments in non public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements which restrict the company s ability to use the funds for other purposes including the inmet shares  the company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the parent s liquidity needs 
the  that is available is comprised of cash and short term bonds and notes of the us government and its agencies  us government sponsored enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities including the investment in fortescue common shares discussed below 
the investment income realized from the parent s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the parent company s short term recurring cash requirements  which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses 
the parent s only long term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long term debt  principal outstanding as of december   of which  is due in   is due in   is due in   is due in and  is due in historically  the parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments  but  except as disclosed in this report  the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted 
should the company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose  the parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of  that matures in and bears interest based on the eurocurrency rate or the prime rate 
no amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility 
in addition  based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers  the company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities 
the parent s senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by moody s investors services and one level below investment grade by standard poor s and fitch ratings 
ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time 
in march  sti prepaid purchased of the assets of telco for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  including expenses 
the acquisition cost was principally allocated to components of working capital and to deferred tax assets  including a reduction to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance of  in march  the company invested an additional  in sangart increasing its ownership interest to approximately principally to fund sangart s ongoing product development activities 
the company also received warrants for the right but not the obligation to invest up to an additional  on the same terms  which if fully invested would increase its ownership interest to approximately 
the company expects to exercise the warrants in in june  the company completed the acquisition of resortquest for  including expenses and working capital adjustments finalized subsequent to the closing date 
as discussed above  on august   premier emerged from chapter bankruptcy proceedings and once again became a consolidated subsidiary of the company 
premier was initially accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when it was acquired during  however  premier was deconsolidated on september   when it filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under the bankruptcy code  before the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
premier filed its petitions in order to seek the court s assistance in gaining access to hurricane katrina related insurance proceeds which had been denied to premier by its pre petition secured bondholders 
while in bankruptcy proceedings the company s investment and loans to premier were accounted for as an investment in an associated company  as of december  
premier s plan was funded in part with a  senior secured credit facility provided by a subsidiary of the company 
the credit facility matures on february   bears interest at  is prepayable at any time without penalty  and contains other covenants  terms and conditions similar to those contained in the indenture governing the premier notes 
since the plan did not result in any change in ownership of the voting interests in premier  the company did not apply fresh start accounting and did not treat the reconsolidation of premier as the acquisition of a business that  under the purchase method of accounting  requires the measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value 
accordingly  the company reconsolidated the assets and liabilities of premier upon its emergence from bankruptcy using its historical basis in premier s assets and liabilities 
the plan provided for the payment in full of all of premier s creditors  including payment of principal and accrued interest due to the holders of premier s senior secured notes at par the premier notes 
the holders of the premier notes argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the premier notes  and as such are entitled to more than the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest that was paid to them at emergence 
although the company does not agree with the position taken by the premier noteholders  in order to have the plan confirmed so that premier could complete reconstruction of its property and open its business without further delay  the company agreed to fund an escrow account to cover the premier noteholders claim for additional damages in the amount of  and a second escrow account for the trustee s reasonable legal fees and expenses in the amount of  entitlement to the escrows is expected to be determined by the court during the company believes it is probable that the court will approve payment of legal fees and expenses and has fully reserved for that contingency 
however  the company does not believe it is probable or remote that the court will find in favor of the premier noteholders with respect to the additional damages escrow  and any potential loss can not be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not accrued a loss for the additional damages contingency

capital leases of another subsidiary aggregating  consist of a sale leaseback transaction related to other corporate aircraft 
the parent company has guaranteed these financings 
the company s senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more indebtedness or issue preferred stock of subsidiaries if the company fails to maintain a specified ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth  limit the ability of the company and material subsidiaries to incur  in certain circumstances  funded debt or liens  and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures 
the company s bank credit agreement also contains covenants and restrictions which are generally more restrictive than the senior note indentures  however  the company has the ability to terminate the bank credit agreement if no amounts are outstanding 
the company is in compliance with all of these restrictions  and the company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company require that collateral be provided to the lender  principally as a result of such requirements  the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the company were approximately  at december  for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments  if any  is uncertain 
such amounts aggregated  at december   for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in these plans have been frozen  future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
although the company did not make any significant pension plan contributions during  the company does expect to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans 
the tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain  however  the company believes it will make substantial contributions over the next few years to reduce  but not to entirely eliminate  its defined benefit pension plan liability 
the company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to  and wiltel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of wiltel 
as of december   certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below dollars in thousands caption the company s wiltel s plans plans 
del projected benefit obligation   funded status balance sheet liability at december    deferred losses included in other comprehensive income   discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation del 
calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the company s plans  a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis  using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants 
for the wiltel plans  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market  adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements 
these discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by  and the benefit obligation by  the deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates  changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  for all plans 
a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during  based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was  which expires at various times through subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
substantially all of these letters of credit expire before as discussed above  the company has also guaranteed of the amounts outstanding under clc s  senior secured credit facility and clc s euro  senior secured bridge credit facility

critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period or  if such determination were made in connection with an acquisition  an adjustment would be made in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based  in significant part  upon the company s projection of future taxable income at any point in time 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
during and  the company s revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   in and  in of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense 
the company s conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income and its projections of future taxable income  and also takes into consideration unrealized gains in its investment portfolio 
the company s estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its current operations and investments  includes an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment  estimates apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and includes all future years that the company estimated it would have available net operating losses 
the company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain  and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts  further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible 
conversely  if the company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future  or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced  additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded 
at december   the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company did not recognize any impairment losses on long lived assets during or  however  during an impairment loss of  was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of wiltel s former headquarters facility to its estimated fair value in connection with the sale of wiltel to level classified with gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
wiltel s former headquarters building  including the adjacent parking garage  was not included in the sale to level and was retained by the company 
the company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used  from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment  was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable 
during  the building was sold for net cash proceeds of  which resulted in a small gain 
impairment of securities investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value 
the write downs are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ materially from the company s estimates and judgments 
the company recorded impairment charges for securities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss  however  under gaap the methods  assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long lived assets 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
purchase price allocations for all of the company s recent acquisitions have been finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material 
use of fair value estimates substantially all of the company s investment portfolio is classified as either available for sale or as trading securities  both of which are carried at estimated fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices  which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events  and as such are subject to market related risks and uncertainties 
the company also invests in limited partnerships or limited liability companies which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investees hold investments in publicly and non publicly traded securities  and as such are also subject to market related risks and uncertainties and the risks inherent in estimating the fair values of such securities 
since changes in the fair value of all of these investments are recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet  and with respect to trading securities or securities owned by equity method investees also in the company s consolidated statement of operations  the company is exposed to volatility in securities markets 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations general substantially all of the company s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the us and to a lesser extent internationally 
poor general economic conditions can reduce the demand for products or services sold by the company s operating subsidiaries and or result in reduced pricing for products or services 
troubled industry sectors  like the residential real estate market  can have an adverse direct impact not only on the company s real estate and property management and services segments  but also can have an adverse indirect impact on some of the company s other operating segments  including manufacturing and gaming entertainment 
the discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have on each segment  however  should general economic conditions worsen and or if the country experiences a recession  the company believes that all of its businesses would be more adversely impacted than currently anticipated 
the company does not have any operating businesses that are participants in the sub prime real estate lending sector  though a tightening in consumer lending standards has and will have a direct or indirect negative impact on certain of the company s operations 
the company s investment portfolio includes mortgage backed securities of  at december   however  all of these securities are rated investment grade and issued by united states government agencies or us government sponsored enterprises 
the company has also invested in certain investment partnerships classified as investments in associated companies that invest in securities whose values are directly affected by the sub prime lending crisis 
the company s exposure to changes in their values is limited to the net book value of its investment in such partnerships 
at december   the aggregate book value of the company s investments in such partnerships was approximately  manufacturing idaho timber revenues and other income for idaho timber for the years ended december  and and from the date of acquisition may through december  were   and  respectively  gross profits were   and  respectively  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were   and  respectively  depreciation and amortization expenses were   and  respectively  and pre tax income was   and  respectively 
idaho timber s revenues for continued to reflect the weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high grade lumber in the marketplace 
although shipment volume increased throughout much of as compared to the last quarter of  the full year shipment volume in declined by as compared to in addition  average selling prices for declined almost as compared to idaho timber expects that the abundance of existing homes available for sale in the market will continue to negatively impact housing starts and idaho timber s revenues during until housing starts begin to increase  dimension lumber shipping volume may remain flat or could decline further 
curtailment of production at primary sawmills due to their operating losses could reduce excess supply to some degree  however  spread as discussed below may not improve since demand and pricing for low grade lumber may increase if supplies are reduced 
idaho timber s revenues weakened during  reflecting lower average selling prices and reduced shipment volume 
this decline was principally due to weakening demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of lumber in the marketplace 
in october  the trade dispute between the us and canada over canadian lumber imports was resolved and a new softwood lumber agreement became effective that restricts and imposes a tax on canadian lumber imports 
prior to the effective date of that agreement  imports from canada increased  which added to the oversupply in the market 
raw material costs  the largest component of cost of sales approximately of cost of sales  declined during as compared to principally due to the same market conditions that have negatively impacted revenues 
however  raw material costs gradually increased throughout  reflecting less availability of low grade lumber due to increased shipments to asia and europe and lower canadian lumber imports 
the difference between idaho timber s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet spread is closely monitored  and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same 
spreads declined throughout  and were lower by approximately for the full year as compared to idaho timber intends to continue to focus on developing new higher margin products  diversifying its supply chain  improving cost control and solidifying customer and supplier relationships  in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre tax results 
manufacturing conwed plastics pre tax income for conwed plastics was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
its manufacturing revenues and other income were   and  and gross profits were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues were largely unchanged in as compared to and increased by in as compared to the slowdown in housing starts and a slow start in road construction due to weather conditions were principally responsible for the revenue decline in most of conwed plastics markets during markets that are impacted by the slowdown in the housing industry  which began in the second half of  include the carpet cushion  building and construction  erosion control and turf reinforcement markets 
in addition  increased competition in the erosion control market caused a decline in revenues during revenues also declined due to the removal of netting as a component of a customer s bedding product 
conwed plastics did realize increased revenues of  from its packaging market  principally due to acquisitions in may  and in february  july and october of conwed plastics expects revenues to continue to be adversely impacted in those markets related to housing  which may offset continued growth in the packaging market 
the increase in revenues in as compared to reflects  of increased revenues from the acquisitions of nsw in february and polynet in may  which increased the segment s product offerings and customer base 
in addition  revenues reflect increases in the erosion control  carpet cushion and turf reinforcement markets  partially reduced by a decline in the consumer products market due to lower demand for certain products 
these changes resulted from a variety of factors including the impact of price increases implemented in  increased road construction and using a new distributor for certain products 
while the carpet cushion market continued to benefit from the previously strong housing market through the first half of  it experienced a reduction in sales volume during the second half of the year resulting from a slowdown in housing starts 
raw material costs increased by approximately in as compared to and by approximately in as compared to the primary raw material in conwed plastics products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil 
in addition to managing resin purchases  conwed plastics has improved its ability to reduce and or reuse scrap and continues to seek further improvements in order to increase raw material utilization 
gross margins declined in as compared to  primarily due to product mix  increased raw material costs and greater depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisitions and equipment upgrades 
gross margins increased in as compared to despite the increase in raw material costs  as the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets  and increase sales and production volumes 
gross margin and pre tax results for and reflect  and  respectively  of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and depreciation expense 
pre tax results for reflects  of lower salaries and incentive compensation expense as compared to principally due to lower pre tax profits and the conversion of certain european management employees from salaried employees to contract based professionals 
pre tax results for reflect  of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense than  principally due to greater pre tax profits and increased headcount 
telecommunications the telecommunications business of sti prepaid has been consolidated by the company since march for the period from the asset acquisition through december   sti prepaid s telecommunications revenues and other income were  telecommunications cost of sales were  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were  selling  general and other expenses were  and sti prepaid had pre tax income of  historically  sti prepaid s revenue volumes have not declined during periods of generally poor economic conditions  as customers have found prepaid calling cards to be an attractive alternative to other  higher priced long distance services 
however  sti prepaid s revenues have declined  as business was lost to existing competitors and new entrants into the market  which have been offering low entry pricing to gain market share which sti prepaid believes is not sustainable 
in addition  during the period sti prepaid was transitioning from being a private company to a subsidiary of the company  it lost some distributors  which negatively impacted revenues 
sti prepaid has refocused its efforts at maintaining strong and frequent contact with its distributors  which was lacking at times during  in an effort to rebuild those relationships and grow revenue 
property management and services the property management and services operations of resortquest have been consolidated by the company since june for the period from its acquisition through december   property management and services revenues and other income were  direct operating expenses were  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were  depreciation and amortization expenses were  selling  general and other expenses were  and pre tax losses were  although revenue trends since acquisition have been consistent with pre acquisition periods  the vacation rental component of the property management business could be negatively impacted by poor economic conditions in the us  including the impact of higher fuel prices and less disposable income 
slowdowns might be more acutely felt in the fly to markets like ski areas  rather than drive to markets like northwest florida 
even if overall reservations do not decrease  the number of advance bookings could decline as consumers wait to decide closer to travel dates whether and where they will vacation 
resortquest has initiated a number of promotions to entice repeat customers into booking their reservations well in advance of arrival 
the real estate brokerage business has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed real estate market 
gaming entertainment as more fully discussed above  premier was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when acquired during  however  while in bankruptcy proceedings from september  to emergence on august   premier was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
premier s casino and hotel operations opened to the public on june   prior to opening  premier s activities principally consisted of rebuilding and repairing the hotel and casino facilities that were severely damaged by hurricane katrina and its bankruptcy proceedings 
for the period from emergence from bankruptcy date of reconsolidation through december   premier s revenues and other income were  and its pre tax losses were  premier s results for this period include direct operating expenses of  interest expense of  salaries and incentive compensation expenses of  depreciation and amortization expenses of  and selling  general and other expenses of  for the period from date of acquisition april through its filing for bankruptcy in september  premier s pre tax losses were not material 
the hard rock biloxi was the last gaming operation to open in biloxi following hurricane katrina 
the hard rock biloxi is still in the early stages of establishing its customer database and instituting customer loyalty programs and has not yet achieved a market share of the local gaming market commensurate with the size of its facility and the gaming choices it offers 
although premier expected it would take some time to build its business  its revenue growth since it opened has been slower than expected 
its competitors in the mississippi gulf coast gaming market have been in operation longer than premier and have more established gaming operations  marketing programs and customer databases 
the company s share of premier s net loss under the equity method of accounting from january  to the date of emergence from bankruptcy was  and not material during domestic real estate pre tax income loss for the domestic real estate segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pre tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment s operating properties  the current status of the company s real estate development projects and non recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold 
as a result  pre tax results for this segment for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern 
the company did not have any major real estate sales during  resulting in significantly lower pre tax profits than in during  real estate revenues and other income include  of charges related to the accounting for the mark to market value of an interest rate derivative relating to the myrtle beach project s debt obligation 
pre tax results for include  of incentive compensation accruals related to the company s real estate development project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
during pre tax income includes the sale by square  which resulted in a pre tax gain of  and the sale of other land parcels in utah for a pre tax gain of  in addition  the company recognized pre tax profit related to its lot development project in south walton county  florida of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such amounts principally result from the completion of certain required improvements to land previously sold 
pre tax results for reflect  of incentive compensation accruals related to the company s real estate development project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
medical product development pre tax losses net of minority interest for sangart for the years ended december  and and from the date of acquisition november through december  were   and  respectively 
sangart s losses for these periods reflect research and development costs of   and  respectively  and salaries and incentive compensation expenses of   and  respectively 
as more fully discussed above  sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales 
since inception  it has been developing its current product candidate  hemospan r  and is currently conducting two phase iii clinical trials in europe 
it does not expect to complete those clinical trials until  and if they are successful it will then seek approval with the appropriate regulatory authorities to market its product 
sangart also recently completed a smaller phase ii clinical trial in the us  data from which is still being compiled 
until such time  if ever  that sangart obtains regulatory approval for hemospan  the company will report losses from this segment 
us or foreign regulatory agencies could also require sangart to perform more clinical trials  which could be both expensive and time consuming 
the company expects to invest up to an additional  in upon its exercise of existing warrants which will continue to fund sangart s research and development costs and which will be expensed by the company over time 
the company is unable to predict with certainty when  if ever  it will report operating profits for this segment 
when the company increases its investment in sangart  the additional investment is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the price paid is allocated to sangart s individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values  in sangart s case  a portion of the fair value of assets acquired was initially allocated to research and development 
however  since under current gaap the company is not permitted to recognize research and development as an asset under the purchase method  any amounts initially allocated to research and development are immediately expensed 
the company expensed acquired research and development of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which is included in the caption selling  general and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in salaries and incentive compensation in as compared to was due to increased headcount in connection with the commencement of the phase iii trials  including the need to increase hemospan production for the clinical trials 
corporate and other operations investment and other income decreased in as compared to the same periods in investment and other income during includes  related to the sales of two associated companies  investment and other income during includes the receipt of escrowed proceeds from one of those sales of  that had not been previously recognized 
in addition  investment and other income for includes  from the recovery of bankruptcy claims 
interest income also declined by  in as compared to principally due to the sale of interest bearing securities to generate cash to purchase fortescue s securities and interests in associated companies 
for  investment and other income includes  related to the termination of a joint development agreement with another party 
the amount recorded in other income substantially reimbursed the company for its prior expenditures  which were fully expensed as incurred 
investment and other income for also includes  of foreign exchange gains 
investment and other income includes income charges of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the accounting for mark to market values of corporate derivatives 
investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to greater interest income of  reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates   related to the sales of two associated companies and  from the recovery of bankruptcy claims 
investment and other income in includes a gain of  on the sale of of the company s interest in clc to inmet 
net securities gains for corporate and other operations aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and the company s net securities gains largely reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as corporate available for sale securities and unrealized gains on trading securities 
included in net securities gains for is a gain of  from the sale of eastman 
included in net securities gains for is a gain of  from the sale of level common stock 
included in net securities gains for is a gain of  from the sale of  shares of wmig common stock 
net securities gains for  and include provisions of   and  respectively  to write down the company s investments in certain available for sale securities and  in  an investment in a non public security 
the company s decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security s value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future 
the decision could also be influenced by the status of the company s tax attributes or liquidity needs  however  sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations 
therefore  the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects interest expense relating to the senior notes issued in march  the senior notes issued in september and the fixed rate repurchase agreements
