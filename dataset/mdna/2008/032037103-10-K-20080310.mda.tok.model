item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation the corporation  which operates in two business segments more fully described below  achieved record results in the forged and cast rolls group was the principal contributor with the air and liquid processing segment producing a much improved level of earnings 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel and davy roll company limited davy roll 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas davy roll produces cast iron and steel rolls and has facilities in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment consists of aerofin corporation aerofin  buffalo air handling company buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  inc buffalo pumps 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling produces custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
aerofin and buffalo air handling have operations in virginia and buffalo pumps is located in new york 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
results for the forged and cast rolls group for were the highest on record 
the increased level of steel and aluminum production throughout the world  particularly in developing countries  the global shortage of roll making capacity and the weak dollar contributed to the continuing demand for rolls produced by this segment 
the outlook for the foreseeable future is favorable 
customers concerned with the ongoing availability of rolls have entered into long term supply arrangements going out several years 
these arrangements generally include protection against inflation in the cost of materials and cancellation of orders 
with backlog unfilled orders on hand at record levels  the segment has filled its capacity for and several years beyond for certain roll types 
the forged and cast rolls segment is undertaking a major capital program investing approximately million  in addition to its normal level of capital expenditure  over the next three years 
while not significantly adding to the production capacity of the group  the expenditures will minimize equipment down time  improve productivity and maintain the manufacture of premium  quality product 
during the year  a subsidiary of union electric steel entered into an agreement with maanshan iron steel company limited maanshan to form a joint venture company in china 
the joint venture will principally manufacture and sell forged backup rolling mill rolls of a size and weight currently not able to be produced by union electric steel 
it is anticipated to have an initial annual capacity of approximately  metric tons with union electric steel having exclusive marketing and sales rights 
production is expected to begin by early union electric steel has a forty nine percent interest in the joint venture which is accounted for on the equity method see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the focus for the forged and cast rolls segment in the coming year will be to manage the ever extending backlog while operating at capacity  maintaining the reliability of equipment  and coordinating the new backup roll joint venture in china while sustaining its reputation for superior quality and on time delivery 
results for the air and liquid processing segment for were the highest since with each company s operating performance stronger than in and in particular  the volume sensitive air handling systems business returned to profitability from close to break even results in and losses in in  results for the group were severely impacted by a  pre tax charge for estimated settlement and defense costs of pending and future asbestos claims offset by estimated insurance recoveries see note to consolidated financial statements 
the outlook for for this segment is for a modest increase in sales and operating income 
ampco pittsburgh annual report consolidated results of operations overview consolidated sales and operating income for  and are indicated below 
a full discussion of the operating results for each of the segments is presented later in this section 
the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs total backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total in comparison to the prior years  sales and operating income for improved significantly for each of the segments on higher volumes and  for the forged and cast rolls group  better pricing 
income from operations for was negatively impacted by higher net periodic pension costs associated with the corporation s various pension plans 
pension costs increased by approximately  and when compared to and  respectively  due principally to changes in assumptions 
the growth in backlog at december  against december  and is attributable to the forged and cast rolls segment and increased demand for rolling mill rolls 
a shortage of roll manufacturing capacity has forced customers to place orders considerably in advance of shipment dates  accordingly  approximately  or of the backlog is scheduled for delivery beyond in addition  the forged and cast rolls group has commitments from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of purchases orders 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales approximated  and for  and  respectively 
the improvement is primarily attributable to the additional volume and better pricing  particularly for the forged and cast rolls segment 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  was negatively affected in by higher net periodic pension costs associated with the corporation s various pension plans 
by comparison  was adversely impacted by unprecedented increases in the cost of steel scrap and ferro alloys used by the forged and cast rolls group and its inability to recover such costs due to fixed selling price contracts 
increase in commodity costs have continued  however  starting in  a variable index surcharge mechanism was adopted which provides protection from unforeseen increases in cost of raw materials 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the dollar increase is due principally to higher sales commissions which are at fixed percentage and accordingly increase as sales rise  general inflationary increases associated with salaries and fringes and higher net periodic pension costs 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  for a period of seven years ending december  the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment see note to consolidated financial statements 
ampco pittsburgh annual report investment related income improved in versus and in against due to higher investment balances throughout the respective years  better rates of return and increased dividends from the corporation s uk chinese cast roll joint venture company 
such dividends approximated in and in  the first year that dividends were received 
interest expense for and was comparable and the increase from is attributable to higher interest rates on the corporation s variable rate industrial revenue bonds 
other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of higher foreign exchange losses in versus gains in and an additional provision of for environmental costs estimated to be incurred relating to the remediation of real estate previously owned by a discontinued operation was provided in and is included in other income expense for that year 
the corporation s statutory income tax rate ranges between which compares to an effective rate of  and for  and  respectively 
the effective rates were reduced by the reversal of valuation allowances previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with capital loss carryforwards for  and primarily with the uk operation for and which resulted in an overall income tax benefit for each of those two years 
beneficial permanent differences for the domestic operations also favorably impacted the effective rates 
as a result of the above  the corporation earned  or per common share for   or per common share for and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax benefit of or per common share for the release of tax related valuation allowances associated with capital loss carryforwards 
net income for includes a net after tax charge of  or per common share for the estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through offset by the release of tax related valuation allowances principally for the corporation s uk operation 
net income for includes a net after tax benefit of  or per common share for proceeds from settlement of a business interruption insurance claim and the release of tax related valuation allowances principally for the corporation s uk operation 
forged and cast rolls sales operating income backlog the forged and cast rolls segment continued to benefit from growth in steel production throughout the world  particularly in developing countries 
this  together with a global shortage of roll making capacity  resulted in improved pricing  higher volumes and a more favorable product mix for the segment culminating in record sales and operating income for more than seventy percent of the sales for this group were to countries outside of the us and us the variable index surcharge program implemented in helps to protect the corporation against fluctuations in the cost of steel scrap and alloys used in the manufacture of rolls 
by comparison  part of was negatively impacted by fixed selling price contracts and the inability to pass on these higher costs to the customer 
proceeds of  from a business interruption insurance claim relating to flood damage caused in were received in and are included in earnings 
order backlogs have continued to improve and are indicative of the increase in global demand along with customers ordering their roll requirements several years in advance to ensure continuity of supply 
approximately  or of the december  backlog is scheduled for shipment beyond in addition  the forged and cast rolls group has commitments of more than  from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of specific purchase orders closer to the requirement dates for delivery 
ampco pittsburgh annual report air and liquid processing operating income loss for includes a  charge for asbestos litigation relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
sales operating income loss backlog in  the air and liquid processing segment had its best performance over the past five years 
sales and operating income increased for each of the operations primarily as a result of higher volumes of business activity 
for buffalo pumps  sales and operating income bettered due to additional orders for commercial pumps from the power generation industry and pumps for us navy shipbuilders 
for aerofin  greater market share and continued demand from oem customers improved sales and operating income 
with respect to buffalo air handling  sales and operating income increased in as a result of a strong opening backlog with operating income being further enhanced by manufacturing efficiencies attributable to a more experienced labor force 
order backlogs for buffalo pumps and aerofin improved in comparison to the prior years 
the pumps operation benefited from additional orders by power generation customers and navy shipbuilders and the heat exchange coil business experienced increased demand from its oem customers 
backlog at the beginning of the year for buffalo air handling was strong  however  some slowdown was experienced during the year as the economy weakened causing backlog to fall below that as of the end of and approximately  or of the december  backlog for this segment is scheduled for shipment beyond liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for and were comparable at  and  respectively  against  for the improvement from is primarily attributable to the positive cash flow effect from increased earnings 
while the  charge for asbestos litigation recorded in reduced earnings  it did not impact cash flows for that year 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years 
net payments in approximated and are estimated at  in the overall improvement in the corporation s business activity resulted in higher sales in the fourth quarter of increasing accounts receivable as of december  in comparison to and similarly  inventories were higher due to additional demand for product  particularly rolling mill rolls 
in  the corporation received  of proceeds from its business interruption insurance claim for damage caused by flooding to its principal roll finishing facility in net cash flows used in provided by investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
the fluctuation is primarily attributable to a change in the corporation s investment strategy in resulting in liquidation of shortterm investments at year end and with monies re invested in january of the following year 
by comparison  the corporation was a net purchaser of short term marketable securities in of  cash outflows include capital expenditures of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   future capital expenditures approximating  have been approved by the board of directors of the corporation  which include approximately  for the purchase of a forge press  manipulator  and ancillary equipment for the corporation s domestic forged roll facility to be spent over the next months 
additionally  union electric steel made its initial contribution of  for its interest in the newly created joint venture with the remaining  expected to be contributed over the next two years 
davy roll also contributed to its chinese cast roll joint venture in net cash outflows from financing activities were substantially breakeven for with proceeds from the issuance of stock under the corporation s stock option plan and resulting excess tax benefits offsetting dividends paid 
by comparison  dividends paid in and exceeded proceeds received from the issuance of stock under the corporation s stock option plan 
quarterly dividends for were per common share and per common share in and ampco pittsburgh annual report the change in the value of the euro and the british pound against the dollar impacted cash and cash equivalents by  and for  and  respectively 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents increased by  in and ended the year at  in comparison to  at december  at december   the corporation had cash and cash equivalents of  and investments in short term marketable securities of approximately  funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance the operational and capital expenditure requirements of the corporation 
the corporation also maintains short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of its businesses 
the total available at december  was approximately  including  in the uk and in belgium 
the corporation has the following contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period total years other industrial revenue bond debt operating lease obligations capital expenditures pension and other postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits contributions to joint venture total amount represents principal only 
interest is not included since it is variable  interest rates ranged between and in the current year 
the industrial revenue bonds begin to mature in  however  if the bonds are unable to be remarketed they will be refinanced under a separate facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contributions to the us non qualified defined benefit plan  the other postretirement benefit plan and the curtailed davy roll defined benefit pension plan 
no contributions were required in to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and amounts to be contributed in the future  if any  are currently not known 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents primarily commitments for the purchase of natural gas through covering approximately of anticipated needs to meet orders in backlog 
represents uncertain tax positions subject to an ongoing or contemplated examination by the respective tax authority 
amounts for uncertain tax positions not currently subject to or expected to be subject to audit are included as other since the period of cash settlement can not be reasonably estimated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  the corporation is currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned and has been named a potentially responsible party at three third party landfill sites 
in addition  as a result of a sale of a segment  the corporation retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination at two of the sold locations and has agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination from one of these locations 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  in the opinion of management  the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately  accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature and scope of the corporation s business brings it into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  the corporation and its subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  the corporation does not anticipate that its financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
ampco pittsburgh annual report effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment against the volatility in the cost of raw materials 
additionally  long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations and commitments have been executed for natural gas usage to cover a significant portion of orders in the backlog 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  litigation  environmental matters and income taxes 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from the corporation s actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
specifically  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid out over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
consideration is also given to historical rates of return and the mix of investments 
for the domestic plan  the rates of return earned on the market related value of plan assets averaged for the ten year period of accordingly  the corporation believes the expected long term rate of return of for its domestic plan for and to be reasonable 
the foreign plan was formed in connection with the acquisition of the uk operations with plan assets transferred from the seller s plan to a newly created plan in october the rates of return earned on the market related value of the plan assets averaged for accordingly  the corporation believes the assumed long term rate of return of for and for to be reasonable 
the discount rates utilized in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
the corporation believes the assumed rates of and as of december  for its domestic and u 
k plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
the corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in connection with the corporation s strategic planning process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information and represents the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions  pricing and volume 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for goodwill of  is recoverable and is not impaired as of december  litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of certain of the corporation s operating subsidiaries asbestos liability and of an inactive subsidiary and another former division of the corporation 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of its relevant insurance polices  prior to the fourth quarter of  the corporation had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending claims for asbestos liability nor for settlement or defense costs for claims that may be asserted against certain subsidiaries and the corporation in the future 
for prior periods  the corporation did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of pending or future claims 
to assist the corporation in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability  along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amount of any estimates  the corporation hired nationally recognized asbestos liability experts and insurance consultants 
the experts were not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary or the former division  which the corporation believes are immaterial 
based on their analyses  in  the corporation established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through  and also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
these amounts relied on assumptions that are based on currently known facts and strategy 
in  the corporation undertook another review of its asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries and determined no change to the provision should be made at this time 
the corporation s actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect the corporation s asbestos liability and ability to recover under its insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
the corporation intends to evaluate its estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a periodic basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these periodic reviews may result in the corporation incurring future charges  however  the corporation is currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to the corporation s estimate of its recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to the corporation s liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  its tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of the corporation s operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if the corporation determined it would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation ampco pittsburgh annual report allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if the corporation determined it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  it would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   the corporation has deferred income tax assets approximating  net of a valuation allowance of  the corporation does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  the corporation would derecognize the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if the corporation subsequently determined that a tax position met the more likely than not criteria  it would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  the corporation believes the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation views its primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  the corporation s policy is to hedge a portion of its foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of the corporation s foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for the corporation s domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of its raw materials and energy  the corporation enters into contracts for a particular commodity copper and purchases a portion of its energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  steel scrap and ferro alloys would have an impact of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the ability to pass these increases on to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with the corporation potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect the corporation against such commodity price increases
