item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
a failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical care costs may negatively impact our results of operations 
because of the significant time lag between when medical services are actually rendered by our providers and when we receive  process  and pay a claim for those medical services  we must continually estimate our medical claims liability at particular points in time  and establish claims reserves related to such estimates 
our estimated reserves for such incurred but not reported  or ibnr medical care costs  are based on numerous assumptions 
we estimate our medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract 
table of contents changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer hmos in missouri  ohio  and texas is impacted by the limited claims payment history of those hmos 
likewise  our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer lines of business or populations  such as with respect to medicare advantage or aged  blind  or disabled medicaid members  is likewise impacted by the more limited experience we have had with those populations 
the ibnr estimation methods we use and the resulting reserves that we establish are reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if deemed necessary  are reflected in the current period 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  our actual claims liabilities for particular periods could differ significantly from the amounts estimated and reserved 
our actual claims liabilities have varied and will continue to vary from our estimates  particularly in times of significant changes in utilization  medical cost trends  and populations and markets served 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period could be negatively affected 
our estimates of ibnr may be inadequate in the future  which would negatively affect our results of operations for the relevant time period 
furthermore  if we are unable to accurately estimate ibnr  our ability to take timely corrective actions may be limited  further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results 
for additional information regarding this risk  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
there are numerous risks associated with the growth of our ohio hmo 
membership at our ohio hmo has grown rapidly  and the medical care ratio of our ohio plan has been substantially higher than that historically experienced by the company as a whole 
in  the medical care ratio of our ohio plan was 
for  we have projected that we can lower the medical care ratio of our ohio plan to approximately 
in the event we are unable to do so  our higher than expected medical care ratio in ohio could negatively impact the financial performance of the company as a whole 
in addition  the lower amount of experience of our ohio medicaid and abd members in accessing managed care  of our local providers in coordinating managed care services for their patients  and our relative lack of experience in operating in that state  may also contribute to a higher than average medical care ratio 
in addition  as our ohio plan continues to grow  we will be required to increase the amount of regulatory capital we contribute to it 
in december  we were required to contribute million in additional regulatory capital to our ohio plan 
if we are required to contribute additional capital in the future  our existing cash balances or cash from operations may not be sufficient to cover such payments  in which case we would be required to draw down on our credit facility or obtain additional financing from another source and thereby incur additional indebtedness 
in the event we are unable to lower our medical care ratio in ohio  or if the ohio plan requires a disproportionate investment of corporate energy and resources or is otherwise unsuccessful  the poor performance of that health plan could detrimentally impact the financial performance of the company as a whole 
if our government contracts are not renewed or are terminated  or if the rfp bids of our health plans are not successful  our premium revenues could be materially reduced 
our contracts generally run for periods of from one year to four years  and may be successively extended by amendment for additional periods if the relevant state agency so elects 
our current contracts expire on various dates over the next several years 
there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended 
for example  in the fall of  we were informed that the contract of our indiana hmo to provide medicaid services would not be extended beyond its expiration date of december  moreover  our contracts may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers 
as an example of that  our new mexico health plan recently submitted a bid in response to the request for proposals of the new mexico medicaid authority for the new salud medicaid managed care contract 
in addition  all of our contracts may be terminated for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
our contracts with the states are also subject to cancellation by the state in the event of unavailability of state or federal funding 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
in addition  most contracts are terminable without cause 
we may face increased competition as other plans many with greater financial resources and greater name recognition attempt to enter our markets through the contracting process 
if we are unable to renew  successfully re bid  or compete for any of our government contracts  or if any of our contracts are terminated or renewed on less favorable terms  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states 
operations in california  michigan  new mexico  ohio  utah  and washington accounted for most of our premium revenues in if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or in any other states in which we have a health plan  or if our current operations in any portion of the states we are in were significantly curtailed  our revenues could decrease materially 
our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on a loss of a material contract  legislative actions  changes in medicaid eligibility methodologies  catastrophic claims  an epidemic or unexpected increase in utilization  general economic conditions  and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we currently operate could adversely affect our results of operations 
a sustained drop in the rate of interest earned on our invested balances could adversely affect our revenues 
our revenues from invested balances were million in we have projected that  on average in fiscal year  our invested balances will earn interest at the rate of at least 
however  due to the slowing growth in the economy at the beginning of  the federal reserve bank board has effected a series of cuts to the target federal funds interest rate 
these rate cuts lower the interest rate we can achieve on our invested balances 
for every one quarter drop in interest rates  our investment income will be reduced by approximately million 
in the event the interest earned on our invested balances throughout averages less than per annum  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to achieve our projected growth in medicare members or our projected medical care ratio with respect to our medicare program  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business strategy includes increasing enrollment for our members who are dually eligible under both the medicaid and medicare programs  as well as increasing the number of our members eligible under medicare alone 
our experience with the medicare program and with medicare members is much more limited than our experience with medicaid 
the administrative processes  programmatic requirements  and regulations pertaining to the medicare program differ significantly from those of the medicaid program 
likewise  the medicare population has many characteristics and behavior patterns which differ from the medicaid population with which we are familiar 
finally  medicare providers  provider networks  and provider relations also differ from those of medicaid 
during  we will continue to invest heavily in the infrastructure necessary to grow our medicare program 
we have projected that we will add  medicare members in  and that our medical care ratio with respect to our medicare members will be approximately 
in the event we are unable to enroll as many medicare members as we project or are unable to maintain a medical care ratio of no greater than  or if we are unable to quickly develop our medicare expertise and adapt to the differing requirements and needs of the medicare program and medicare members  our business strategy may be unsuccessful and our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
medicaid and schip funding is subject to political disagreements over budgetary funding and efforts to control governmental spending in order to balance federal and or state budgets 
nearly all of our revenues come from federal and state funding of the medicaid and schip programs 
because these governmental health care programs account for such a large portion of federal and state budgets  efforts to contain overall governmental spending and to achieve a balanced budget often result in significant political pressure being directed at the funding for these programs 
the funding of our various medicaid contracts  or the rate increases we expect to obtain during the course of a year  can thus be put at risk whenever there is a federal or state budget impasse  a budgetary crisis  or political disagreement that is not quickly resolved 
for example in the summer of  passage of the budget for the state of california was months overdue  thereby threatening the funding of our california health plan s contracts with the state 
in early  due to a mounting state budget deficit  the california legislature passed and governor arnold schwarzenegger signed a across the board cut to most california government funded programs  including the reimbursement rates paid to physicians under medi cal as well as medi cal outpatient fees 
the cuts are 
table of contents scheduled to be implemented on july  unless an alternative budget is passed and signed before that date 
the michigan state government briefly shut down on october  due to lack of agreement on a significant budget shortfall in that state 
funding under the federal schip program  which provided of our total premium revenues for the year ended december   is subject to an ongoing political disagreement between the united states congress and president bush 
while it is unclear when a political compromise might be reached  the schip program has been extended on its existing terms through march  overall medicaid enrollment and costs are projected to continue to increase over the next several years 
these increasing costs  combined with an economic slowdown or recession in  will exert additional budgetary pressures on federal and state governments 
in the event of a recession  an extended budgetary or political impasse at either the federal or state level  the failure of the california legislature to pass an alternative budget with less draconian cuts to medi cal provider rates  the failure of the states of michigan  missouri  or texas to provide our health plans in those states with their expected rate increases  or the non renewal of the schip program  the funding of one or more of our contracts could be curtailed or cut off which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
funding under our contracts is also subject to regulatory and programmatic adjustments and reforms for which we may not be appropriately compensated 
the federal government and the governments of the states in which we operate frequently consider legislative and regulatory proposals regarding medicaid reform and programmatic changes 
such proposals involve  among other things  changes in reimbursement or payment levels based on certain parameters or member characteristics  changes in eligibility for medicaid  and changes in benefits covered such as pharmacy  behavioral health  or vision 
any of these changes could be made effective retroactively 
if our cost increases resulting from these changes are not matched by commensurate increases in our revenue  we would be unable to make offsetting adjustments  such as supplemental premiums or changes in our benefit plans  as would a commercial health plan 
for example  as part of its periodic rebasing of diagnostic related group drg rates to adjust for changes in hospital cost experience  effective august   the state of washington recalibrated the relative weights used in its drg reimbursement system for in patient hospital claims 
the changes were intended to be budget neutral  but corresponding increases were not made to the amounts paid to managed care organizations such as our washington health plan until january  as a result  the washington drg rebasing increased our washington plan s medical care costs for the second half of without a compensating increase in payments to the washington plan 
any other such regulatory or programmatic reforms at either the federal or state level could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
the acquisitions of medicaid contract rights and other health plans have accounted for a significant amount of our growth over the last several years 
for example  on november   we acquired mercy careplus  an hmo in missouri 
although we cannot predict with certainty our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions  we believe that additional acquisitions of all sizes will be important to our future growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets particular operators of commercial health plans have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
also  many of the sellers may insist on selling assets that we do not want  such as commercial lines of business  or may insist on transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets 
even if we identify suitable targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
further  to the extent we complete an acquisition  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition because of operational factors or difficulty in integrating the acquisition with our existing business 
this may include problems involving the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations or our corporate culture  new provider networks which may operate on terms different from our existing networks  
table of contents additional members who may decide to transfer to other health care providers or health plans  disparate information  claims processing  and record keeping systems  internal controls and accounting policies  including those which require the exercise of judgment and complex estimation processes  such as estimates of claims incurred but not reported  accounting for goodwill  intangible assets  stock based compensation  and income tax matters  and new regulatory schemes  relationships  practices  and compliance requirements 
also  we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not already operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we would be required to obtain regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of that state in which we did not operate previously 
we may be unable to obtain the necessary governmental approvals or comply with these regulatory requirements in a timely manner  if at all 
for all of the above reasons  we may not be able to consummate our proposed acquisitions as announced from time to time to sustain our pattern of growth or to realize benefits from completed acquisitions 
ineffective management of our growth may negatively affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
depending on acquisitions and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow our membership and to expand into other markets 
in fiscal year  we had total premium revenue of  million 
in fiscal year  we had total premium revenue of  million  an increase of over a three year span 
continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other company resources 
our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to strengthen our management team and attract  train  and retain skilled employees  and our ability to implement and improve operational  financial  and management information systems on a timely basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability and liquidity 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than managed care organizations 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude in interpreting and applying them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with members and the public 
for instance  some states mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
the interpretation of certain contract provisions by our governmental regulators may also change 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations  could reduce our profitability by imposing additional capital requirements  increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing mandated benefits  forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
changes in the interpretation of our contracts could also reduce our profitability if we have detrimentally relied on a prior interpretation 
we are subject to various routine and non routine governmental reviews  audits  and investigations 
violation of the laws governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide managed care services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses  and exclusion from participation in government sponsored health programs  including medicaid and schip 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability  and might also lose one or more of our 
table of contents government contracts and as a result lose significant numbers of members and amounts of revenue 
in addition  government receivables are subject to government audit and negotiation  and government contracts are vulnerable to disagreements with the government 
the final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be different from the amounts we initially recognize in our financial statements 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are typically approved for multi year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
our business depends on our information and medical management systems  and our inability to effectively integrate  manage  and keep secure our information and medical management systems could disrupt our operations 
our business is dependent on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  supporting our medical management techniques  processing provider claims  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status  and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information and medical management systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the licensor or vendor of any software which is integral to our operations were to become insolvent or otherwise fail to support the software sufficiently  our operations could be negatively affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
our policy is to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement  maintain  upgrade or expand our system  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems  and increases in administrative expenses 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our members  providers  or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if they are not prevented 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals  and other providers with whom we contract  or if we are unable to enter into cost effective contracts with such providers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization  and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments  or take other actions which could result in higher health care costs  disruption to provider access for current members  a decline in our growth rate  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 

table of contents in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations  and some specialists  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts which are disadvantageous to us  our profitability in those areas could be adversely affected 
some providers that render services to our members are not contracted with our plans 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and our plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider 
in some states  the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms 
in such instances  providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with our plan 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
failure to attain profitability in any new start up operations or in connection with our expansion into medicare could negatively affect our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have infrastructure and required systems in place  and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims 
often we are also required to contribute significant capital in order to fund mandated net worth requirements  performance bonds or escrows  or contingency guaranties 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the certificate of authority  winning the bid to provide services  or attracting members in sufficient numbers to cover our costs  any new business of ours would fail 
we also could be required by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or to recover our significant start up costs 
even if we are successful in establishing a profitable hmo in a new state  increasing membership  revenues  and medical costs will trigger increased mandated net worth requirements which could substantially exceed the net income generated by the hmo 
rapid growth in an existing state will also create increased net worth requirements 
in such circumstances we may not be able to fund on a timely basis or at all the increased net worth requirements with our available cash resources 
the expenses associated with starting up a health plan in a new state or expanding a health plan in an existing state could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
likewise  our expansion into medicare involves substantial start up costs for which there may be minimal associated revenue 
for example  we must hire sales personnel and establish a rigorous and comprehensive compliance program 
the expenses associated with our expansion into medicare could have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
high profile qui tam matters and negative publicity regarding medicaid managed care and medicare advantage may lead to programmatic changes  intensified regulatory scrutiny  or guilt by association 
certain of our competitors have recently been involved in high profile qui tam or whistleblower actions which have resulted in significant volatility in the price of their stock 
because of the limited number of health care companies competing in our market space  these whistleblower actions and investigations  and the resulting negative publicity  could become associated with or imputed to the company  regardless of the company s actual regulatory compliance 
such an association  as well as any perception of a recurring pattern of abuse among the health plan participants in these government programs and the diminished reputation of the managed care sector as a whole  could result in public distrust  political pressure for programmatic changes  intensified scrutiny by regulators  increased stock volatility due to speculative trading  and heightened barriers to new managed care markets and contracts  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
we face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions  including medical malpractice actions  provider disputes  employment related disputes  and breach of contract actions 
in the event we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage  our profitability would suffer 
in addition  our providers involved in medical care decisions are exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
providers at the primary care clinics we operate in california are employees of our california health plan 
as a direct employer of physicians and ancillary medical personnel and as an operator of primary care clinics  our california plan is subject to liability for negligent acts  omissions  or injuries occurring at one of its clinics or caused by one of its employees 
we maintain medical malpractice insurance for our clinics in the amount of million per occurrence  and an annual aggregate limit of million  errors and omissions insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in aggregate for each policy year  and such other lines of coverage as we believe are reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  given the significant amount of some medical malpractice awards and settlements  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from damage awards or other liabilities 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
furthermore  claimants often sue managed care organizations for improper denials of or delays in care  and in some instances improper authorizations of care 
also  congress and several state legislatures have considered legislation that would permit managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
if this or similar legislation were enacted  claims of this nature could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable medical malpractice insurance coverage 
successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers  or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation  other such liabilities may not be covered by insurance  the insurers could dispute coverage  or the amount of insurance could be insufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
although we have established reserves for litigation as we believe appropriate  we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the litigation to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows and could prompt us to change our operating procedures 
the medicaid citizenship documentation requirements may adversely impact the enrollment levels of our health plans 
the united states department of health and human services requires persons applying for medicaid to document their citizenship 
the documentation requirement is outlined in section of the deficit reduction act of and is intended to ensure that medicaid beneficiaries are united states citizens without imposing undue burdens on them or the states 
the rule requires actual documentary evidence before medicaid eligibility is granted or renewed 
the provision requires that a person provide both evidence of citizenship and identity 
in many cases  a 
table of contents single document will be enough to establish both citizenship and identity  such as a passport 
however  if secondary documentation is used  such as a birth certificate  the individual will also need evidence of his or her identity 
affidavits can only be used in rare circumstances 
additional types of documentation  such as school records  may be used for children 
once citizenship has been proven  it need not be documented again with each eligibility renewal unless later evidence raises a question 
each state must implement its own process for assuring compliance with documentation of citizenship in order to obtain federal matching funds  and effective compliance is part of medicaid program integrity monitoring 
in particular  audit processes track the extent to which a state relies on lower categories of documentation  and on affidavits  with the expectation that such categories would be used relatively infrequently and less over time  as state processes and beneficiary documentation improves 
because this rule is relatively new and states have varied their compliance processes since its implementation  it is unclear what the full impact will be on the enrollment levels of our various state hmos 
the rule could result in the disenrollment of a material number of our members  thereby decreasing our premium revenues 
as a result  this proof of citizenship requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we are subject to competition which negatively impacts our ability to increase penetration in the markets we serve 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size  location  and quality of provider network  benefits supplied  quality of service  and reputation 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by the financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete  including large commercial plans  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
for these reasons  we may be unable to grow our membership  or may lose members to other health plans 
restrictions and covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to make certain acquisitions 
in order to provide liquidity  we have a million senior secured credit facility that matures in may as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
our credit facility imposes numerous restrictions and covenants  including prescribed debt coverage ratios  net worth requirements  and acquisition limitations that restrict our financial and operating flexibility  including our ability to make certain acquisitions above specified values and declare dividends without lender approval 
as a result of the restrictions and covenants imposed under our credit facility  our growth strategy may be negatively impacted by our inability to act with complete flexibility  or our inability to use our credit facility in the manner intended 
if we are in default at a time when funds under the credit facility are required to finance an acquisition  or if a proposed acquisition does not satisfy the pro forma financial requirements under our credit facility  we may be unable to use the credit facility in the manner intended 
in addition  if we were to draw down on our credit facility  or incur other additional debt in the future  it could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market 
table of contents conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings  and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility and obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time frame  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time frame acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
we are dependent on our executive officers and other key employees 
our operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our executive officers 
the loss of their leadership  knowledge  and experience could negatively impact our operations 
replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the managed care industry have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours 
our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  technical  and medical personnel 
we may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining such personnel which could negatively impact our operations 
a pandemic  such as a worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus  could materially and adversely affect our ability to control health care costs 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as the hn avian flu  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the impact of a flu pandemic on the united states would likely be substantial 
estimates of the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated avian flu virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative 
a significant global outbreak of avian flu among humans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increased inpatient and outpatient hospital costs and the cost of anti viral medication to treat the virus 
because our corporate headquarters and claims processing facilities are located in southern california  our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake 
our corporate headquarters  centralized claims processing  finance  and information technology support functions are located in long beach  california 
southern california is located along the san andreas fault and is thus exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake than most other parts of the country 
if a major earthquake were to strike the los angeles and long beach area  our claims processing and other corporate functions could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time 
although we have established a disaster recovery and business resumption plan with back up operating sites to be deployed in the case of such a major disruptive event  there can be no assurances that the business operations of all our health plans  including those that are remote from any such event  would not be substantially impacted by a major earthquake 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by both upturns and downturns in general economic conditions 
the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has historically increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
however  during such economic downturns  state and federal tax receipts could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut health care programs  benefits  and rates 
if federal or state funding were decreased while our membership was increasing  our results of operations would be negatively affected 
conversely  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels and profitability to decrease  which could lead to decreases in our operating income 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries  it may negatively affect our business strategy 
we are a corporate parent holding company and hold most of our assets at  and conduct most of our operations through  direct and indirect subsidiaries 
as a holding company  our results of operations depend on the results of 
table of contents operations of our subsidiaries 
moreover  we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries 
in addition  our health plan subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that they can pay to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
in california  our health plan may dividend  without notice to or approval of the california department of managed health care  amounts by which its tangible net equity exceeds of the tangible net equity requirement 
in michigan  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington  our health plans must give thirty days advance notice and the opportunity to disapprove extraordinary dividends to the respective state departments of insurance for amounts over the lesser of a ten percent of surplus or net worth at the prior year end or b the net income for the prior year 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend is not clearly defined 
health plans that declare non extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators ten or fifteen days in advance of the intended distribution date of the non extraordinary dividend 
the aggregate amounts our health plan subsidiaries could have paid us at december    and without approval of the regulatory authorities were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
if the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
for example  we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments under our credit facility and or our senior convertible notes 
unforeseen changes in regulations or pharmaceutical market conditions may impact our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant category of our health care costs relate to pharmaceutical products and services 
evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our hmos to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members 
other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of pharmaceuticals  geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals  and changes in discounts 
the unpredictable nature of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and stock price 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of our future testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time and effort 
moreover  if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse  sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
volatility of our stock price could adversely affect stockholders 
since our initial public offering in july  the sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
a number of factors will continue to influence the market price of our common stock  including state and federal budget decreases  adverse publicity regarding health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations  
table of contents government action regarding member eligibility  changes in government payment levels  a change in control of the presidency or of congress from one party to the other  changes in state mandatory programs  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates  if any  of public market analysts  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  conditions generally affecting the managed care industry or our provider networks  the success of our operating or acquisition strategy  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies in the healthcare industry  the termination of our medicaid or schip contracts with state or county agencies  or subcontracts with other medicaid managed care organizations that contract with such state or county agencies  regulatory or legislative change  and general economic conditions  including inflation  interest rates  and unemployment rates 
our stock may not trade at the same levels as the stock of other health care companies and the market in general may not sustain its current prices 
also  if the trading market for our stock does not continue to develop  securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our shares  and this could further depress the market for our shares 
our directors and officers and members of the molina family own a majority of our capital stock  decreasing the influence of other stockholders on stockholder decisions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our capital stock  and members of the molina family some of whom are also officers or directors  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our capital stock  either directly or in trusts of which members of the molina family are beneficiaries 
in some cases  members of the molina family are trustees of the trusts 
as a result  molina family members  acting by themselves or together with our officers and directors  have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our charter  and any merger  consolidation  or sale of substantially all of our assets 
a significant concentration of share ownership can also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders 
furthermore  the concentration of ownership in our company could delay  defer  or prevent a merger or consolidation  takeover  or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders 
finally  the interests and objectives of our controlling stockholders may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders  and our controlling stockholders may vote their common stock in a manner that may adversely affect our other stockholders 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors  
table of contents prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  and advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
in addition  changes of control are often subject to state regulatory notification  and in some cases  prior approval 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish earnings guidance  forecasts  or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings  and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects numerous assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  our earnings guidance issued on january  assumed that the membership of our ohio hmo would grow during to approximately  members  an assumption which proved to be inaccurate actual membership in ohio grew to  at december  
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this report  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not declared or paid any dividends since our initial public offering in july  and we currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for the development and operation of our business 
accordingly  we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
our ability to deduct interest on our convertible notes for us federal income tax purposes may be reduced or eliminated and as a result our after tax cash flow could be adversely affected 
in october  we completed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due under section of the internal revenue code  deductions otherwise allowable to a corporation for interest may be reduced or eliminated in the case of corporate acquisition indebtedness  which is generally defined to include subordinated convertible debt issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of stock or a substantial portion of the assets of another corporation  if either i the acquiring corporation has a debt to equity ratio measured  in part  with reference to tax basis that exceeds to or ii the projected earnings of the corporation the average annual earnings  determined with certain adjustments  for the three year period ending on the test date do not exceed three times the annual interest costs of the corporation 
at the present time  based on our current and expected operational metrics for the current taxable year as specifically calculated for purposes of the debt to equity ratio and projected earnings tests referred to in the preceding sentence  we do not expect our convertible notes to qualify as corporate acquisition indebtedness 
however  our actual operational metrics could differ from our expectations and  as a result  our deductions for interest on our convertible notes could be reduced or eliminated if our convertible notes meet the definition of corporate acquisition indebtedness in  the taxable year in which the notes were issued 
in addition  our convertible notes could become corporate acquisition indebtedness in a subsequent taxable year if we initially meet the debt to equity ratio and projected earnings tests  but later fail one or both tests in a year during which we issue additional indebtedness for certain corporate acquisitions 
if we are not entitled to deduct interest on our convertible notes  our after tax cash flow could be adversely affected 

table of contents conversion of our senior convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
our convertible notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
the accounting method for convertible debt securities with net share settlement  like our million senior convertible notes  could change in a manner that may affect our results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an exposure draft of a proposed fasb staff position the proposed fsp reflecting new rules that would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments  including our convertible notes 
under the proposed new rules for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
the effect of the proposed new rules for our convertible note is that the equity component would be included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible notes 
higher interest expense would result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of our convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of our convertible notes 
we believe fasb plans to issue final guidance in the first half of this proposed fsp is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   would not permit early application  and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the proposed new rules and cannot quantify the impact at this time 
however  if the proposed fsp is adopted  we expect to have higher interest expense in due to the interest expense accretion  and prior period interest expense associated with our convertible notes would also reflect higher than previously reported interest expense due to retrospective application 
in addition  for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share  a convertible debt security providing for net share settlement upon conversion and meeting specified requirements under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  is currently accounted for in a manner similar to non convertible debt  with the stated coupon constituting interest expense and any shares issuable upon conversion of the security accounted for under the treasury stock method 
the effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares potentially issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes are not included in the calculation of our earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of our convertible notes exceeds their principal amount  in which event  for earnings per share purposes  we would account for the transaction as if we had issued the number of shares of our common stock necessary to settle the conversion 
the proposed fsp does not affect the earnings per share accounting for convertible instruments such as our convertible notes 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
as of december   million of our total million in short term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  they carry a aaa credit rating 
million of the million are secured by student loans which are generally guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
in addition to the us government guarantee on such student loans  some of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals up to days 
recently  auctions for some of these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires 
table of contents the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every   or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
all of these investments are currently classified as short term investments 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not return in the near future  we may be required to reduce the value of these securities through an impairment charge against net income and reflect them as long term investments on our balance sheet for the period ending march  or thereafter 
as of february   the company held million of auction rate securities 
million of these securities are secured by student loans which are generally guaranteed by the us government under ffelp

overview molina healthcare  inc is a multi state managed care organization that arranges for the delivery of health care services to persons eligible for medicaid and other programs for low income families and individuals 
we were founded in as a provider organization serving the medicaid population through a network of primary care clinics in california 
in  we began operating as a health maintenance organization  or hmo 
beginning in january  we began to serve a very small number of our dual eligible members under both the medicaid and the medicare programs we served  medicare members as of december  
we operate our business through health plan subsidiaries in california  michigan  missouri  nevada  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
our financial performance for  and is briefly summarized below dollars in thousands  except per share data year ended december  earnings per diluted share premium revenue operating income net income medical care ratio g a expenses as a percentage of total revenue total ending membership revenue premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our contracts with state medicaid agencies and other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates 
the amount of these premiums may vary substantially between states and among various government programs 
pmpm premiums for members of the state children s health insurance program  or schip  are generally among the company s lowest  with rates as low as approximately pmpm in california and utah 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the temporary aid for needy families tanf medicaid population the medicaid group that includes most mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to over in new mexico and ohio 
among our medicaid aged  blind or disabled  or abd membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in california to over  in new mexico and ohio 
medicare revenue is approximately  pmpm 
approximately of our premium revenue in the year ended december  was realized under a medicaid cost plus reimbursement agreement that our utah plan has with that state 
we also received approximately of our premium revenue for the year ended december  in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in michigan  ohio  texas  and washington 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
starting in  our premium revenue also included premiums generated from medicare  which totaled approximately million for the year ended december  all of our medicare revenue is paid to us as a fixed pmpm amount 
certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates 
chief among these are that portion of premium revenue paid to our new mexico health plan by the state of new mexico that may be refunded to 
table of contents the state if certain minimum amounts are not expended on defined medical care costs  the additional premium revenue our utah health plan is entitled to receive from the state of utah as an incentive payment for saving the state of utah money in relation to fee for service medicaid  and the profit sharing agreement between our texas health plan and the state of texas  where we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income  according to a tiered rebate schedule 
our contract with the state of new mexico requires that we spend a minimum percentage of premium revenue on certain explicitly defined medical care costs 
during  we recorded adjustments totaling million to reduce premium revenue associated with this requirement 
at december   we have recorded a liability of approximately million under our interpretation of the existing terms of this contract provision 
any change to the terms of this provision  including revisions to the definitions of premium revenue or medical care costs  the period of time over which the minimum percentage is measured or the manner of its measurement  or the percentage of revenue required to be spent on the defined medical care costs  may trigger a change in this amount 
if the state of new mexico disagrees with our interpretation of the existing contract terms  an adjustment to this amount may occur 
the medicaid contract of our utah health plan with the state of utah is paid on a cost plus nine percent basis 
in addition  in order to incentivize the plan to save the state money  the contract also entitles the health plan to be paid a percentage of the savings realized as measured against what claims would have been paid on a fee for service basis by the state 
we had previously estimated the amount that we believe our utah plan will recover under its savings sharing agreement with the state of utah 
however  as a result of an ongoing disagreement with the state  during our utah health plan wrote off the entire receivable  totaling million  million of which was accrued as of december  nevertheless  our utah health plan has not waived any of its rights to recovery under the savings sharing provision of the contract  and continues to work with the state in an effort to assure an appropriate determination of amounts due 
when additional information is known or agreement is reached with the state regarding the appropriate savings sharing payment amount  we will adjust the amount of savings sharing revenue recorded in our financial statements 
as of december   we have accrued a liability of approximately million pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas  for the and contract years 
because the final settlement calculations include a claims run out period of nearly one year  the amounts recorded  based on our estimates  may be adjusted 
we believe that the ultimate settlement will not differ materially from our estimate 
historically  membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing revenues  although more recently our revenues have also grown due to the more care intensive benefits associated with our abd and dual eligible members 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions

expenses our operating expenses include expenses related to the provision of medical care services and general and administrative  or g a  expenses 
our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health care services and to accurately estimate costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
we pay hospitals in a variety of ways  including per diem amounts  diagnostic related groups or drgs  percent of billed charges  case rates  and capitation 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitation basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed pmpm payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit managers 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 
other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance cost  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  and a portion of our information technology costs 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses 
for the years ended december   and  medically related administrative costs were approximately million  million  and million  respectively

g a expenses largely consist of wage and benefit costs for our employees  premium taxes  and other administrative expenses 
some g a services are provided locally  while others are delivered to our health plans from a centralized location 
the primary centralized functions are claims processing  information systems  finance and accounting services  and legal and regulatory services 
locally provided functions include member services  plan administration  and provider relations

the medical care ratio for the abd population for all of was 
we expect that the ohio abd medical care ratio will decrease in as a result of the rate increase the health plan received under its abd contract with the state effective january   and the realization of improved utilization as the transition to managed care continues 
we estimate that if the medical care ratio for the cfc population remains at 
table of contents for all of  we will need to achieve a medical care ratio of for our abd population to reach our expectation of an medical care ratio plan wide for ohio 
the recent addition of the abd members some of whom were not added until late summer of adds a degree of uncertainty to the medical care cost estimates in ohio that is not found in our more mature health plans  the medical care ratio of the texas health plan decreased in primarily due to very low medical costs for the star plus membership 
as noted above  we recorded a million reduction to revenue in texas during to reflect estimated amounts due back to the state under a profit sharing arrangement 
we believe that the medical care ratio reported by the texas health plan in is not sustainable  and expect the medical care ratio to rise during to a level consistent with consolidated results  the medical care ratio of the utah health plan increased due to the write off of million in savings share receivables in the second half of medical care costs in utah decreased on a pmpm basis in when compared to absent the write off of million in savings share receivable in the second half of million of which was accrued as of december   the utah health plan s medical care ratio would have been  an improvement over the reported for our utah health plan serves the majority of its membership under a cost plus contract with the state of utah  the medical care ratio reported at the washington health plan increased to in from in  principally due to higher fee for service costs  and the termination of our operations in indiana resulted in a basis point improvement in our medical care ratio  to  in absent the impact of the indiana plan in both years  the medical care ratio in would have increased basis points to from in general and administrative expenses g a expenses were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of total revenue  for included in g a expenses were premium taxes totaling million in and million in premium taxes increased in due to increased revenues in the states where premium taxes are assessed

as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our michigan  new mexico  utah  and washington health plan subsidiaries 
the amended credit facility includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  investments  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to at any time 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our principal operations are conducted through our nine health plan subsidiaries operating in california  michigan  missouri  nevada  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
the health plans are subject to state laws that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to molina healthcare  inc as the sole stockholder of each of our health plans 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  
table of contents advances  or cash dividends totaled million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has established model rules which  if adopted by a particular state  set minimum capitalization requirements for health plans and other insurance entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
these rules  which vary slightly from state to state  have been adopted in michigan  nevada  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
california has not adopted rbc rules and has not given notice of any intention to do so 
the rbc rules  if adopted by california  may increase the minimum capital required by that state 
at december   our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared to the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our health plans were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements at december  we have the ability and commitment to provide additional working capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements through critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr claims reserve  as reported in our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnr monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
our estimated ibnr liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding ibnr related to our utah health plan  where we are reimbursed on a cost plus basis  our ibnr liability at december  was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnr include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnr liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate ibnr  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnr is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure 
table of contents the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah health plan is excluded from these calculations  because the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost plus reimbursement contract 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in increase decrease in estimated medical claims and completion factors benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december   that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  because the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost plus reimbursement contract 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in decrease increase in trended per member per month medical claims and cost estimates benefits payable assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  net of tax  and million  or per diluted share  net of tax  respectively 
it is important to note that any error in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by an error in the estimate of the other component  and that an error in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
for example  if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of net 
table of contents income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnr reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  which also uses actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnr 
it is intended to capture the adverse development of factors such as the speed of claims payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind and disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which much of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnr after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnr liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnr is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnr 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnr liability and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments  if appropriate  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past most recently during the second quarter of been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
specifically  completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that base reserves have been adequately set  we believe that amounts ultimately paid out should generally be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
however  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to range  as shown by our results in and when the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of our established reserves by approximately and  respectively 
as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our liabilities recorded at both december  and were less than what we had expected when we established our reserves 
while the specific reasons for the overestimation of our liabilities were different at each of the two reporting dates  in general the overestimations were tied to our assessment of specific circumstances at our various individual health plans which were unique to those reporting periods 

table of contents in  overestimation of the claims liability at our michigan  new mexico  and washington health plans at december  led to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development  which benefit was partially offset by the underestimation of our claims liability at december  at our california and indiana health plans 
in both michigan and washington  we overestimated in the second half of the impact of the upward trend in medical costs observed during the first half of  resulting in an overestimation of the liability of those plans at december  in new mexico  during the second half of the year with respect to medical and drug costs associated with providing care related to behavioral health conditions  we underestimated the impact that the state s assumption of financial responsibility for costs related to the treatment of those behavioral health conditions would have on our claims liability at december   resulting in our overestimating that liability 
in california  we underestimated costs associated with our members in san diego county  a market we had first entered only seven months earlier 
additionally  a claims system upgrade during delayed claims processing and distorted our normal payment pattern for claims 
both of these circumstances led us to underestimate our claim liability at december  in indiana  we underestimated medical costs in a state where we had only begun operations earlier in  leading us to underestimate our claims liability at december  in  overestimation of the claims liability at our california  new mexico  and washington health plans at december   led to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development  which benefit was partially offset by the underestimation of our claims liability at december  at our michigan health plan 
in california  we underestimated the impact of changes to certain provider contracts implemented during the second half of which lowered medical costs further than we had anticipated  leading us to overestimate our claims liability at december  in washington  we overestimated the impact of the upward trend in medical costs during the latter half of additionally  we lowered claims inventory in december in anticipation of a claims system upgrade in early while we attempted to adjust our claims liability estimation procedures for the increased speed of claims payment  we were only partially successful in doing so 
both of these circumstances led us to overestimate our claims liability at december  in michigan  we underestimated the upward trend in medical costs during the latter half of additionally  we underestimated the costs associated with the membership we had added as a result of our acquisition of cape health plan in may we do not believe that the recognition of a benefit or detriment from prior period claims development had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in either or in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the impact of the following factors which we believe are reasonably likely to change our final claims liability amount the addition during of a substantial number of aged  blind or disabled abd members to our ohio health  which members incur higher medical costs than do our members in other categories 
our assessment regarding the impact of some overpayments made to certain ohio providers in and and the impact of those overpayments on reported medical cost trends 
uncertainties regarding the impact of state mandated changes to hospital fee schedules implemented in washington in august uncertainties regarding the impact of state mandated changes to the methodology used to pay outpatient claims in michigan during 
table of contents the addition to our california provider network during of a hospital that serves high cost patients  as well as changes implemented in september to our contract with a leading childrens hospital that provides care to a significant number of our california members 
the addition in november of approximately  members in sacramento county  california where we have traditionally experienced higher medical costs 
changes we made during to our pharmacy formulary in california in response to competitive pressures 
costs associated with our newly acquired membership in missouri  as well as the impact of any difference between our claims payment policies and those used by the prior management of our missouri health plan 
increases in claims inventory at our california  new mexico  and texas health plans during the fourth quarter of decreases in claims inventory at our michigan and washington health plans during the fourth quarter of any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period through general and administrative expense will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
however  that benefit will affect current period earnings only to the extent that the replenishment of the reserve for adverse claims development and the re accrual of administrative costs for the settlement of those claims is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period liability 
we seek to maintain a consistent claims reserving methodology across all periods 
accordingly  any prior period benefit from an un utilized reserve for adverse claims development would likely be offset by the establishment of a new reserve in an approximately equal amount relative to premium revenue  medical care costs  and medical claims and benefits payable in the current period  and thus the impact on earnings for the current period would likely be minimal 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable for the years ended december  and the negative amounts displayed for components of medical care costs related to prior years represent the amount by which our original estimate of claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period exceeded the actual amount of the liability based on information principally the payment of claims developed since that liability was first reported 
the benefit of this prior period development may be offset by the addition of a reserve for adverse claims development when estimating the liability at the end of the period captured as a component of medical care costs related to current year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our health plans operate 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments of million  and restricted investments of million 
the cash equivalents consist of highly liquid securities with original or purchase date remaining maturities of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
as of december   our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities  all of which were classified as current assets 
our investment policies require that all of our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate and variable rate securities where interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
the restricted investments consist of interest bearing deposits and treasury securities required by the respective states in which we operate 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
all non restricted investments are reported at fair market value on the balance sheet 
all restricted investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
as of december   million of our total million in short term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  they carry an aaa credit rating 
million of the million are secured by student loans which are 
table of contents generally guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
in addition to the us government guarantee on such student loans  some of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals up to days 
recently  auctions for some of these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every   or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
all of these investments are currently classified as short term investments 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not return in the near future  we may be required to reduce the value of these securities through an impairment charge against net income and reflect them as long term investments on our balance sheet for the period ending march  or thereafter 
as of february   the company held million of auction rate securities 
million of these securities are secured by student loans which are generally guaranteed by the us government under ffelp 
inflation althought the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs
