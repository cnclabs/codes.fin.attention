item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we currently have four clinical development programs  including three late stage clinical programs arcalyst tm rilonacept  also known as il trap in various inflammatory indications  aflibercept vegf trap in oncology  and the vegf trap eye formulation in eye diseases using intraocular delivery 
aflibercept is being developed in oncology in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
the vegf trap eye is being developed in collaboration with bayer healthcare llc 
our fourth clinical development program is regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r that entered clinical development in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the fourth quarter of we expect that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary technologies for developing human monoclonal antibodies 
our antibody program is being conducted in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  and cardiovascular diseases 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates and we may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  and source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of the vegf trap eye and arcalyst tm  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs utilizing our technology for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
also  our activities may expand over time and require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we are reimbursed for some of these research and development activities by our collaborators 
our principal sources of cash to date have been from sales of common equity and convertible debt and from funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  and payments for our research and development activities 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
in  we expect these expenses to increase substantially as we i expand our research and preclinical and clinical development activities in connection with our new antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  ii expand our phase vegf trap eye clinical program and our arcalyst tm and aflibercept clinical programs  and iii increase our research and development headcount 
due to our new antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  we expect a greater proportion of our research and development expenses to be funded by our collaborators in than in a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared with in and in in our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded development programs for the vegf trap eye and arcalyst tm and our plans to move our first antibody candidate into clinical trials 
in  our average headcount decreased primarily as a result of reductions made in the fourth quarter of and mid year in these workforce reductions were associated with narrowing the focus of our research and development efforts  substantial improvements in manufacturing productivity  the june expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble  and the completion of contract manufacturing for merck in october in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately primarily to support the expansion of our research and development activities as described above  especially in connection with our new antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and plans for are as follows product candidate events events plans arcalyst tm rilonacept  also known as il trap completed the week open label safety extension phase of the phase trial in caps fda accepted bla submission for caps granted orphan drug designation in caps in european union reported positive results in exploratory proof of concept study in patients with chronic active gout initiated phase trial evaluating safety and efficacy of arcalyst tm in preventing gout induced flares in patients initiating allopurinol therapy receive fda review decision on bla submission for caps expected at the end of february if marketing approval is obtained  launch arcalyst tm commercially in caps evaluate arcalyst tm in certain other disease indications in which il may play an important role aflibercept vegf trap oncology sanofi aventis initiated four phase trials of aflibercept in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens nci ctep initiated studies of aflibercept reported interim results from phase single agent trials in advanced ovarian cancer and in non small cell lung adenocarcinoma initiated japanese phase trial of aflibercept in combination with another investigational agent in patients with solid malignancies sanofi aventis to initiate a fifth phase study of aflibercept in combination with standard chemotherapy regimen report final data from phase single agent trials in advanced ovarian cancer and in non small cell lung adenocarcinoma complete enrollment of phase single agent study in symptomatic malignant ascites sma report interim data from the sma phase trial nci ctep to begin to report data from trials nci ctep to initiate additional exploratory safety and efficacy studies vegf trap eye intravitreal injection initiated first phase trial in wet amd in patients in the us and canada reported positive primary endpoint results and preliminary extended treatment results of phase trial in wet amd reported positive results in phase trial in dme initiate second phase trial in wet amd in the european union and certain other countries around the world explore additional eye disease indications product candidate events events plans antibodies entered global  strategic collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis to discover  develop  and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies initiated phase trial for regn in rheumatoid arthritis initiate phase trial for the dll antibody in oncology report data for phase trial of regn in rheumatoid arthritis advance a third antibody candidate into clinical development collaborations our current collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  and our expired agreement with the procter gamble company  are summarized below

accounting for stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  in  we recognized compensation expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards using graded vesting  which is an accelerated expense recognition method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense for regeneron is recognized for a all share based payments granted on or after january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results were not restated 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  and requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment including stock options and restricted stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited at the time of grant and to revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
effective january   and prior to our adoption of sfas r  we recognized the effect of forfeitures in stock based compensation cost in the period when they occurred  in accordance with sfas upon adoption of sfas r effective january   we were required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards that were not expected to vest as of the sfas r adoption date 
this adjustment reduced our loss by million and is included in our operating results for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle 
exclusive of the cumulative effect adjustment  the effect of the change from applying the provisions of sfas to applying the provisions of sfas r on our loss from operations  net loss  and net loss per share for the year ended december  was not significant  and there was no impact to our cash flows for the year ended december  non cash stock based employee compensation expense related to stock option awards stock option expense recognized in operating expenses totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  for the year ended december   million of stock option expense was capitalized into inventory 
as of december   there was million of stock based compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures  which had not yet been recognized in operating expenses 
we expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  there are  options which are unvested as of december  and would become vested upon our products achieving certain sales targets and the optionee satisfying certain service conditions 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options totals million and will begin to be recognized only if  and when  these options performance condition is considered to be probable of attainment 
assumptions we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions we used in computing the fair value of option grants during   and expected volatility expected lives from grant date years years years expected dividend yield risk free interest rate changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in any period

in the fourth quarter of  when we commenced recognizing cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses  we recognized as additional research and development expense a cumulative catch up of million of vegf trap eye development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to bayer healthcare 
payroll and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above  annual compensation increases effective in  and higher stock option expense  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our phase study of the vegf trap eye in wet amd  which we initiated in the third quarter of  and our ongoing phase and studies of the vegf trap eye in wet amd 
clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher costs related to manufacturing arcalyst tm and preclinical and clinical supplies of regn  which were partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept and the vegf trap eye 
research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to our human monoclonal antibody programs  including regn  and utilization of our proprietary technology platforms 
occupancy and other operating costs primarily increased in connection with higher company headcount and to support our expanded research and development activities 
we budget our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project 
we also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  stock option expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  increase project costs decrease in millions arcalyst tm aflibercept vegf trap eye regn other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a biologics license application or bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
for example  we  and our collaborators  where applicable  continue to explore further development of arcalyst tm  aflibercept  and the vegf trap eye in different disease indications 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors under risks related to development of our product candidates  regulatory and litigation risks  and risks related to commercialization of products 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate product revenues and material net cash inflows 
in the second quarter of  we submitted a bla for arcalyst tm for the treatment of caps  a group of rare genetic disorders 
we cannot predict whether or when the commercialization of arcalyst tm in caps will result in a material net cash inflow to us 
contract manufacturing expenses we had no contract manufacturing expenses in compared to million in  due to the expiration of our manufacturing agreement with merck in october general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the same period of primarily due to i higher stock option expense  as described above  ii higher compensation expense principally due to annual increases effective in and higher administrative headcount to support our expanded research and development activities  iii recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount in  iv higher fees for consultants and other professional services on various corporate matters  and v market research and related expenses incurred in in connection with our arcalyst tm and vegf trap eye programs 
other income and expense investment income increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from higher balances of cash and marketable securities due  in part  to the up front payment received from bayer healthcare in october  as described above  and the receipt of net proceeds from the november public offering of our common stock 
this increase was partly offset by a million charge in related to marketable securities which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value 
in the second half of  deterioration in the credit quality of marketable securities from two issuers has subjected us to the risk of being unable to recover their full principal value  which totals million

payroll and benefits decreased principally due to our lower headcount in in addition  payroll and benefits in and included million and million  respectively  of severance costs associated with our workforce reduction plan that we initiated in october clinical trial expenses decreased primarily due to lower arcalyst tm costs in as we discontinued clinical development of arcalyst tm in adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in the second half of this decrease was partly offset by higher vegf trap eye costs related to phase and phase clinical trials that we are conducting in wet amd 
clinical manufacturing costs decreased because of lower costs in related to manufacturing arcalyst tm clinical supplies  which were partially offset by higher costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies 
research and preclinical development costs decreased principally because of lower costs for general research supplies in as we narrowed the focus of our research and development efforts due  in part  to the expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble in june  as described above

astrazeneca and astellas are each required to make up to five additional annual payments of million  subject to each licensee s ability to terminate its license agreement with us after making the first three additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance criteria 
severance costs in september  we announced plans to reduce our workforce by approximately employees in connection with narrowing the focus of our research and development efforts  substantial improvements in manufacturing productivity  the september expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble  and the completion of contract manufacturing for merck in late the majority of the headcount reduction occurred in the fourth quarter of the remaining headcount reductions occurred in as we completed activities related to contract manufacturing for merck 
costs associated with the workforce reduction were comprised principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes  employee benefits  and outplacement services 
termination costs related to workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth quarter of  and included million of non cash expenses 
estimated termination costs associated with the workforce reduction in were measured in october and expensed ratably over the expected service period of the affected employees in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
total costs associated with the and workforce reductions were million  of which million was charged to expense in the fourth quarter of and million was charged to expense in convertible debt in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement and received proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and out of pocket expenses  of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature in the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
if the price per share of our common stock is above at maturity  we would expect the notes would be converted into shares of common stock 
otherwise  we will be required to repay the million aggregate principal amount of the notes or refinance the notes prior to maturity  however  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully arrange such refinancing 
new operating lease tarrytown  new york facilities we currently lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york under operating lease agreements 
in december  we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space at our current tarrytown location 
the new lease includes approximately  square feet that we currently occupy our retained facilities and approximately  square feet to be located in new facilities that are under construction and expected to be completed in mid in  we amended the december operating lease agreement to increase the amount of new space we will lease from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet  for an amended total under the new lease of approximately  square feet 
the term of the lease is now expected to commence in mid and will expire approximately years later 
under the new lease we also have various options and rights on additional space at the tarrytown site  and will continue to lease our present facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy 
in addition  the lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options for our retained facilities only 
the lease provides for monthly payments over the term of the lease related to our retained facilities  the costs of construction and tenant improvements for our new facilities  and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses 
in connection with the new lease agreement  in december  we issued a letter of credit in the amount of million to our landlord  which is collateralized by a million bank certificate of deposit 
capital expenditures our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in in  we expect to incur approximately to million in capital expenditures primarily in connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities and tenant improvements and related costs in connection with our new tarrytown operating lease  as described above 
we expect that approximately million of projected tarrytown tenant improvement costs will be reimbursed by our landlord in connection with our new operating lease 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately  million 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements  such as those with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  and agreements to use our velocigene technology platform 
we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
before taking into account reimbursements from collaborators  we currently anticipate that approximately of our expenditures for will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including arcalyst tm  aflibercept  vegf trap eye  and monoclonal antibodies including regn and the dll antibody  approximately of our expenditures for will be applied to our basic research and early preclinical activities and the remainder of our expenditures for will be used for the continued development of our novel technology platforms  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  these obligations and commitments assume non termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period less than to to greater than total one year years years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes amounts representing interest 
includes projected obligations based  in part  upon budgeted construction and tenant improvement costs related to our new operating lease for facilities under construction in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  respectively 
profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed upon expenses 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  royalties on product sales in japan otherwise payable to us unless we agree to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate at our option 
given the uncertainties related to drug development including the development of aflibercept and co developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi aventis and the vegf trap eye in collaboration with bayer healthcare such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare will become profitable 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet operating needs through at least however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
other than the million letter of credit issued to our landlord in connection with our new operating lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business

non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i the nature  timing  and value of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related development product candidate  ii the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  and iii the relative level of risk in achieving the milestone  taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our vegf trap eye collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with sanofi aventis 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as contract research and development revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in addition  we record revenue in connection with a government research grant using a proportional performance model as we incur expenses related to the grant  subject to the grant s terms and annual funding approvals 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are possible  and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  performance periods may be extended if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand our clinical plans for a drug candidate into additional disease indications 
also  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
for the year ended december   changes in estimates of our performance periods  including an extension of our estimated performance period for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  did not have a material impact on contract research and development revenue that we recognized 
for the year ended december   we recognized million less in contract research and development revenue  compared to amounts recognized in  in connection with million of non refundable up front payments previously received from sanofi aventis pursuant to the companies aflibercept collaboration  due to an extension of our estimated performance period 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by contract research organizations cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue on an estimated cost per patient basis an expense based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december  or depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
the estimated useful lives of property  plant  and equipment are as follows building and improvements years laboratory and computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
costs of construction of certain long lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  in  we recognized compensation expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards using graded vesting  which is an accelerated expense recognition method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense for regeneron is recognized for a all share based payments granted on or after january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results have not been restated 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  and requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment including stock options and restricted stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited at the time of grant and to revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
effective january   and prior to our adoption of sfas r  we recognized the effect of forfeitures in stock based compensation cost in the period when they occurred  in accordance with sfas upon adoption of sfas r effective january   we were required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards that were not expected to vest as of the sfas r adoption date 
this adjustment reduced our loss by million and is included in our operating results for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   however on december   the fasb issued a proposed staff position fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we are required to adopt sfas as it relates to our financial assets and financial liabilities effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and as it relates to our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for the fiscal year beginning january  our management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are required to adopt sfas effective for the fiscal year beginning january  our management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force issued statement no 
 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses how entities involved in research and development activities should account for the non refundable portion of an advance payment made for future research and development activities and requires that such payments be deferred and capitalized  and recognized as an expense when the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are required to adopt eitf effective for the fiscal year beginning january  our management does not anticipate that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate  asset backed  and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would result in approximately a million and million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the potential impact of an interest rate change at december   compared to december   is due primarily to slight increases in our investment portfolio s duration to maturity at the end of versus the end of credit quality risk we have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities  minimum credit quality  maturity parameters  and concentration and diversification 
nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
in  we recognized a million charge related to marketable securities which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value
