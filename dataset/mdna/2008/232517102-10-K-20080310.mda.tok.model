item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  semiconductor dram memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
we expect these cycles to be more moderate in the future  reflecting the mature nature of the global electronics market 
the worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong in  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
in addition  the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold also remained strong 
these factors combined to drive an increase in demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
demand for our products started to increase in the third quarter of  continued to improve throughout the first quarter of  and then leveled off at lower  but still favorable levels  for the remainder of and the first quarter of orders increased again in the second and third quarters of  before leveling off again in the fourth quarter of our consolidated revenues increased in from to million 
revenue growth for both and has been impacted by pricing pressure from competitors  particularly in asia  causing us to continue to expend funds for development of next generation products that we anticipate will compete more favorably 
income from operations for declined by to million from million in  due in part to a million or increase in research and development expenditures for next generation smt system products and enhancements to existing smt system products 
revenue and our operating results in increased significantly compared to in response to upturns in both the electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets that began in the third quarter of and continued throughout the worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics continued to increase throughout driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
our consolidated revenues for increased from to million 
income from operations for  benefiting from the higher level of revenue and a lower cost structure implemented in during the last severe downturn in the electronic assembly market  improved to million from million in in february  we announced plans to move our systems related research and development and manufacturing operations over the next months to singapore  the location of our asian sales offices 
the move will enable us to become more responsive to the needs of our growing base of asian smt systems customers  permit core optical engineering resources in minneapolis to work on anticipated new oem opportunities  and attain future cost savings 
we estimate costs associated with the transition in of up to million 
we anticipate future annual research and development savings from this transition of million per year 
during  as a result of our lower cost structure and history of improved profitability  we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes that had been established in the third quarter of the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of of million 
see note of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
our balance sheet is also well positioned as the result of improved operating results and effective management of working capital and other assets 
we have no debt and cash and marketable securities of million at december  compared to million at december  segment results our business consists of two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments 
the electronic assembly segment designs  manufactures and sells optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly equipment market 

table of contents the semiconductor segment designs  manufactures and sells optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly semiconductor total gross margin electronic assembly semiconductor total operating expense electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations electronic assembly semiconductor total income from operations interest income and other income before income taxes revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly oem sensors smt systems total electronic assembly semiconductor total electronic assembly revenues from our electronic assembly sensors were down million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to during and  revenue from electronic assembly sensors were positively impacted by favorable worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
in addition  the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold remained strong 
these factors combined to drive an increase in demand for our electronic assembly sensors in and compared to revenues from electronic assembly sensors were down slightly in compared to due in part to fluctuations in the market share of our key electronic assembly sensor customers 
increasing competition and sales price pressure may have a larger impact on our revenue from electronic assembly sensors in the future  as manufacturers of electronics continually seek to reduce their costs  including the cost of capital equipment incorporating our electronic assembly sensors  resulting in price pressure on our sensor products 

table of contents revenues from our smt systems products increased million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to like our sensor revenue  revenue from our smt system products was positively impacted during and by favorable worldwide demand for electronics and favorable conditions in the countries where most of our products are sold 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused increased demand for our inspection equipment 
however  our revenue has been impacted by increasing competition and price pressure on our smt inspection systems  particularly in asia 
revenue from our systems products in and were also positively impacted by the introduction of our new improved se ultra solder paste inspection system in  our improved flex ultra aoi system in the first quarter of  and our flex ultra hr system in sales of our se and se ultra solder paste inspection systems increased million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to sales of our flex aoi systems increased million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to export revenue from electronic assembly sensors and smt systems totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising of electronic assembly revenue in  of electronic assembly revenue in  and of electronic assembly revenue in an increasing proportion of our sales have been to international customers as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
we believe the market trend toward automated inspection using smt inspection systems is continuing to grow and emerge due to ongoing miniaturization of smt circuit board components 
required for downsizing products  some new generation components have become so small that it is now virtually impossible for the human eye to inspect circuit boards for defects in solder paste quality  component placement and solder joints 
for this reason  we believe automated inspection has become the only viable means for inspecting smt circuit boards with such tiny components  and we believe that our smt systems products will be one of our primary growth drivers over the next few years 
semiconductor revenues from semiconductor products decreased by million or in compared to and increased by million or in compared to the decrease in was due to difficult conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment  partially offset by additional revenue from our new wafersense family of products 
total wafersense revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in was due to improved conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market that began late in the fourth quarter of  resulting in higher revenues from our wafer mapping sensors and new wafersense products 
revenues from our frame grabber products increased slightly in compared to our wafer mapping and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our new wafersense products 
wafersense is a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we have recently introduced several new additions to the wafersense product line  including additional leveling sensors  along with new gapping  teaching and vibration sensors 
export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of total semiconductor revenue in  million or of total semiconductor revenue in and million or of total semiconductor revenue in the level of international sales and percentage of sales coming from international markets did not change substantially when comparing to the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue in compared to is due to increased sales of frame grabbers in europe 
in addition  our wafer mapping sensors do not generate significant international sales 
fluctuations in the sales level of these products can also cause fluctuations in our international revenue  as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue 

table of contents adoption of sfas no 
r prior to january   we accounted for equity based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
as a result  no compensation expense for equity based awards was recognized in our statement of operations prior to the first quarter of  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the award on the date of grant  and our employee stock purchase plan was deemed to be non compensatory under apb no 
results of operations for fiscal year and prior periods have not been restated to reflect recognition of compensation expense for equity based awards 
during the first quarter of  we began recording compensation expense for equity based awards as required by sfas no 
r 
the following table sets forth compensation expense pre tax by segment for our equity based awards for the years ended december  and and should be considered when comparing the results of operations for to and to twelve months ended december  and in thousands electronic assembly semiconductor total cost of revenue research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total gross margin electronic assembly gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales were in  in and in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to was due to increasing competition resulting in lower sales prices for our electronic assembly products  particularly our smt system products 
increased competition and resulting price pressure on our smt system products reduced gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales in by four percentage points  offset in part by a one percentage point improvement from cost reduction programs 
increasing price competition for our electronic assembly sensor products also impacted our gross margin 
the gross margin decrease in resulting from the increase in price competition was partially offset by a million benefit from a warranty recovery 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales is generally lower for our system products as compared to our sensor products 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to was due to increasing competition resulting in lower sales prices for our electronic assembly products  particularly our smt system products 
increased competition and resulting price pressure for our smt system products reduced gross margin by approximately one percentage point 
the remaining decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in was due to a million inventory write down of a non oem sensor product  increasing price competition for our other electronic assembly sensor products  and changes in mix of products sold 
as the market for automated inspection has continued to grow and emerge  additional competitors have entered the marketplace for these products 
although we believe our smt system products compete favorably against these competitive products on the basis of performance and reliability  the introduction of lower price competitive models has required us to decrease the selling price of our products in some markets 
with respect to our systems products we anticipate that pricing pressures will continue in due to the additional competition in the marketplace for all forms of automated circuit board inspection 
we have implemented our own cost reduction programs to reduce the impact of these pricing pressures on our gross margins 
in addition  we believe that systems platforms we introduce in the future based on new technology will allow for improvement in margins 
semiconductor gross margin as a percentage of sales were in  in and in gross margin as a percentage of sales for the semiconductor segment is dependent on revenue mix and the level of production volume over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in and due to a change in revenue 
table of contents mix  with our highest margin wafer mapping sensors representing a smaller percentage of total semiconductor revenue 
in addition  revenue from our lower margin leveling sensor products was up in both and compared to the prior year 
we currently expect gross margins as a percentage of revenue from our semiconductor products to remain consistent or increase slightly in from levels  due to anticipated revenue from new wafersense product introductions as these products have slightly higher gross margins than our existing products 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment and development of our sales channels  is critical to future growth and profitability 
we maintain research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
in february  we announced plans to move our systems related research and development and manufacturing operations over the next months to singapore  the location of our asian sales offices 
the move will enable us to become more responsive to the needs of our growing base of asian smt systems customers  permit core optical engineering resources in minneapolis to work on anticipated new oem opportunities  and attain future cost savings 
we estimate costs associated with the transition in of up to million 
we anticipate future annual research and development savings from this transition of approximately million per year 
we are continually evaluating existing and new research and development projects  and may elect to increase or decrease expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of these projects 
electronic assembly research and development expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense in compared to was due to increased costs for contract labor of million  excluding customer funded expenses  million for employee compensation associated with annual wage increases and new employees  and million for proto type expenses and lab supplies 
a significant portion of our product development efforts in were targeted at next generation smt inspection system products and continued enhancements to our se ultra solder paste inspection system and flex ultra and flex ultra hr automated optical inspection systems 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to was due to increased compensation costs of million  including increases in company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit  and stock compensation costs resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the remaining increase in research and development expense in was due to higher costs for other expenses related to our development projects  such as travel  occupancy and supplies 
during we completed development of our th generation laseralign sensor for juki s industry leading line of pick and place machines 
early in we introduced an enhanced version of our flex series automated optical inspection system  the flex ultra 
we continued to make improvements to our se ultra and flex ultra smt products throughout  including improvements for speed  measurement performance  and reliability 
we also continued work on our epv technological initiative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to a million increase in sales commissions to distributors and other third parties and a million increase in travel 
we also incurred million of expenses in from a cancelled acquisition 
these cost increases along with the remaining increase in cost were due to the increase in smt system sales in compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to increased compensation costs of million  including increases for company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit  stock compensation expense resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r  plus additional field sales and applications support personnel required to generate the higher level of smt systems sales in travel costs were higher in due to the additional field sales and support headcount added in and 
table of contents semiconductor research and development expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in  and million or of revenue in from through  we continued to develop various new sensors for our wafersense family of precision measurement tools  including new automated leveling  gapping  teaching and vibration sensors to assist with process optimization and yield improvement in the semiconductor fabrication process 
research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to due to lower compensation costs for incentive compensation 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to is due to increased compensation costs for company wide incentive compensation programs and stock compensation expense resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was due to lower wage expense resulting from a planned reduction in various marketing and administrative positions  and lower costs for incentive compensation 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to is due to costs for additional management  higher sales commissions  equity compensation costs resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r and company wide incentive compensation costs resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment was million in  and we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment to be million in amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment was million in  million in and million in the decrease in semiconductor related amortization was due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during and we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment to be less than million in interest income and other interest income and other primarily includes interest earned on investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions 
interest income and other increased during and as the result of additional invested funds and higher rates of interest earned on those funds 
income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
fasb interpretation no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
on january   we recognized less than a million increase in our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  with a corresponding decrease in beginning retained earnings  for uncertain tax positions that existed at december   but previously did not meet the requirements for liability recognition under sfas no 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million increase in liabilities  net of deferred tax benefit  for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense 
estimated interest and penalties included in this amount total less than million 
at december   we have million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  compared to million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at adoption date 
our reserve for income taxes  including gross interest and penalties  was million at january  and million at december   which would reduce income tax expense and our effective tax rate if recognized 
consistent with the requirements of fin no 
 our net unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as a long term liability in our balance sheet 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 

table of contents we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carry forwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carry back benefit in from the third quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
our tax benefit for  including reversal of the valuation allowance  was equal to million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carry forwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that a reduction in the valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from carry forwards and deductible temporary differences has been reflected as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
since the reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  our effective tax rate has more closely approximated the us federal statutory tax rate 
our worldwide effective income tax rate for was compared to for our effective tax rate was higher in compared to due to elimination of the extra territorial income exclusion in and a million income tax benefit recorded in from favorable resolution of a tax contingency accrual for prior year s income taxes  resulting from the closing of a domestic statute of limitations 
a reduction in the united kingdom income tax rate  reducing the value of our deferred tax assets and increasing tax expense in by less than million  was offset by a slight decrease in the amount of fin no 
liabilities recorded in liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during primarily because of purchases of million of marketable securities  net of maturities  million of cash generated from operating activities  purchases of million of capital assets  and repurchases of million of common stock  partly offset by million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
our combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  doubtful accounts and deferred taxes  foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase in advance customer payments of million 
this cash generated was offset partly by increases in inventory of million and other assets of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to a heightened emphasis on collections during the fourth quarter of the increase in advance customer payments is due to more sales to customers who pay prior to recognition of revenue 
inventories were up due to a shift in the mix of products sold compared to our original sales forecast 
other assets were higher because of more value added and income tax refunds due from various governmental authorities 
the decrease in accounts payable is the result of the timing of inventory purchases 
inventory purchases were down in the fourth quarter of compared to  resulting in a reduction in the accounts payable balance  as payments for inventory exceeded new purchases 
we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  doubtful accounts and deferred taxes  foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities included increases in accounts payable of million and increases in accrued expenses of million 
this cash generated was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of million and decreases in advance customer payments of million 
increases in accounts payable are the result of inventory purchases to support additional customer evaluations of our smt system products 
the increase in accrued expenses resulted from the accrual 
table of contents of company wide incentive compensation costs due to higher levels of revenue and profit in and increases in warranty reserves resulting from higher revenue levels 
increases in accounts receivable are due to higher revenue levels in  compared to the decrease in advance customer payments is due to lower sales from customers who pay prior to our recognition of revenue from the related sale 
we used million of cash for investing activities in compared to million of cash provided by investing activities in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases and maturities of those securities  used million of cash in and provided million of cash in we used million of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
we used million of cash for financing activities in compared to million of cash for financing activities in stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan generated million of cash in compared to million of cash in the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options were minimal in and generated million of cash in during  million of cash was used to repurchase common stock compared to common stock repurchases of million in at december   we had authority to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program for a total of  shares approved by our board of directors in october subsequent to december   our board approved an additional  share stock repurchase program for a one year period commencing february  future repurchases under this authorization are expected to be a use of cash in at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed below 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility 
the lease for this space is set to expire in june we are close to finalizing a new three year lease for a mixed office and warehouse facility in singapore 
the annual rent for this facility is approximately  per year 
purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential payments for uncertain tax positions under fin no 
as a result  the preceding table excludes any potential future payments related to our fin no 
liability for uncertain tax positions 
see note for further discussion on income taxes 

table of contents related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
in general  because the dollar has declined during the past few years relative to local currency  the currency fluctuations have enhanced our competitive position 
this has been largely offset by the entrance of other companies in our markets who compete with us on the basis of price 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that day 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   the losses from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements and the transaction gain on the underlying inter company balance were not significant 
we have sales offices located in the uk  singapore  and china 
we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and is effective beginning after december  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
this standard is effective beginning after december  we presently do not anticipate that we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  which establishes principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
we are required to apply this standard prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  earlier application is not permitted 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allocation of revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement is based on fair value of the element being sold on a stand alone basis 
we generally do not provide upgrades or other post contract customer support pcs on the software embedded in our products 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is million as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is million at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million 

table of contents valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria of fin no 
 under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carryback benefit in from the third quarter of through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in  and our ongoing assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets in  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carryforwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that the deferred tax assets reflected on our balance sheet at december  were realizable  and properly reflect the anticipated benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from deductible temporary differences 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of our management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities  various tax exempt securities or certain approved corporate instruments with effective maturities of five years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
the policy also provides for investment in certain specified marketable equity securities 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of years 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease the market value of our marketable securities by approximately million 
if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that day 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   the losses from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements and the transaction gain on the underlying inter company balance were not significant 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize such risk by limiting our counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
