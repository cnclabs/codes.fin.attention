critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the net realizable value of inventories and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payment for products and services 
the company evaluates the collectability of customer receivables by considering the payment history and the financial stability of its customers 
if the company believes that an account receivable may not be collected  a charge is recorded 
the company maintains trade accounts receivable in both continuing and discontinued operations 
at september  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trades accounts receivable from continuing operations was and  respectively 
reserve for obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
the company generally considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply based on current year activity as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
the company also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were and  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
goodwill the company evaluates the fair value and recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in determining fair value and recoverability  the company makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for the terminals business segment  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
currently  the company has significant deferred tax assets principally related to net operating losses 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and when necessary  valuation allowances are based on historical tax losses  projected future taxable income  and expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances have been provided for all deferred tax assets  due to uncertainty in the realizability of such deferred tax assets 
future profitable operations and changes in the company s expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances  which would significantly impact the company s net income
