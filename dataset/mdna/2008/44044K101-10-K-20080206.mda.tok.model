executive overview year year year ended ended ended december  december  december  in thousands operating revenue operating expense operating income operating ratio revenue containers units operating revenue increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this revenue growth is primarily attributable to unit revenue improvements resulting from favorable changes in cargo mix  general rate increases  revenue related to acquisitions  increased bunker fuel and intermodal fuel surcharges to help offset increases in fuel costs  as well as increased slot charter revenue 
this revenue increase is offset partially by lower container volumes shipped 
operating expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher vessel operating costs due to the deployment of the new vessels and an increase in the cost of fuel  partially offset by a decrease in variable operating costs due to lower volumes 
operating revenue increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this revenue growth is primarily attributable to rate improvements resulting from favorable changes in cargo mix  general rate increases  increased bunker fuel and intermodal fuel surcharges to help offset increases in fuel costs  and revenue increases from non transportation and other revenue services 
this revenue increase is offset partially by lower container volumes primarily attributable to soft market conditions in puerto rico 
operating expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increases in vessel fuel expense and rail and truck transportation costs as a result of increases in fuel prices  offset by a decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses and other variable operating expenses 
the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower stock based compensation charges  the elimination of the castle harlan management fee  and a decrease in variable operating costs as a result of lower revenue container volumes shipped 
general we believe that we are the nation s leading jones act container shipping and integrated logistics company  accounting for approximately of total us marine container shipments from the continental us to alaska  puerto rico and hawaii  constituting the three non contiguous jones act markets  and to guam and micronesia 
under the jones act  all vessels transporting cargo between 
table of contents us ports must  subject to limited exceptions  be built in the us  registered under the us flag  manned by predominantly us crews  and owned and operated by us organized companies that are controlled and owned by us citizens 
we own or lease vessels  of which are fully qualified jones act vessels  and approximately  cargo containers 
we also provide comprehensive shipping and logistics services in our markets 
we have long term access to terminal facilities in each of our ports  operating our terminals in alaska  hawaii  and puerto rico and contracting for terminal services in the six ports in the continental us and in the ports in guam  hong kong  yantian and taiwan 
history and transactions our long operating history dates back to  when sea land pioneered the marine container shipping industry and established our business 
in  we introduced container shipping to the puerto rico market and in we pioneered container shipping in alaska with the first year round scheduled vessel service 
in  we began providing container shipping services between the us west coast and hawaii and guam through our acquisition from an existing carrier of all of its vessels and certain other assets that were already serving that market 
today  as the only jones act vessel operator with an integrated organization serving alaska  puerto rico  and hawaii  we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers that require shipping and logistics services in more than one of these markets 
on february   horizon lines holding which at the time was indirectly majority owned by carlyle horizon partners  lp acquired from csx corporation csx  which was the successor to sea land  of csx lines  llc predecessor a  and of csx lines of puerto rico  inc predecessor puerto rico entity  which together constitute our business today 
this transaction is referred to in this form k as the february  purchase transaction 
csx lines  llc is now known as horizon lines  llc and csx lines of puerto rico  inc is now known as horizon lines of puerto rico  inc horizon lines  inc the company  and together with its subsidiaries  we operates as a holding company for horizon lines  llc hl  a delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary  horizon logistics  llc horizon logistics  a delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary  and horizon lines of puerto rico  inc hlpr  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary 
the company was formed as an acquisition vehicle to acquire  on july   the equity interest in horizon lines holding corp  a delaware corporation hlhc or horizon lines holding 
the foregoing acquisition and related financing and other transactions  referred to in this form k collectively as the acquisition related transactions or merger  included a merger whereby horizon lines holding became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
basis of presentation the company was formed in connection with the acquisition related transactions  and has no independent operations 
consequently  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the company as of december   december  and december  and for the years ended december   december  and december  certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
fiscal year we have a or week every sixth or seventh year fiscal year that ends on the sunday before the last friday in december 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  each consisted of weeks 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and in reporting the amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
since many of these estimates and assumptions are based on future events which cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the application of our critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated and adjustments are made when facts or circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
revenue recognition we account for transportation revenue based upon method two under emerging issues task force no 
revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
under this method we record transportation revenue for the cargo when shipped and an expense accrual for the corresponding costs to complete delivery when the cargo first sails from its point of origin 
we believe that this method of revenue recognition does not result in a material difference in reported net income on an annual or quarterly basis as compared to recording transportation revenue between accounting periods based upon the relative transit time within each respective period with expenses recognized as incurred 
we recognize revenue and related costs of sales for our terminal  logistics and other services upon completion of services 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company monitors its collection risk on an ongoing basis through the use of credit reporting agencies 
the company does not require collateral from its trade customers 
in addition  the company maintains an allowance for revenue adjustments consisting of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  when billing errors occur  and when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
casualty claims we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of our exposure related to certain employee injuries workers compensation and compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act  vehicular and vessel collision  accidents and personal injury and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance self retention or deductible applicable to each claim or vessel voyage  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs 
the amounts of self insurance coverage change from time to time 
our current insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on claims ranges from to  our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the anticipated residual exposure for each claim 
in establishing accruals and reserves for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate 
table of contents reserves for potential liability 
changes in the perceived severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves 
goodwill  purchase costs and other identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual undiscounted cash flow impairment tests 
if there is an apparent impairment  a new fair value of the reporting unit would be determined 
if the new fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the majority of the customer contracts and trademarks on the balance sheet as of december  were valued on july   as part of the acquisition related transactions  using the income appraisal methodology 
the income appraisal methodology includes a determination of the present value of future monetary benefits to be derived from the anticipated income  or ownership  of the subject asset 
the value of our customer contracts includes the value expected to be realized from existing contracts as well as from expected renewals of such contracts and is calculated using unweighted and weighted total undiscounted cash flows as part of the income appraisal methodology 
the value of our trademarks and service marks is based on various factors including the strength of the trade or service name in terms of recognition and generation of pricing premiums and enhanced margins 
we amortize customer contracts and trademarks and service marks on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of four to fifteen years 
we evaluate these assets annually for potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
vessel drydocking under us coast guard rules  administered through the american bureau of shipping s alternative compliance program  all vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards to remain in service carrying cargo between us marine terminals 
vessels must undergo regular inspection  monitoring and maintenance  referred to as drydocking  to maintain the required operating certificates 
these drydockings generally occur every two and a half years  or twice every five years 
because drydockings enable the vessel to continue operating in compliance with us coast guard requirements  the costs of these scheduled drydockings are customarily deferred and amortized over a month period beginning with the accounting period following the vessel s release from drydock 
we also take advantage of vessel drydockings to perform normal repair and maintenance procedures on our vessels 
these routine vessel maintenance and repair procedures are expensed as incurred 
in addition  we will occasionally  during a vessel drydocking  replace vessel machinery or equipment and perform procedures that materially enhance capabilities of a vessel 
in these circumstances  the expenditures are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes that may result in tax deductions in the future and deferred tax liabilities represent expense recognized for tax purposes that may result in financial reporting expenses in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards is not likely 
in conjunction with the election of tonnage tax  we revalued our deferred taxes to accurately reflect the rates at which we expect such items to reverse in future periods 

table of contents fin we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 

the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
as such  we are required to make many assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax positions and the likelihood whether such tax positions would be sustained if challenged 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation in conjunction with the initial public offering  we early adopted sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective approach as of september  sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  and employee stock purchase plans 
in applying sfas r  the value of each equity based award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model takes into account volatility in the price of our stock  the risk free interest rate  the estimated life of the equity based award  the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price 
due to the relatively short period of time since our stock became publicly traded  we base our estimates of stock price volatility on the average of i our historical stock price over the period in which it has been publicly traded and ii historical volatility of similar entities commensurate with the expected term of the equity based award  however  this estimate is neither predictive nor indicative of the future performance of our stock 
the estimates utilized in the black scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
property and equipment we capitalize property and equipment as permitted or required by applicable accounting standards  including replacements and improvements when costs incurred for those purposes extend the useful life of the asset 
we charge maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred 
depreciation on capital assets is computed using the straight line method and ranges from to years 
our management makes assumptions regarding future conditions in determining estimated useful lives and potential salvage values 
these assumptions impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in the period and any gain or loss once the asset is disposed 
we evaluate each of our long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted future cash flows relating to those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  the asset is written down to its fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result of sfas there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
the provisions of sfas were to be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  on december   the fasb issued proposed fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the 
table of contents financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for fiscal  the company will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed fsp fas b 
the company is in the process pf determining the financial impact the partial adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position 
the fasb has published for comment a clarification on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion  such as the convertible notes we issued in august fsp apb a 
the proposed fsp would require the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
as a result  the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate  and the liability component would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected in the results of operations 
the proposed change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share 
the proposed effective date of fsp apb a was originally for fiscal years beginning after december  and did not permit early application 
in november  the fasb announced it expects to begin its redeliberations of the guidance in the proposed fsp beginning in january therefore  it is expected that final guidance will not be issued until at least the first quarter of and it is unlikely the proposed effective date for fiscal years beginning after december  will be retained 
the proposed transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented and does not grandfather existing instruments 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of this proposed fsp 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement of certain financial assets and liabilities under an instrument by instrument election 
subsequent measurements for the financial assets and liabilities an entity elects to fair value will be recognized in the results of operations 
sfas also establishes additional disclosure requirements 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is in the process of determining the financial impact the adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  
table of contents current developments on february   the company filed a shelf registration on form s the registration statement  which became effective upon filing with the us securities and exchange commission  registered for resale the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due and the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes that were part of a private placement completed on august  the notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of per annum 
the notes are convertible under certain circumstances into cash up to the principal amount of the notes  and shares of the company s common stock or cash at the option of the company for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of shares of the company s common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  the company entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions which were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of notes 
the cost of the note hedge transactions was approximately million  million net of tax benefits  and the company received proceeds of million related to the sale of the warrants 
the issuance of the convertible senior notes was part of a series of transactions by which the company refinanced its capital structure 
on august   the company entered into a credit agreement providing for a million five year revolving credit facility and a million term loan with various financial lenders the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility obligations are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the terms of the senior credit facility also provide for a million swingline subfacility and a million letter of credit subfacility 
on july   the company launched a cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding senior notes and senior discount notes 
on august   the company completed the cash tender offer with of the outstanding principal amount of the notes validly tendered 
the company used proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes and borrowings under the senior credit facility to fund the cash tender offer for the senior notes and the senior discount notes 
on november   the company s board of directors authorized the company to commence a stock repurchase program to buy back up to million worth of its common stock 
the program allowed the company to purchase shares through open market repurchases and privately negotiated transactions at a price of per share or less until the program s expiration on december  the company acquired  shares at a total cost of million under this program during the fourth quarter of the company completed its share repurchase program in the first quarter of  acquiring an additional  shares at a total cost of million 
although the company does not currently intend to repurchase additional shares  the company will continue to evaluate market conditions and may  subject to approval by the company s board of directors  repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of montebello management  llc d b a aero logistics aero logistics  a full service third party logistics provider  for approximately million in cash 
as of december   million is held in escrow pending achievement of earnings targets and has been excluded from the purchase price 
in addition  subsequent to december   the company completed its assessment of the working capital received and released million originally placed into escrow and paid an additional million 
the additional million increased the total purchase to million

table of contents on june   the company completed the purchase of hawaii stevedores  inc hsi for approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 
hsi  which operates as a subsidiary of the company  is a full service provider of stevedoring and marine terminal services in hawaii and has operations in all of the commercial ports on oahu and the island of hawaii 
in  a draft of a technical corrections act proposed redefining the puerto rico trade such that it would not qualify for application of the tonnage tax 
however  the technical corrections act  as passed  did not include any language that will adversely affect our utilization of the tonnage tax regime 
during the first half of  the company modified its trade route between the us west coast and asia and guam commencing with the deployment of newly acquired vessels 
this deployment enabled the company to redeploy jones act qualified active vessels to other jones act routes and to commence a new us west coast to hawaii trade route with two of the vessels previously deployed in the guam trade route 
shipping rates we publish tariffs with fixed rates for all three of our jones act trade routes 
these rates are subject to regulation by the surface transportation board stb 
however  in the case of our puerto rico and alaska trade routes  we primarily ship containers on the basis of confidential negotiated transportation service contracts that are not subject to rate regulation by the stb 
seasonality our container volumes are subject to seasonal trends common in the transportation industry 
financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced loads during the winter months 
volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter  which generally results in higher revenues and improved margins 
results of operations operating revenue overview we derive our revenue primarily from providing comprehensive shipping and logistics services to and from the continental us and alaska  puerto rico  hawaii and guam 
we charge our customers on a per load basis and price our services based on the length of inland and ocean cargo transportation hauls  type of cargo and other requirements  such as shipment timing and type of container 
in addition  we assess fuel surcharges on a basis consistent with industry practice and at times may incorporate these surcharges into our basic transportation rates 
at times  there is a timing disparity between volatility in our fuel costs and related adjustments to our fuel surcharges or the incorporation of adjusted fuel surcharges into our base transportation rates that may result in insufficient recovery of our fuel costs during sharp hikes in the price of fuel and recoveries in excess of our fuel costs when fuel prices level off or decline 
during  over of our revenues were generated from our shipping and logistics services in markets where the marine trade is subject to the jones act or other us maritime laws 
the balance of our revenue is derived from i vessel loading and unloading services that we provide for vessel operators at our terminals  ii agency services that we provide for third party shippers lacking administrative presences in our markets  iii vessel space charter income from third parties in trade lanes not subject to the jones act  iv management of vessels owned by third parties  v warehousing services for third parties  and vi other non transportation services 
as used in this form k  the term revenue containers refers to containers that are transported for a charge  as opposed to empty containers 

table of contents operating expense overview our operating expenses consist primarily of marine operating costs  inland transportation costs  vessel operating costs  land costs and rolling stock rent 
our marine operating costs consist of stevedoring  port charges  wharfage and various other costs to secure vessels at the port and to load and unload containers to and from vessels 
our inland transportation costs consist primarily of the costs to move containers to and from the port via rail  truck or barge 
our vessel operating costs consist primarily of crew payroll costs and benefits  vessel fuel costs  vessel maintenance costs  space charter costs  vessel insurance costs and vessel rent 
we view our vessel fuel costs as subject to potential fluctuation as a result of changes in unit prices in the fuel market 
our land costs consist primarily of maintenance  yard and gate operations  warehousing operations and terminal overhead in the terminals in which we operate 
rolling stock rent consists primarily of rent for street tractors  yard equipment  chassis  gensets and various dry and refrigerated containers

operating revenue increased to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this revenue increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands revenue container volume decrease more favorable cargo mix and general rate increases bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges included in rates to offset rising fuel costs revenue related to acquisitions growth in other non transportation services total operating revenue increase the decreased revenue due to revenue container volume declines is primarily due to overall soft market conditions in puerto rico and decelerating growth in hawaii 
this revenue container volume 
table of contents decrease is offset by higher margin cargo mix in addition to general rate increases 
bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges  which are included in our transportation revenue  accounted for approximately of total revenue in both of the years ended december  and december  we increased our bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges several times throughout and as a result of fluctuations in the cost of fuel for our vessels  in addition to fuel fluctuations passed on to us by our truck  rail  and barge carriers 
fuel surcharges are evaluated regularly as the price of fuel fluctuates  and we may at times incorporate these surcharges into the base transportation rates that we charge 
the increase in non transportation revenue is primarily due to higher space charter revenue resulting from the extension of the scope of services provided in connection with our expanded service between the us west coast and guam and asia  partially offset by lower terminal services revenue 
operating expense 
operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or

marine expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase in marine expenses can be attributed to additional stevedoring costs related to services provided to third parties as a result of the acquisition of hsi  which is offset by decreased expenses due to lower revenue container volumes 
inland expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in inland expense is due to higher inland expenses as a result of the acquisition of aero logistics  offset by lower container volumes

the proposed fsp would require the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
as a result  the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate  and the liability component would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement 
the proposed change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share 
the proposed effective date of fsp apb a is for fiscal years beginning after december  and does not permit early application 
in november  the fasb announced it is expected to begin its redeliberations of the 
table of contents guidance in the proposed fsp beginning in january therefore  it is expected that final guidance will not be issued until at least the first quarter of and it is unlikely the proposed effective date for fiscal years beginning after december  will be retained

the company will seek approval from its shareholders to increase the number of authorized but unissued shares such that the number of shares available for issuance to the financial institutions increases from million to million

 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf no 

the company received proceeds of million related to the sale of the warrants  which has also been classified as equity because they meet all of the equity classification criteria within eitf no 
in accordance with sfas  the notes will have no impact on diluted earnings per share until the price of the company s common stock exceeds the conversion price initially per share because the principal amount of the notes will be settled in cash upon conversion 
prior to conversion  the company will include the effect of the additional shares that may be issued if its common stock price exceeds the conversion price  using the treasury stock method 
also  in accordance with sfas  the warrants sold in connection with the hedge transactions will have no impact on earnings per share until the company s share price exceeds

these instruments consist of fixed price swap agreements 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for its counterparties 
changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded as adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in the statement of operations or in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting  the type of hedge transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge
