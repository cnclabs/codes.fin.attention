overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company leveraging our expertise in small molecule chemistry and drug development to develop therapeutic products in oncology and immune mediated diseases based on novel targets  pathways  and mechanisms 
our pharmaceutical agents are synthetic small molecules designed to target key biochemical pathways in diseased cells 
our late stage product candidate  motexafin gadolinium mgd  formerly xcytrin has completed phase trials in patients with brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer nsclc and is now in two phase trials being conducted by the national cancer institute in patients with primary brain tumors 
we have three other drug candidates with product development programs in late stage pre clinical development  phase and phase trials 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not expect to generate any product revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals and launch one of our products  if at all 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
mgd  is an anti cancer agent with a novel mechanism of action 
mgd is designed to accumulate selectively in cancer cells 
once inside cancer cells  mgd induces apoptosis programmed cell death by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase and disrupting redox dependent pathways 
we believe mgd has the potential to be used for treating many types of cancer either as a stand alone agent or in combination with other treatments such as chemotherapy  targeted therapy or radiation therapy 
mgd is also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging mri and may allow for more precise tumor detection 
in the previously conducted pivotal smart trial  study of neurologic progression with motexafin gadolinium and radiation therapy  investigators found that patients given mgd in addition to whole brain radiation therapy wbrt had a median time to neurologic progession of months  compared to months for patients who received only wbrt p  hazard ratio  a trend in favor of mgd 
in north american patients n  where wbrt was delivered more promptly  the median time to neurologic progression was increased from months for patients treated with wbrt alone compared to months for patients receiving wbrt plus mgd p  hazard ratio 
we subsequently concluded that prompt delivery of radiation therapy  as typically given in the us  is an important factor in treatment effect 
in december  we submitted a new drug application nda to the food and drug administration fda for the use of mgd in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from nsclc 
in december  we announced that the fda determined that our nda was non approvable which will require us  among other things  to conduct additional clinical studies and submit that data before the fda will approve mgd for marketing 
we have also completed a phase clinical trial of mgd plus stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastases 
the results  presented at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology indicated that mgd may improve the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery by providing more accurate magnetic resonance imagining mri treatment planning and better defining the treatment field in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors 
mgd allowed physicians to identify occult brain metastases in of patients that were missed with standard mri contrast agents and were amenable to stereotactic radiosurgery 
based on the results of these two trials  we are planning to conduct another phase pivotal trial for the use of mgd in combination with wbrt and stereotactic radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from nsclc 
currently  mgd is under evaluation in multicenter studies sponsored by the nci  a phase trial in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and a phase trial in children with brain stem gliomas 
the fda has also designated mgd as an orphan drug for the treatment of brain metastases arising from solid tumors 
pci is a histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor that is now in a phase trial in patients with advanced relapsed solid tumors and a phase trial in patients with recurrent lymphomas 
pci targets histone deacetylase hdac enzymes and inhibits their function 
hdac enzymes are required for control of gene expression and inhibition of these enzymes leads to tumor cell cytotoxicity 
to date  clinical trials have demonstrated that pci is well absorbed following oral administration and causes inhibition of the target enzyme 
published laboratory studies done in collaboration with scientists at stanford university have identified a novel biomarker that may optimize clinical testing by improving patient selection 
we are also developing a first in class hdac selective inhibitor which is in preclinical development for the potential treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
pci is an oral small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits an enzyme  known as btk  which is required for early b cells to divide and mature into fully functioning cells 
when b cells are overactive  the immune system produces inflammatory cells and antibodies that begin to attack the body s own tissue  leading to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  lupus and multiple sclerosis 
also  b cell lymphomas and leukemias result from mutations acquired during normal b cell development leading to uncontrolled proliferation and b cell malignancies 
studies have shown that pci may inhibit the proliferation of b cell lymphoma and leukemia cells and in published studies  it has demonstrated a dose dependent ability to inhibit disease development in rheumatoid arthritis animal models 
in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis  oral administration of pci leads to regression of established disease 
we plan to file an ind application with the fda for pci the initial phase trial will be conducted in patients with recurrent b cell lymphoma who will receive the drug orally in a dose escalation design 
we have developed a proprietary molecular probe that we will use as a biomarker to optimize our treatment regimen in our phase trial 
the phase trial is designed to assess safety  pharmacokinetics and efficacy 
pci is a small molecule inhibitor of factor viia 
this drug selectively inhibits factor viia when it is complexed with a protein called tissue factor tf 
in cancer  the factor viia tf complex is found in abundance in pancreatic  gastric  colon and other tumors  and triggers a host of physiologic processes that facilitate tumor angiogenesis  growth and invasion 
the factor viia tf complex is thought to be the cause of the increased propensity to develop thromboses seen in cancer patients 
laboratory studies and animal models indicate that inhibitors of factor viia may block tumor growth and metastases 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application for pci with the fda in july we plan to conduct a phase trial in normal volunteers  designed to assess safety and activity against the target protein 
we believe that pci may be useful for treating the thrombotic complications of cancer and also as an anti cancer agent 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us commercial oncology franchise  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonable assured 
license revenue is typically recognized over the term of the arrangement and milestone revenue is recognized when earned as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestone and the absence of any on going obligation 
license  milestone  contract and grant revenues are not subject to repayment 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenues 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at june   all other investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in the statement of operations 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
to date we have had no declines in fair value that have been identified as other than temporary 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with a number of clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
share based compensation we adopted sfas r  share based payments  effective beginning july  using the modified prospective application transition method 
the modified prospective application transition method requires that companies recognize compensation expense on new share based payment awards and existing share based payment awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost of the portion of awards of which the requisite service had not been rendered that were outstanding as of july  has been expensed as the requisite service was rendered 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of the company s stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as the company does not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst its employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the company s options 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes the framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  on december   the fasb issued proposed fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for the year beginning july   we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed fsp fas b 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and our financial position 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the scope of eitf is limited to nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement 
this issue provides that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is not permitted 
companies should report the effects of applying this issue prospectively for new contracts entered into on or after the effective date of this issue 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and our financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles the gaap hierarchy 
sfas no 
will become effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
results of operations revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our revenue over the last three fiscal years change change grant and contract revenues   revenues in fiscal years and were the result of a federal grant awarded by the national institutes of health nih 
work under this grant was completed in fiscal year research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our research and development r d expenses over the last three fiscal years change change r d expenses    r d expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in personnel costs due to lower headcount  a decrease in share based compensation of  and a reduction in consulting costs of  partially offset by increases of  in drug manufacturing costs and  in outside preclinical costs associated with our hdac  btk and factor viia programs 
r d expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in outside clinical trial costs due to the completion of the smart trial  a decrease of in share based compensation expense  a decrease of  in drug manufacturing costs and a decrease of  in personnel and consulting expenses due to lower average headcount and reduced use of consultants 
these cost decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in preclinical study costs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis 
direct costs by program and indirect costs are as follows related r d expenses years ended june  estimated phase of completion product description development of phase mgd cancer phase unknown hdac inhibitors cancer phase unknown btk inhibitors cancer pre clinical fiscal factor viia inhibitor cancer pre clinical fiscal other total direct costs indirect costs total research and development costs research and development expenses decreased  or for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and were primarily comprised of the following mgd program costs decreased  or  primarily due to a  decrease in personnel costs and a  decrease in outside clinical trials costs due to the completion of the smart and other trials 
hdac program costs increased  or primarily due to an increase in drug costs of  partially offset by a decrease in non clinical study costs of  btk program costs increased  or primarily due to a  increase in pre clinical study costs  a  increase in drug costs and a  increase in personnel costs 
factor viia program costs increased  or primarily due to a  increase in personnel costs  a  increase in drug costs and a  increase in preclinical study costs 
indirect costs decreased  or primarily due to a  decrease in personnel costs and an  decrease in share based compensation costs 
research and development expenses decreased  or  for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   and were primarily comprised of the following mgd program costs decreased  or  primarily due to a  decrease in personnel costs and a decrease of  in third party clinical trial costs due to the completion of the smart trial 
a  decrease in drug costs as we did not manufacture any xcytrin in fiscal hdac  btk and factor viia program costs increased a total of  as we continued the development of compounds acquired from celera genonmics late in fiscal indirect costs decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease in share based compensation expense 
we expect research and development expenses to decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our general and administrative g a expenses over the last three fiscal years 
change change general and administrative expenses    g a expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal the composition of g a expenses were similar in both fiscal years 
g a expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in share based compensation expense  a decrease of  in personnel expenses due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decrease of  in commercialization expenses related to reduced activities associated with the results of the smart trial released in december we expect general and administrative expenses to decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expense for the years ended june   and was  and  respectively 
the amount in fiscal was due to our acquisition  in april  of multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation 
one drug candidate was in a phase clinical trial while the other drug candidates were in pre clinical development 
total consideration paid was  which consisted of  shares of our common stock   of cash and  of transaction costs 
we recorded an expense of  related to the consideration for the acquired drug candidates which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use due to the early stage of development and the significant regulatory requirements remaining 
interest and other  net 
interest and other  net  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decline in interest and other  net in fiscal was primarily due to decreased investment balances 
the increase in interest and other  net in fiscal was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned on the company s investments 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital since inception have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements  and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by used in investing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock  the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in november  we completed a public offering of common stock and sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately  in february  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell  from time to time  equity  debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
we may seek to raise funds through additional public offerings in the future but cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful 
our future contractual obligations at june  are as follows operating lease commitments less than year  years  years  more than years total  amounts reflect the july  amendment of the company s facility lease 
in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation now celera corporation business 
future milestone payments under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as million  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments in the mid to high single digits based on annual sales of any drugs commercialized from these programs 
based upon the current status of our product development plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses as a result of on going and future clinical trials to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the near future 
currently  we are actively seeking partnership collaborations to help fund the development of our product candidates 
we may also be required to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through partnership collaborations or sale of our securities  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following our ability to establish and the scope of any new partnership collaborations  the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by  the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates fiscal year fair value at june  marketable securities   weighted average interest rate
