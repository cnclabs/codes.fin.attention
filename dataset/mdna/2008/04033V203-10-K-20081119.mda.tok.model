customers may generally subscribe to our software products and services for a specified term and or pay for services on a time and materials or milestone basis  depending upon their business requirements 
our revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance fees  and services and other fees 
subscription and maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for hosted on demand software solutions and fees for product updates and support  as well as fees paid by suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network 
services and other revenue consists of fees for implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support  license fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual agreements and other miscellaneous items 
due to the different treatment of our revenue streams under applicable accounting guidance  each type of revenue has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subscription fees for hosted on demand software solutions are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term 
similarly  maintenance fees are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
most of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually to continue receiving product updates and product support 
given the ratable revenue recognition and historically high renewal rates of our subscription and maintenance agreements  this revenue stream has generally been stable over time 
services revenues are driven by a contract  project or statement of work  in which the fees may be fixed for specific services to be provided over time or billed on a time and materials basis 
individual subscription software license sales can be significant greater than million and sales cycles are often lengthy and difficult to predict 
these different revenue streams also carry different gross margins 
revenue from subscription and maintenance fees tends to be higher margin revenue with gross margins typically around to 
subscription and maintenance fees are generally based on software products developed by us  which carry minimal marginal cost to reproduce and sell 
revenue from labor intensive services and other fees tends to be lower margin revenue  with gross margins typically in the to range 
our overall gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue 
for example  a period with a higher mix of license revenue versus services revenue would drive overall gross margin higher and vice versa 
overview of fiscal year our revenues increased to million in the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  subscription and maintenance revenues increased million  or  partially offset by a decrease in services and other revenues of million  or 
subscription revenues were million in the year ended september   as compared to million in the year ended september  this is primarily due to an increase in the organic demand for our subscription software products  including on demand software solutions and fees paid for access to the ariba supplier network  and the acquisition of procuri in december services and other revenues decreased primarily due to declines in managed services revenues and perpetual license revenues in the year ended september  operating expenses increased to million in the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to  an increase in restructuring and integration charge of million primarily related to abandonment of approximately  square feet of leased space in our sunnyvale  california headquarters and severance benefit costs in connection with a workforce reduction initiative associated with the integration of procuri and to better align our expenses with our revenues and to enable us to invest in certain growth initiatives  a decrease in other income softbank of million as a result of the amortization period ending in october  an increase in compensation and benefits expense of million due to an increase in headcount in supporting our transition to an on demand model and our acquisition of procuri in december  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million primarily associated with restricted stock grants in fiscal year  an increase in litigation provision of million in connection with the settlement of a patent infringement matter  and an increase in legal expenses of million associated with patent infringement matters 
in sum  our total net expenses  including cost of revenue and other items  increased to million compared to million in the year ended september   which caused a net loss for the year ended september  of million compared to million in the year ended september  outlook for fiscal year with the increase in our backlog  introduction of new offerings and continued shift in demand toward subscription software sales  we expect continued growth in subscription revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year but at a lower growth rate than in we also expect total revenues to grow in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  at a comparable growth rate than in we plan to monitor expenses in fiscal year we expect that total expenses  excluding expenses for amortization of intangibles  stock based compensation and restructuring and integration  will grow  if at all  at a lower rate than revenues 
accordingly  we anticipate continued improvement in our results from operations  before giving effect to these excluded expenses 
deteriorating worldwide economic conditions may adversely impact our business 
although we believe that our spend management solutions may be even more strategic to customers during adverse economic conditions  because they help companies reduce the costs of their goods and services  a weakening global economy  or decline in confidence in the economy  could  among other things  result in reduced revenues  impairment of financial and non financial assets and reduced cash flows 
we believe that our success for fiscal year will depend largely on our ability to renew our subscription or time based revenues  including on demand software fees  maintenance fees  and fees for certain services  sell bundled solution offerings that include both technology and expert services  and capitalize on new revenue opportunities  such as fees for the ariba supplier network and selling on demand spend management solutions to smaller and mid market customers 
in addition to the impact of global economic conditions  we believe that key risks to our revenues in fiscal year include our ability to renew ratable revenue streams without substantial declines from prior arrangements  including subscription software  software maintenance and subscription services  our ability to generate organic growth  our deferral of services revenues as a result of including software implementation and other services as part of a sale with our subscription software solutions  the market acceptance of spend management solutions as a standalone market category  the overall level of information technology spending  and potential declines in average selling prices 
we believe that key risks to our future operating profitability include our ability to maintain or grow our revenues  our ability to maintain adequate utilization of our services organization  our ability to find new tenants for abandoned space  and the potential adverse impacts resulting from legal proceedings 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

subscription and maintenance subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million  a increase from subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  subscription revenues consist mainly of fees for software access subscription and hosted software services 
subscription revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase in the demand for our subscription software products  the continued growth of ariba supplier network revenues and the acquisition of procuri in december maintenance revenues consist primarily of ariba buyer and ariba sourcing product maintenance fees 
maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  we anticipate that subscription revenues will increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  partially offset by modest declines of maintenance revenues in fiscal year subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million  a increase from subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  subscription revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to growth in overall software bookings  a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription sales and the growth of ariba supplier network revenue 
maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  services and other services and other revenues were million for the year ended september   a decrease from services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  the decrease of million in services and other revenues is primarily attributable to declines in managed services revenues and perpetual license revenues in the year ended september  we anticipate that services and other revenues will decline slightly in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to continuing declines in perpetual license revenues 
services and other revenues were million for the year ended september   a decrease from services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  the decrease of million in services and other revenues is primarily due to a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription sales  a decline in renewals of sourcing services revenues in the year ended september  and a slight increase in the deferral of consulting services revenues in the year ended september  due to such services being bundled with other products or services without evidence of fair value 
cost of revenues subscription and maintenance cost of subscription and maintenance revenues includes hosting services  technical support  training personnel  facilities  equipment costs and stock based compensation costs 
cost of subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  was million  a increase from cost of subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily the result of an increase in hosted support costs associated with the overall increase in subscription revenues in the year ended september  we anticipate that cost of subscription and maintenance expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues in the year ending september  compared to the year ended september  cost of subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  was million  a increase from cost of subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily the result of an increase in hosted support costs associated with the overall increase in subscription revenues in the year ended september  services and other cost of services and other revenues consists of labor costs for consulting services  including stock based compensation costs  training personnel  facilities and equipment costs 
cost of services and other revenues was million for the year ended september   a decrease from cost of services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease of million is primarily due to the following decreased compensation and benefits expense and travel expense of million and million  respectively  due to a slight decrease in average headcount resulting from our re allocation of services personnel to sales efforts in fiscal year in managing our transition to an on demand model 
the decrease in compensation and benefits in the year ended september  is also attributed to an increase in paid time off taken of  resulting in a decrease in compensation expense 
the increase in paid time off taken is attributed to a change in the company s paid time off policy during the year ended september   decreased temporary and contract labor costs of million primarily due to cost cutting efforts initiated in fiscal year  decreased overhead costs of million associated with the slight decrease in average headcount  decreased stock based compensation of million primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants  and  decreased bonus expense of  primarily associated with the slight decrease in headcount noted above and the decision of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company to eliminate bonuses for executives and reduce bonuses for certain key employees 
we anticipate that cost of services and other revenues will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of services and other revenues in the year ending september  compared to the year ended september  cost of services and other revenues was million for the year ended september   a decrease from cost of services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease of million is primarily due to the following decreased compensation and benefits expense and travel expense of million and million  respectively  due to a slight decrease in average headcount resulting from our re allocation of services personnel to sales efforts in fiscal year in managing our transition to an on demand model  decreased overhead costs of million associated with the slight decrease in average headcount  decreased stock based compensation of million primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated and a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants  and decreased temporary and contract labor costs of million primarily due to cost cutting efforts initiated in fiscal year amortization of acquired technology and customer intangible assets amortization of acquired technology and customer intangible assets represents the amortization of assets associated with our fiscal year business combination with procuri and our fiscal year business combinations with softface and freemarkets 
this expense amounted to million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  and primarily relates to our acquisition of procuri and merger with freemarkets 
the decrease in the year ended september  was primarily attributable to assets reaching the end of their estimated useful lives 
we anticipate amortization of acquired technology and customer intangible assets will decrease in the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  due to decreases in costs resulting from our merger with freemarkets as assets reach the end of their estimated useful lives 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the year ended september  was compared to for the year ended september  the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the continued shift in our revenue mix  as the gross margin of software subscription and maintenance revenues is typically much higher than the gross margin of services revenues 
subscription and maintenance revenues contributed of total revenues in the year ended september   as compared to in the year ended september   while services and other revenues contributed of total revenues in the year ended september   respectively as compared to in the year ended september  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is also due to continued operational improvements in consulting services in the year ended september  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the year ended september  was compared to for the year ended september  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to an increase in services and other gross profit as a percentage of services and other revenues and due to the shift in our revenue mix  with subscription and maintenance revenues constituting a higher percentage of revenues and services and other constituting a lower percentage of revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross profit of services and other as a percentage of services and other revenues for the year ended september  was compared to for the year ended september   primarily due to operational improvement in consulting and managed services 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and product marketing personnel and consist primarily of compensation and benefits  commissions and bonuses  stock based compensation costs  promotional and advertising expenses  travel and entertainment expenses related to these personnel and the provision for doubtful accounts 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase of million is primarily due to the following increased compensation and benefits expense and overhead costs of million and million  respectively  associated with a increase in average sales and marketing headcount in supporting our transition to an on demand model and the acquisition of procuri in december included within the increase in compensation and benefits expense noted above is an increase in paid time off taken of  in the year ended september   resulting in a decrease in compensation and benefits expense 
the increase in paid time off taken is attributed to a change in paid in time policy during the year ended september   increased stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to restricted stock grants in the year ended september   increased sales commission expense of million primarily associated with the increase in revenues noted above  and increased provision for bad debt of  associated with a slight deterioration in the aging of accounts receivable in the year ended september  the above amounts were partially offset by decreased bonus expense of million associated with the decision of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company to eliminate bonuses for executives and reduce bonuses for certain key employees within sales and marketing 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues in the year ending september  compared to the year ended september  sales and marketing expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase of million is primarily due to the following increased compensation and benefits expense of million associated with an increase in average sales and marketing headcount in supporting our transition to an on demand model  increased sales commissions of million primarily associated with reversals of sales commission of million in the year ended september   and a million insurance reimbursement in the year ended september  related to litigation expenses which had previously been charged to sales and marketing 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated and a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants 
research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products for which technological feasibility has not been achieved  and quality assurance activities  and primarily include compensation and benefits  stock based compensation costs  consulting costs and the cost of software development tools and equipment 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from research and development expenses of million for the year ended september  the increase of million is primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to restricted stock grants in the year ended september  we anticipate that research and development expenses will slightly decline as a percentage of revenues in the year ending september  compared to the year ended september  research and development expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from research and development expenses of million for the year ended september  the increase of million is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense of million  or  due to an increase in average headcount and a  increase in consulting expense related to the continued development of our on demand solutions in fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated and a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include costs for executive  finance  human resources  information technology  legal and administrative support functions  and primarily include compensation and benefits  stock based compensation costs and professional services costs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase of million is primarily due to the following increased legal expenses of million primarily associated with patent infringement matters  increased stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to restricted stock grants in the year ended september   and increased compensation and benefits and overhead costs of million and  respectively  due to a slight increase in average headcount related to the support of our on demand solutions in fiscal year and the acquisition of procuri in december these amounts were partially offset by a benefit of  related to property taxes on occupied space based on a revised property tax assessment and notice of refund received from the county of santa clara in california in june related to fiscal years through and by a decrease in bonus expense of  associated with the decision of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company to eliminate bonuses for executives and reduce bonuses for certain key employees within general and administrative 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decline as a percentage of revenues in the year ending september  compared to the year ended september  due to reduced legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were million  a increase from general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase of million is primarily due to the following an increase in intellectual property related legal expenses of million associated with legal expenses related to patent infringement matters  and increased overhead and salaries expense of million and million  respectively  associated with an increase in average general and administrative headcount in supporting the transition to an on demand model 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants 
other income softbank during the years ended september   and  we recorded  million and million  respectively  of income from the settlement with softbank entered into in october the million of deferred income recorded upon the settlement with softbank was recognized into income  starting in january  over the remaining term of the three year license that ended in october for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets was   and  in the years ended september   and  respectively 
these amounts consisted of the amortization of trade name trademark and non competition agreement resulting from our merger with freemarkets and our acquisition of procuri 
we anticipate amortization of other intangible assets will remain relatively consistent in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  restructuring and integration costs for the year ended september   we recorded a charge to operations of million 
during the year  we evaluated our office space in sunnyvale  california  and ceased use of approximately  square feet of space in our corporate headquarters and recorded lease abandonment costs of million and leasehold impairments of million 
we also recorded a charge during the year related to severance benefit costs of approximately million in connection with our acquisition of procuri and to better align our expenses with our revenues and to enable our investment in certain growth initiatives 
these amounts were partially offset by a benefit to operations of  primarily related to an agreement with efficient frontier  inc efficient frontier to sublease approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january the remaining benefit in the year ended september  was for property taxes of approximately  related to abandoned facilities in california based on a revised property tax assessment and notice of refund received in june related to fiscal years through for the year ended september   we recorded a net benefit to operations of million 
in june  we entered into an amendment with juniper networks  inc juniper  the successor in interest to netscreen technologies  inc netscreen to the sublease dated as of october  between ariba and netscreen 
pursuant to the amendment  juniper agreed to renew its sublease of approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january in addition  juniper agreed  effective october   to lease approximately  square feet of additional space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january also in june  we revised our estimates for rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates to reflect current market conditions primarily in the northern california real estate market 
the impact of the execution of the sublease agreement with juniper was a benefit to operations of approximately million and the impact of the revised estimated rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates was a charge to operations of million  resulting in a net benefit to operations of million 
for the year ended september   we recorded a charge to operations of million for restructuring and integration costs  which is comprised of the following in june  we revised our estimates for rental rate projections to reflect current market conditions primarily in the northern california real estate market and sublease commencement dates  resulting in a charge of million  severance and related benefits of  resulting from our goal to better align expenses with our revenue levels and to enable us to invest in certain strategic growth initiatives  property taxes of  related to abandoned facilities in california based on a property tax audit assessment related to fiscal years through  and an adjustment to our restructuring obligation of  related to a prior period 
we assessed our findings with respect to the prior period item using the guidance of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 and concluded that the amount of the error was immaterial to fiscal year and the prior period 
litigation provision we recorded a million provision related to the settlement of our patent infringement litigation with sky technologies llc during the year ended september  see litigation general in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended september  was million  a decrease of million from interest and other income  net of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the following a decrease in interest income of million due to an overall decrease in the rate of return on marketable investments and a decrease in average cash and marketable securities balances in fiscal year  and a net realized gain of million associated with the repatriation of cash from ariba korea  ltd 
ariba korea and the substantial liquidation of the entity in the year ended september  interest and other income  net for the year ended september  was million  an increase of million from interest and other income  net of million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily attributable to the following an increase in interest income of million due to an overall increase in the rate of return on marketable investments and an increase in average cash and marketable securities balances in fiscal year  a net realized gain of million associated with the repatriation of cash from ariba korea  ltd 
ariba korea and the substantial liquidation of the entity in the year ended september   an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in the amount of million on accounts receivable billed from ariba  inc in foreign currencies to customers headquartered in foreign countries due to the us dollar weakening against the euro and british pound  and a net realized gain associated with currency translation adjustments of  due to the substantial liquidation of freemarkets sa nv  the former freemarkets entity in belgium  in the year ended september  these amounts were partially offset by a gain of million in the year ended september  related to the settlement of a legal matter assumed in the merger with freemarkets and the release of a tax reserve of  in the year ended september  provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease in the year ended september  is primarily attributable to a recovery of foreign income taxes paid in previous periods in the current year related to a foreign subsidiary 
the increase in the year ended september  is primarily attributable to an increase in withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of cash from ariba korea in the year ended september  as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal  state and foreign tax purposes of approximately billion  million and million  respectively  before consideration of any annual limitations as described below 
the federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year  from fiscal year through fiscal year and from fiscal year through fiscal year  respectively 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations imposed by internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of our federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
as of september   we had research credit carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research credit carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year the state research credit carryforwards will continue indefinitely  except for approximately  which will expire in fiscal year we also had manufacturer s credit carryforwards as of september  for state tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards include net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  generated by freemarkets  which are subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of those losses and credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  long term investments and restricted cash of million 
our working deficit on september  was million 
all significant cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments are held in accounts in the united states 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash of million 
our working capital on september  was million 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars that represent investments in pools of assets  including student loans  commercial paper and credit derivative products 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
contractual maturity dates for these ars investments range from to all of the ars investments are investment grade quality and were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
as of september   we reclassified the entire ars investment balance from marketable securities to long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
typically the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of september  significant estimates used in the dcf models were the credit quality of the instruments  the types of instruments and an illiquidity discount factor 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
the discount factor used for the million of student loan securities and million of commercial paper and credit derivative products was adjusted by basis points bps and bps  respectively  to reflect the then current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation and the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market for these instruments 
based on this assessment of fair value  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  all of which was deemed temporary 
we review our impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
in evaluating the impairment of each ars  we classified such impairment as temporary 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value 
if the issuers of the ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and or the credit ratings of these instruments deteriorate  we may  in the future  conclude that an other than temporary impairment charge is required related to these investments 
such other than temporary impairment may be greater than the million currently accounted for as a temporary decline 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or to record all current and any future unrealized losses as a charge in our statement of operations in future quarters 
we continue to monitor the market for ars transactions and consider their impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
our short term investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
we have decided to modify our current investment strategy by limiting our investments in ars to our current holdings and increasing our investments in more liquid investments 
the decrease in total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash of million in the year ended september  is primarily attributable to cash paid  net of cash acquired  of million related to our acquisition of procuri in the year ended september   partially offset by cash flows from operations of in the year ended september  the decrease in working capital of million in the year ended september  is primarily attributed to cash paid  net of cash acquired  of million related to our acquisition of procuri and the impact to our current liabilities of the increase in current deferred revenues of million in the year ended september  net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash from operating activities of million for the year ended september  cash flows from operating activities increased million primarily due an increase in cash flows from operating activities associated with the management of our accounts payable which resulted in a decrease of million in prepaid expenses and an increase from improved results of operations  excluding non cash charges  partially offset by an increase of million in cash payments for restructuring obligations  primarily associated with severance benefit costs in connection with our acquisition of procuri 
net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash from operating activities of million for the year ended september  cash flows from operating activities decreased million primarily due to a higher net loss excluding non cash charges and a million increase in payments on lease abandonment accruals due to a payment of million associated with surrendering the abandoned space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  partially offset by a decline of million associated with the mountain view  california lease that expired in october net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  the increase of million is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of investments  net of purchases of million 
this was partially offset by cash paid of million as a result of our acquisition of procuri in the year ended september  capital expenditures were relatively consistent in the years ended september  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in purchases of investments  net of sales of million  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of million due to purchases of computer equipment in the year ended september  net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  the repurchase of common stock in both periods represents shares forfeited to ariba by employees in satisfaction of statutory tax withholding obligations incurred as a result of the vesting of restricted shares of common stock held by those employees 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock in both periods are attributed to stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  the repurchase of common stock in both periods represents shares forfeited to ariba by employees in satisfaction of statutory tax withholding obligations incurred as a result of the vesting of restricted shares of common stock held by those employees 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock in both periods are attributed to stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase program 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended september  of million is attributed to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated 
as of september   we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations our primary contractual obligations are under our operating leases and letters of credit  which are discussed below 
in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for  square feet in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced in and ends in january we occupy  square feet in this facility  and currently sublease over two buildings totaling  square feet to third parties 
these subleases expire in january the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
minimum monthly lease payments are million and escalate annually  with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the remaining lease term 
as part of this lease agreement  we are required to issue standby letters of credit backed by cash equivalents  totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal year also  we are required by other lease agreements to hold an additional  of standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for domestic and international real estate leases 
the total cash collateral of million is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we also occupy  square feet of office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease that expires in december this location consists principally of our services organization and administrative activities 
future minimum lease payments and sublease income under noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  lease payments contractual sublease income net obligations thereafter total the above table represents our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the specific timing and actual amounts of payments 
of the total operating lease commitments as of september  noted above  million is for occupied properties and million is for abandoned properties  which are a component of the restructuring obligation 
other than the lease commitments and letters of credit discussed above  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we do not have any material noncancelable purchase commitments as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated limited purpose entities  nor do we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating costs  particularly related to services delivery costs  sales and marketing  research and development and restructuring costs  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating costs will constitute a use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  changes in deferred revenues  our ability to manage infrastructure costs  the outcome of our subleasing activities related to abandoned excess leased facilities and ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource requirements for at least the next twelve months 
should we find it necessary to obtain additional funds  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring obligations related to abandoned operating leases  the fair value of certain marketable securities  contingencies related to the collectibility of accounts receivable and pending litigation and accounting for income taxes 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from two sources i providing software solutions on either a multi tenant or single tenant basis and technical support and product updates  otherwise known as subscription and maintenance  and ii providing services  including implementation services  consulting services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous services 
the significant majority of our standard end user license agreements provide for use of our software under a time based license based on the number of users or other usage criteria 
we license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of some or all of the following i software solutions  either on a standalone or on demand basis  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and unspecified product updates typically over a period of one year or over the term of the license  and iii a services arrangement  on either a fixed fee for access to specific services over time or a time and materials basis 
we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
sales made through resellers are generally recognized at the time that we have received persuasive evidence of an end user customer 
the license agreements for our products generally do not provide for a right of return  and historically product returns have not been significant 
we do not recognize revenue for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancel have expired 
direct sales force commissions are included as sales and marketing expense at the time of sale  when the liability is incurred and is reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the inception of the arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until the fee is collected 
we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value 
our determination of the fair value of each element in a multiple element arrangement accounted for under sop is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is limited to the price when sold separately 
vsoe or other methods of determining fair value that are allowable under eitf are utilized for multiple element arrangements that are not subject to sop revenue from software solutions  hosting and sourcing solutions services is primarily recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  commencing with the initial customer access date 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to software solutions implementation  process improvement  training and other services is recognized as the services are performed or as milestones are achieved or if bundled with a subscription or time based service  or in circumstances where fair value cannot be established for undelivered service elements  is recognized ratably over the term of the access agreement 
certain of our contracts include performance incentive payments based on market volume and or savings generated  as defined in the respective contracts 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized when those thresholds are achieved 
when revenue associated with multiple element arrangements is recognized and one element in that arrangement has fair value  we first allocate revenue on the statement of operations to those elements for which evidence of fair value is available and the residual is allocated to those elements that do not have fair value 
in circumstances where we provide consulting services as part of a multi element arrangement with software solutions  both the software solution revenue and service revenue are recognized under the lesser of proportional performance method based on hours or ratable over the term of the license 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized  and generally results from deferred subscription  maintenance and support  hosting  consulting or training services not yet rendered and recognizable under eitf and license revenue deferred until all requirements of sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements under sab  eitf or sop are satisfied 
deferred revenue excludes contract amounts for which payment has yet to be collected 
likewise  accounts receivable excludes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been deferred 
recoverability of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below the recorded amount of our net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines in the past 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and and no indication of goodwill impairment was noted 
the balance of goodwill is million as of september   and there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
in the years ended september    and  we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease rental projections 
during the year ended september   we revised our estimates for sublease rental rate projections to reflect continued soft market conditions in the northern california real estate market and sublease commencement dates  resulting in a charge of million 
the remaining charge in the year ended september  was related to property taxes of  based on a property tax audit assessment related to fiscal years through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and an adjustment to the company s restructuring obligation related to a prior period 
the cumulative understatement of expenses for periods prior to the year ended september  was approximately  we concluded that the effect of the adjustment was not material to fiscal year and the prior periods 
we recorded the cumulative understatement as an increase in restructuring and integration expense and to total operating expenses during the year ended september  during the year ended september   we also recorded a  decrease to the restructuring obligation due to the assignment of a lease of an excess legacy freemarkets facility 
the reversal of the remaining obligation related to this facility was recorded as a decrease to goodwill 
during the year ended september   we recorded a net benefit to operations of million 
in june  we entered into an amendment with juniper  the successor in interest to netscreen to the sublease dated as of october  between ariba and netscreen 
pursuant to the amendment  juniper agreed to renew its sublease of approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january in addition  juniper agreed  effective october   to lease approximately  square feet of additional space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january also in june  we revised our estimates for rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates to reflect current market conditions primarily in the northern california real estate market 
the impact of the execution of the sublease agreement with juniper was a benefit to operations of approximately million and the impact of the revised estimated rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates was a charge to operations of million  resulting in a net benefit to operations of million in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we recorded a charge to operations of million 
during the year  we evaluated our space in sunnyvale  california headquarters  and ceased use of approximately  square feet and recorded lease abandonment costs of million and leasehold impairments of million 
we also recorded a charge in the year ended september  related to severance benefit costs of approximately million in connection with our acquisition of procuri and to better align our expenses with our revenues and to enable our investment in certain growth initiatives 
these amounts were partially offset by a benefit to operations of  primarily related to an agreement with efficient frontier to sublease approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january the remaining benefit during the year was for property taxes of approximately  related to abandoned facilities in california based on a revised property tax assessment and notice of refund received in june related to fiscal years through lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sublessees and sublease rates using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
we review these estimates each quarterly reporting period  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
see notes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our lease abandonment accrual is net of million of estimated sublease income 
actual sublease payments due under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september  and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s estimate of amounts to be received under future subleases 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters by approximately million as of september  fair value of marketable securities we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars that represent investments in pools of assets  including student loans  commercial paper and credit derivative products 
as of september   we held million of student loan securities that failed to settle in auctions commencing february and million of commercial paper and credit derivative products that failed to settle in auctions commencing august these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
contractual maturity dates for these ars investments range from to all of the ars investments are investment grade quality and were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
as of september   we have classified the entire ars investment balance as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet because of our current inability to predict that these investments will be available for settlement within the next twelve months 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market instruments 
typically  the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on its ars investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of september  significant estimates used in the dcf models were the credit quality of the instruments  the types of instruments and an illiquidity discount factor 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
the discount factor used for the million of student loan securities and million of commercial paper and credit derivative products was adjusted by basis points bps and bps  respectively  to reflect the then current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation and the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market for these instruments 
based on this assessment of fair value  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  all of which was deemed temporary 
the company reviews its impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
in evaluating the impairment of each ars  the company classified such impairment as temporary 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value to par 
if the issuers of the ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and or the credit ratings of these instruments deteriorate  the company may  in the near future  conclude that an other than temporary impairment charge is required related to these investments 
such other than temporary impairment may be greater than the million currently accounted for as a temporary decline 
legal contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions 
see legal proceedings 
we accrue for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have properly accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred 
taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
on october   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for the remaining customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding  the current business environment and historical experience 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
new accounting pronouncements for information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products primarily in the united states and india and market our products primarily in the united states  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results have been and could in the future be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our non us sales are priced in currencies other than the non us dollar  a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues 
if any of the events described above were to continue to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a large portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to earnings 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands buy sell contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency usd foreign currency euro sell   swiss franc buy   czech koruna buy  singapore dollar buy  total the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains or losses of approximately  in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses or gains on the underlying net monetary exposures 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value 
all investments in the table below are carried at market value  which approximates cost
