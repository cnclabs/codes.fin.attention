table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
we consider the allowance for loan loss a critical accounting policy subject to estimate 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  see analysis of the allowance for loan losses in this management s discussion and analysis and allowance for loan losses in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is one of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect financial condition and results of operations 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change  relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes  and the valuation of stock options and valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans 
in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale  management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties

in addition  we obtained approximately million of securities from the merger with bank of salem 
during the second quarter of  we decided to withdraw our earlier decision to early adopt sfas and  effective january  however  we proceeded with a balance sheet restructuring in which we sold million of available for sale securities with a net realized pre tax loss of thousand 
the securities chosen to be sold were those with the least attractive yield  cash flow and interest rate risk characteristics 
approximately million of new securities were purchased with an overall yield basis points higher than the securities that were sold 
for the year ended december   securities increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   approximately of the securities matured or were called  however  short term securities were purchased for collateral purposes  resulting in the slight increase

within year years after years total commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other loans total loans years after years fixed rates variable rates allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is the amount which  in the opinion of management  is necessary to absorb loan losses 
management s determination of the level of the provision for loan losses is based on various judgments and assumptions  including general economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  prior loan loss experience  the evaluation of credit risk related to specific credits and market segments and monitoring results from our ongoing internal credit review staff 
management also reviews the growth and terms of loans so that the allowance can be adjusted for probable losses 
the allowance methodology takes into account that the loan loss reserve will change at different points in time based on economic conditions  credit performance  loan mix and collateral values 
management and the board review policies and procedures at least annually  and changes are made to reflect the current operating environment integrated with regulatory requirements 
partly out of these policies has evolved an internal credit risk review process 
during this process the quality grade of loans are reviewed and loans are assigned a dollar value of the loan loss reserve by degree of risk 
this analysis is performed quarterly and reviewed by senior management who makes the determination if the risk is reasonable  and if the reserve is adequate 
this quarterly analysis is then reviewed by the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of loans at december  this compares to million  or at december   and million  or at december  net charge off s as a percentage of average loans was in  in and a net recovery of in

table of contents based on certain characteristics of the portfolio  potential losses can be anticipated for major loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  has been allocated among the major loan categories based primarily on their historical net charge off experience  along with consideration of factors such as quality volume  anticipated economic conditions and other business considerations 
in thousands loan loan loan category category category reserve percent reserve percent reserve percent commercial and agriculture real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other unallocated portion of reserve identified for undisbursed loans and reclassifed as a liability loan loan category category reserve percent reserve percent commercial and agriculture real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other unallocated portion of reserve identified for undisbursed loans and reclassifed as a liability historical net charge offs are not necessarily accurate indicators of future losses since net charge offs vary from period to period due to economic conditions and other factors that cannot be accurately predicted 
thus  an evaluation based on historical loss experience within individual loan categories is only one of many factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the overall allowance 

table of contents nonperforming assets loans delinquent days or more or other nonaccruing  restructured and other real estate owned oreo  on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued as of december are as follows in thousands commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other total nonaccruing loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans total loans at end of period total assets at end of period total nonperforming assets to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets total impaired assets to total assets includes loans held for resale for the years ended december  there are certain amounts of interest collected on nonaccrual loans that is included in income  and amounts that have not been accrued  which are indicated in the following table in thousands additional interest income which would have been recorded during the period under original loan terms interest collected and included in net income for the period commitments for additional funds related to loans above impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when management determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled in the loan agreement 
these loans include all loans in nonaccrual  loans restructured  and other loans that management considers to be at risk 
this assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on nonaccrual or the loan has been restructured 
when a loan with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired  the amount of impairment will be measured by the corporation 
if the current value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan an impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an existing allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents nonaccrual loans it is the bank s practice to discontinue accruing interest on virtually all loans that are delinquent in excess of days regardless of risk of loss  collateral  etc 
some problem loans  which are less than days delinquent  are also placed into nonaccrual status if the success of collecting full principal and interest in a timely manner is in doubt 
some loans will remain in nonaccrual even after improved performance until a consistent timely repayment pattern is exhibited and or timely performance is considered reliable 
at december   there were sixty seven nonaccruing loans  to approximately borrowers  with a combined balance of million 
this compares to eight nonaccruing loans with a combined balance of million at december   and three nonaccruing loans with a combined balance of million at december  one loan totaling million made up of our december  balance 
in the fourth quarter  the million nonaccrual loan was paid in full  including interest of million 
restructured loans in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to the contractual terms  the loan is classified as a restructured accruing loan 
loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time of the contract is modified may be excluded from the impairment assessment and may cease to be considered impaired 
interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement 
interest income on impaired loans is monitored and based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan or the fair market value of the loan s collateral 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is carried at the lesser of book value or market value  less selling costs 
the costs related to completion  repair  maintenance  or other costs of such properties  are generally expensed with any gains or shortfalls from the ultimate sale of oreo being shown as other income or other expense 
at december   we had thousand in oreo 
there was no oreo for the years ended december  and certain other loans  currently in nonaccrual  are in the process of foreclosure and there is a likelihood these foreclosures will be completed and the loans will then become oreo 
this is viewed as an ordinary part of the collection process and efforts are constantly underway to reduce and minimize such nonperforming assets 
deposits interest bearing deposits at december are as follows in thousands money market  sweep and now accounts savings time deposits   and over other time deposits total interest bearing deposits total interest bearing deposits increased million  or  at december   compared to december  time deposits increased million during the same period and represent of total interest bearing deposits at december   compared to at december  of this increase in time deposits  approximately million was attributable to the bank of salem merger 

table of contents total interest bearing deposits increased million  or  at december   compared to december  the movement between types of deposit accounts was characterized by a changing interest rate environment 
investors moved money from traditional savings into our premier treasury account  which is a tiered account  tied to the discount rate for week us treasury bill and offering a higher short term yielding account

the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percent of average earning assets and represents the difference between the yield on earning assets and the composite interest rate paid on all sources of funds 
net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to present income earned on taxable and tax exempt assets on a comparable basis 
reference to net interest income and net interest margin nim  in this discussion  represents taxable equivalent te amounts using a tax rate of  and applies only to loans and investments as no other assets or liabilities are affected by the adjustment

noninterest income loss on sale of securities during the second quarter of  we decided to withdraw our earlier decision to early adopt sfas and  effective january  we  however  proceeded with a balance sheet restructuring in which we sold million of available for sale securities with a net realized pre tax loss of thousand 
the securities chosen to be sold were those with the least attractive yield  cash flow and interest rate risk characteristics 
approximately million of new securities were purchased with an overall yield basis points higher than the securities that were sold 
this compares to a thousand loss on sale of a security in and a thousand loss on a write down of an equity investment in a financial services company in gain on sale of premises and equipment for the year ended december   we recognized thousand from gain on sale of premises and equipment 
this compares to the million gain recognized for the year ended december  in  we sold property which had been held for several years for branch expansion  but was no longer needed 
as a result of this sale  we recognized a nonrecurring pre tax gain of million 
there were no sales of premises and equipment for the year ended december  service charges deposit fee income increased thousand  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  virtually all of the increase was attributable to checking accounts  overdraft fees in particular  which increased million  or  over the same period 
the increase can be attributed to overdraft fee increases effective july  deposit fee income decreased thousand  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year end 
for the same period  noninterest bearing deposits increased million  or 
despite the moderate growth in noninterest bearing deposits  the continued increase in use of debit cards resulted in reduced service fees 
other noninterest income for the year ended december   other noninterest income totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of thousand  or  can be primarily attributed to a thousand increase in trust fees and the thousand accretion of the loan and deposit fair value discounts related to the merger of bank of salem during the fourth quarter see note business combinations in the annual report for further discussion regarding the bank of salem merger 
for the year ended december   other noninterest income decreased thousand  or  compared to the year ended december 
table of contents noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  of this increase  approximately related to staff additions and related to salary and incentive increases  including an additional million related to sfas r stock based compensation expense 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year end 
salaries and employee benefit expense was affected by increases in staff  merit raises and an increase in commissions and bonuses 
the staffing level  referred to as full time equivalent fte  totaled at december   representing a increase over the prior year 
fte s totaled at december   and at december  one issue that complicates the reporting of compensation expense is the deferral of loan origination costs 
in accordance with the current accounting standards  loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
the loan costs  which are determined for each loan type  are then deducted from personnel expense  with the net figures reported in the financial statements 
compensation is thus comprised of the expected items such as salaries  benefits and commissions  but also the effect of deferred loan origination costs  which can vary substantially from year to year 
occupancy expense occupancy expense increased thousand  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year end 
the increase was due to normal rent increases and the opening of new branches in occupancy expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted of increases of thousand in depreciation expense  thousand in office rentals  thousand in software expense and thousand in maintenance agreements 
fhlb prepayment penalty as a result of our second quarter balance sheet restructure  we incurred a pre tax prepayment penalty of million on the prepayment of million of fhlb advances 
the advances chosen to be paid off early were those having the least attractive cost and interest rate risk characteristics 
new advance of million were purchased at a rate basis points lower than the blended rates of the advances that were prepaid 
other noninterest expense other noninterest expense increased million  or  to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in other noninterest expense was primarily attributable to increases in directors fees of thousand  telephone expense of thousand  marketing expense of thousand  postage expense of thousand  consulting fees of thousand and data processing fees of thousand 
other noninterest expense increased million  or  to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase was primarily due to increased marketing expense of thousand  director fees of thousand  communication networks of thousand and amortization expense of intangible assets related to the northstar merger of thousand 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and payment of operating expenses 
the need for liquidity is affected by loan demand  net changes in deposit levels  and the scheduled maturities of borrowings 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices  earnings and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
liquidity is also derived from a variety of funding sources  including advances from the fhlb and other short and long term borrowings 

table of contents the principal use of funds is to invest in loans and securities 
security purchases amounted to million in  up from million in and million in net cash flows provided by loan activities totaled million  million and million  during  and  respectively 
our continued use of cash to fund loan activities reflects the continuing growth of our business 
the increased use of cash for the origination of mortgage loans held for sale totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this corresponds to the increase in cash provided by the proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans with amounted to million in  million in and million in  reflecting the increased volume of business in this area 
for the year ended december   time deposits and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase were our primary funding sources  contributing million in funding 
in  almost all of the funding for our increase in assets came from three sources  million came from increased core deposits  million came from increased time deposits and million came from net fhlb advances 
in  the major funding activities were time deposits which provided million  net fhlb advances which provided million and maturities or calls of securities which provided million in cash flows 
our line of credit with the fhlb has been established at approximately of qualifying loans  which at december   equaled million 
net advances totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
borrowings totaled million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
these borrowings represented of year end assets in  in and in unused lines of credit available to us include million available at fhlb and million available from correspondent banks 
we also have the option of funding asset growth or funding withdrawals with brokered deposits 
at december   brokered deposits were million  representing of total deposits 
for additional information regarding liquidity  see the statement of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
the minimum ratios and the actual capital ratios are set forth in the table below

off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments for the extension of credit  credit card commitments  letter of credit commitments  home equity lines and standby letters of credit 
these instruments are recorded in the financial statements only when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received 
the following table summarizes the amount of commitments as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit credit card arrangements standby and commercial letters of credit commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are written for one year  or have a call in one year 
the fair value of these commitments is not material since they are for a short period of time and subject to customary credit terms 
a fee is charged for all commitments to lend 
there have been no losses associated with these commitments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market pricing and rates 
a significant market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit  borrowing and mortgage banking activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
a number of measures are utilized to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulation and gap analysis further discussed below under the subheading asset and liability management 
an income simulation model is primarily used to assess the impact on earning changes that interest rates may produce 
key assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity  consumer preferences and management s capital leverage plans 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may significantly differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and specific strategies  among other factors 
the model also uses a multiplier effect which is discussed later 
we use a simulation model to estimate the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings and capital 
the model calculates the change in net interest income under various rate shocks 
as of december   the model predicted that net income would increase by approximately million if rates increased and decrease by approximately thousand if rates fell 
the percentages shown in the table below represent changes over a month period in net interest income and net income under two rate scenarios 
the cash flows have been adjusted to account for prepayments and other factors and an assumed tax rate 
in thousands estimated change estimated change estimated change rate shock net interest income net income the interest rate scenarios reflected above represent the results of possible near term interest rate movements 
approximately of the loan portfolio is tied to rate indexes that are one year or less in duration 
these indexes include our base rate  federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb advance rate  wall street journal prime  london interbank offering rate libor and constant maturity treasury cmt 
for the year ended december   our rates moved basis points downward 
at december   the model predicted that our net interest income would decrease by million and our net income would decrease by million  if rates decreased by 
actual net interest income increased million and net income increased million for  compared to the increase in actual net interest income was primarily attributable to increased loan volumes 
for the year ended december   average loans increased million  or  compared to the prior year end 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while structuring the asset and liability components to obtain the maximum net interest margin 
we rely primarily on our asset and liability structure to control interest rate risk 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is the responsibility of the asset liability committee  which acts within policy directives established by the board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to monitor the composition of the balance sheet  to assess projected earnings trends and to formulate strategies consistent with the objectives for liquidity  interest rate risk and capital adequacy 
the objective of asset liability management is to maximize long term shareholder returns by optimizing net interest income within the constraints of credit quality  interest rate risk policies  levels of capital leverage and adequate liquidity 

table of contents assets and liabilities are managed by matching maturities and repricing in a systematic manner 
in addition to a simulation model  an interest rate gap analysis is used to measure the effect interest rate changes have on net interest income 
the gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative in the reverse situation 
however  the exact impact of the gap on future income is uncertain both in timing and amount because interest rates for our assets and liabilities can change rapidly as a result of market conditions and customer behavior patterns 

table of contents expected maturities for financial assets and liabilities in the following table in thousands  the expected maturities for financial liabilities  with no stated maturity  reflect assumptions using the run off rates for noninterest bearing deposits of per year  for now  sweep and money market accounts per year  and for savings accounts per year

our variable rate financial assets may reprice much sooner than their expected maturity date and liabilities may or may not run off at the expected rate as indicated above 
therefore  we prefer to analyze our assets and liabilities as shown in the chart below  which indicates when the assets and liabilities can be repriced

conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  net earnings may increase 
that assumption  however  is based on the premise that assets liabilities within a one year time frame will generally move in the same direction at approximately the same rate 
however  historical data reflects that the relationship between one year asset liabilities may not be as strongly correlated as assumed 
loans with one year repricing characteristics are tied to a number of indexes to include our base rate  the wall street journal prime  the one year constant maturity treasury  libor  and fhlb rates 
those indexes are subject to the movement of the one year market rates 
on the other hand  now and time deposits  which constitute the bulk of the one year repricing liabilities  are subject to the local financial institutions market 
pricing for now and time deposits is dependent on customer preferences and the subjective pricing influence of local banks  credit unions  etc 
thus  while a good portion of our loans are tied to national and international money markets  deposits are subject to the conditions of our market areas in washington and oregon 
additionally  when interest rates change  different rates change by different amounts 
the use of multipliers is used that represent the change of each asset liability rate compared to the change in the federal funds rate 
for example  the prime rate has a factor of indicating it changes the same amount as any federal funds rate change 
core deposit sectors may have a factor of  indicating those rates move only as much 
applying the multipliers to the balance sheet  at december   we had a positive gap of million  compared to a positive gap of million at december
