item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a branded food company specializing in processing  marketing and distributing culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts and snack products 
our company was founded in and has a strong heritage in the in shell and culinary markets under the diamond of california brand 
on july  we converted from an agricultural cooperative association to a delaware corporation and completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
as a public company  our focus is on building stockholder value 
we intend to expand our existing business and to continue introducing higher value  branded products in our culinary and snack businesses  including snack products marketed under our emerald  harmony  and the newly acquired pop secret brand names 
our products are sold in over  retail locations in the united states and in over countries 
we sell products to approximately customers  including over international customers 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly large  national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors to independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we also sell our products to mass merchandisers  club stores  convenience stores and through other retail channels 
our business is seasonal 
consumer demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent  culinary nuts  is highest during the months of september  october  november and december 
we receive our principal raw material  walnuts  during the period from september to november and process it throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last quarter of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at our facilities  which routinely operate at capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
our focus is on expanding sales of products in the north american retail channel  particularly snack and culinary products 
for non retail channels  during the last three years  we have focused on increasing sales of higher value added  higher margin products while reducing sales of lower margin products 
as a result  the volume of sales has declined outside of the north american retail channel and we expect the volume decline to continue 
we periodically assess our walnut supply requirements and sources  including the volume of walnuts to be received under long term contracts or from other sources 
the allocation of walnuts received from the various sources may vary from year to year depending on a variety of factors  including contract renewals  our assessment of future walnut supply and demand  and other factors 
a disproportionate amount of our net sales and related net income are recognized in the first half of our fiscal year 
for example  in both and we recognized of our net sales for the full fiscal year in the first six months of the year 
in the near term  we expect a higher percentage of our net income to be earned in the first half of our fiscal year because many of our operating costs are fixed and cannot be reduced when net sales are lower quarter to quarter 
however  as we continue to introduce new products  such as snack products  we expect net sales and related net income to become less seasonal 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
customers have the right to return certain products 
product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in net sales 

table of contents inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or market basis 
in connection with our july initial public offering  we entered into long term walnut purchase agreements with substantially all of our former member growers 
under these agreements  growers deliver their entire walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season and we determine the purchase price for this inventory by march of the following year 
this purchase price will be a price determined by us in good faith  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality  and nut varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate price to be paid will be determined each march subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  management must make an estimate of this price for the first and second quarter interim financial statements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or more often if there are indications of possible impairment 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
we perform the annual goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of each year 
we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
effective august   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes 
upon adoption  we recorded a non current liability of million and a non current deferred tax asset for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations

off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation is likely to however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices and interest rates on borrowings 
although we have international sales and related trade receivables from foreign customers  we do not have any significant foreign currency exchange risk as substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality  and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds  other nuts and corn are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the exposure to our cash equivalents for changes in interest rates  which are primarily affected by credit quality and the type of cash equivalents we hold 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 

table of contents the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be an increase of pretax income of approximately million or a decrease of pretax income of million  respectively 
interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on the libor
