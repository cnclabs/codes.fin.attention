item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing pharmaceutical products that target unmet medical needs in both niche and broader markets 
we are currently developing puricase  which we refer to as pegloticase  which is being developed for the control of uric acid in patients with gout whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled by conventional urate lowering therapy due to ineffectiveness  dose limiting toxicity  hypersensitivity or other contraindications 
in pegloticase received orphan drug designation by the us food and drug administration  or fda  which may allow it to receive orphan drug exclusivity if and when pegloticase is approved 
orphan drug exclusivity may prevent competitive versions of the same drug for the same indication from entering the market for a period of seven years from the time of fda approval of pegloticase 
in october  we completed the in life portion of our two replicate phase clinical trials of pegloticase and announced positive top line clinical results in december in february  we observed positive results for additional secondary endpoints in our two replicate phase studies 
we are scheduled to have a pre biologics license application  or bla  meeting with the reviewing division of the fda on april  and plan to request a priority review at that time 
we intend to file the bla with the fda as soon as practicable following the pre bla meeting based on the positive results from our phase clinical studies  assuming we are granted a priority review by the fda and they then adhere to the established action date  and expect an fda action date by early we are conducting an open label extension study enrolling patients who completed the phase protocols 
in the extension study  patients may receive open label pegloticase every two weeks  or every four weeks  or participate in an observation only arm of the study 
we are also conducting a small study in patients at four clinical sites that participated in pegloticase early development studies  but who have not had pegloticase treatment since completing the phase or phase study in which they participated 
the patients enrolled in this study will be eligible to receive six months of pegloticase treatment 
in addition  we are conducting two juvenile toxicology studies 
our strategic plan is to advance the development of pegloticase  launch the product in the united states and canada  partner the product outside the united states and canada and expand our product portfolio by in licensing compounds and exploring co promotion and co development opportunities that fit our expertise in specialty pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals with an initial focus in rheumatology 
we currently sell and distribute branded and generic versions of oxandrolone  which are used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we distribute the branded version of oxandrolone in the united states under the name oxandrin and we distribute our 
table of contents authorized generic version of oxandrolone through an agreement with watson pharmaceuticals  inc  or watson 
we launched oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to oxandrin and currently have five competitors in the oxandrolone market 
our generic competitors are sandoz pharmaceuticals  upsher smith laboratories  par pharmaceuticals  roxane laboratories and kali laboratories 
we plan to continue to distribute the oxandrin brand product directly through wholesalers 
the introduction of oxandrin generics has led to decreased demand for oxandrin 
we believe that sales of oxandrin will continue to decrease  and that  in the near term  shipments will decline in order to ensure that product currently at wholesalers and retailers will be sold and pulled through the distribution channel prior to expiration of the product 
our authorized generic  oxandrolone  is currently competing with third party generics  as well as with our oxandrin product 
as a generic product  oxandrolone is yielding lower selling prices than our oxandrin product and therefore its impact is minimal in offsetting the reduction in oxandrin revenues 
in addition  because our oxandrin product and our generic oxandrolone products both face competition from other providers of oxandrin generics  we believe that our partial market share of the oxandrin and oxandrolone market  together with decreasing selling prices  will continue to lead to lower oxandrin and oxandrolone revenues 
we restructured our commercial operations in and such that we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment which includes sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone  and the research and development activities of pegloticase 
as part of the restructuring  we discontinued our nineteen person oxandrin field sales force in january prior to august  we also marketed more than pharmaceutical products in oral liquid form in the united kingdom  europe and parts of asia through our former united kingdom subsidiary  rosemont pharmaceuticals  ltd  which we refer to as rosemont 
we sold rosemont in august to ingleby limited  a close brothers private equity company  for million 
the results of our former rosemont subsidiary are included as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in january  we completed the sale of delatestryl  an injectable testosterone product for male hypogonadism  to indevus pharmaceuticals  inc  or indevus 
under the terms of the sale  indevus paid us an initial payment of million and a portion of net sales of the product for the first three years following the closing of the transaction  based on an escalating scale 
a million gain on the sale of delatestryl was recorded for the year ended december  discontinued operations during august  we sold rosemont our oral liquid pharmaceuticals business in the united kingdom  to ingleby limited  a close brothers private equity company  or close brothers 
under the terms of the sale  close brothers paid to us an aggregate purchase price of million for the issued share capital of rosemont s parent company and certain other related assets 
net proceeds from the transaction after selling costs and taxes were million 
additionally  close brothers purchased certain intellectual property and other assets and rights from us which relate to the business of rosemont  including certain intellectual property related to the soltamox product 
the pre tax gain on disposition of the oral liquid pharmaceuticals business was million 
in july  we sold btg israel  our former biologics manufacturing business  which primarily operated in israel 
financial results related to btg israel are included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  the loss on disposition of the btg israel business was  
table of contents revenue  operating income and income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations discontinued operations during includes tax refunds received by us from the israeli taxing authorities and foreign currency exchange gains on foreign tax refunds 
the refund was due to an overpayment of estimated taxes in israel for the short tax year 
discontinued operations during include the results of rosemont up until its sale in august discontinued operations during include the results from btg israel up until its sale in july of and a full year for rosemont 
we did not have any revenues from discontinued operations in revenues from discontinued operations decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in  as a result of having revenues attributable to both btg israel and rosemont in  and only to rosemont in we did not have any operating income from discontinued operations in operating income from discontinued operations decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in  as a result of having operating income attributable to both btg israel and rosemont in  and only to rosemont in income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  due to israel tax refunds and foreign currency exchange gains on these refunds 
income from discontinued operations increased by million  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of rosemont  net of income taxes  realized in income tax expense related to discontinued operations in was million  primarily related to the gain on sale of rosemont  compared to million of income tax expense related to discontinued operations in  mostly related to operating profit generated by rosemont  and to a lesser extent by btg israel 
these results of discontinued operations are not included in the discussion below under results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies include management estimates that are most critical to our reported financial results product revenue recognition 
product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
during  we began shipping oxandrolone to our distributor and have accounted for this on a consignment basis until the product is sold into the retail market 
we have deferred the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria has been met 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec s  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which we refer to 
table of contents together as sab  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  or sfas no 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
sfas no 
states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to or up to twelve months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg delatestryl in  we determined  based on our review of stability data  that the oxandrin mg dosage form demonstrated stability over a three year shelf life and thus we modified the product s label to indicate a three year expiration date 
product with three year expiration dating was first sold to our customers in may in  we determined  based on our review of stability data  that the oxandrin and oxandrolone mg dosage form demonstrated stability over a four year shelf life and thus we modified the product s label to indicate a four year expiration date 
oxandrolone product with four year expiration dating was first sold to our customers in august oxandrin product with four year expiration dating has not yet been sold to our customers 
on january   we completed our sale of delatestryl to indevus pharmaceuticals  inc we continue to evaluate product returns on sales of delatestryl that occurred prior to the sale date to indevus 

table of contents upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
certain specifics regarding these analyses are as follows actual return rates we track actual returns by product and analyze historical return trends 
we use these historical trends as part of our overall process of estimating future returns 
the level of product manufactured the level of product produced has an impact on the valuation of that product 
for productions that exceed anticipated future demand  a valuation adjustment will be required 
generally  this valuation adjustment occurs as an offset to gross inventory 
currently  we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
level of product in the distribution channel we review wholesaler inventory and third party prescription data to ensure that the level of product in the distribution channel is at a reasonable level 
currently  the level of product in the distribution channel appears reasonable for five year and three year expiration product 
the five year expiration product currently has higher levels of inventory in the distribution channel as compared to historical trends 
estimated shelf life product returns generally occur due to product expiration 
therefore  it is important for us to ensure that product sold into the distribution channel has excess dating that will allow the product to be sold through the distribution channel without nearing its expiration date 
currently we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
we have taken the appropriate measures to enforce this policy  including setting up certain controls with our third party distributor 
in addition  we entered into a distributor service agreement with one of our large wholesalers which limits the level of product at the wholesaler 
the terms of this agreement are consistent with the industry s movement toward a fee for service approach which we believe has resulted in better distribution channel inventory management  higher levels of distribution channel transparency  and more consistent buying and selling patterns 
since a majority of our sales flow through three large wholesalers  we expect that these industry changes will have a direct impact on our future sales to wholesalers  inventory management  product returns and estimation capabilities 
current and projected demand we analyze prescription demand data provided by industry standard third party sources 
this data is used to estimate the level of product in the distribution channel and to determine future sales trends 
product launches and new product introductions for future product launches  we will analyze projected product demand and production levels in order to estimate return and inventory reserve allowances 
new product introductions  including generics  will be monitored for market erosion and adjustments to return estimates will be made accordingly 
we also utilize the guidance provided in sfas no 
and sab in establishing our return estimates 
sfas no 
discusses potential factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including the susceptibility of the product to significant external factors  such as technological obsolescence or changes in demand  relatively long periods in which a particular product may be returned  absence of historical experience with similar types of sales of similar products  or inability to apply such experience because of changing circumstances  for example  changes in the selling enterprise s marketing policies or relationships with its customers  and absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 

table of contents sab provides additional factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including significant increases in or excess levels of inventory in a distribution channel  lack of visibility into or the inability to determine or observe the levels of inventory in a distribution channel and the current level of sales to end users  expected introductions of new products that may result in the technological obsolescence of and larger than expected returns of current products  the significance of a particular distributor to the registrant s or a reporting segment s business  sales and marketing  the newness of a product  the introduction of competitors products with superior technology or greater expected market acceptance  and other factors that affect market demand and changing trends in that demand for the registrant s products 
as a result of oxandrin generic competition that began in december  we analyze the impact on product returns considering the product currently at wholesalers and retailers  and the current demand forecasts 
as a result  we recorded an additional product returns reserve of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   based on revised more favorable demand forecasts for oxandrin  we decreased our reserve for product returns by the million established in december these reserves are subject to revision from time to time based on our current estimates 
the aggregate net product return allowance reserve was million as of december   and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowance for product returns is as follows expense provisions actual deductions related to current related to related to balance year prior related to prior balance at description beginning of period sales period sales current year sales period sales other deductions end of period in thousands allowance for sales returns allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the aggregate net rebate accrual balances were million as of december  and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowances for medicaid and other government rebates is as follows expense provisions actual deductions related to current related to related to balance year prior related to prior balance at description beginning of period sales period sales current year sales period sales other deductions end of period in thousands allowance for rebates 
table of contents inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on actual cost 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
as a result of oxandrin generic competition that began in december  we analyze the impact on inventory reserves considering the oxandrin inventory currently on hand  inclusive of raw materials and finished goods  and the current demand forecasts 
the aggregate net inventory valuation reserve was million as of december  and million as of december  in addition  we had committed to minimum purchase requirements of oxandrin raw material inventory in the future which  based on current demand forecasts  were not expected to be met 
during  we recorded a million liability related to our future minimum purchase commitments of oxandrin raw material inventory as a result of the estimated impact of generic competition 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with our oxandrolone raw material supplier which reduced the future purchase commitment obligation in lieu of a final contract amendment payment of million  a portion of which is related to inventory 
share based compensation 
we grant stock options to employees and as compensation to our directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date the options are granted 
options granted to employees have a term of ten years from the grant date and generally vest ratably over a four year period 
options to board members are granted on a yearly basis and represent compensation for services performed on the board 
options granted to board members vest quarterly over a one year period from the date of grant 
the fair value of each option is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
compensation cost for stock options that has been charged against income including employee stock purchase plan related compensation expenses was approximately million in and million in there were no stock option or employee stock purchase plan compensation expenses in in  there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unamortized stock option compensation  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we also grant restricted stock awards to some of our employees and as compensation to our directors 
restricted stock awards are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense on a straight line basis over the life of the vesting period  which has generally ranged from one to four years in duration daily pro rata vesting is calculated for employees terminated involuntarily without cause 
restricted stock awards to board members are granted on a yearly basis and represent compensation for services performed on the board 
restricted stock awards to board members vest quarterly over a one year period from the date of grant 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards is based on the award s grant date fair value  which is the closing price of our common stock on the date the award is approved  multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
during  we issued  shares of restricted stock at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share amounting to approximately million 
during  approximately million of deferred restricted stock compensation cost was amortized to expense  as compared to million during and million during as of december   approximately  shares remained unvested  and there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock 
during and  we granted restricted stock awards that contain performance or market conditions to senior management personnel that could result in the vesting and issuance of common stock if the performance targets or market conditions are achieved 
restricted stock awards granted that contain performance conditions have the potential to vest over the next one to three years upon the achievement of specific financial performance and strategic objectives related to the achievement of budgeted cash flows from operations  developmental milestones for pegloticase and other manufacturing  commercial operations and business development objectives 
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the date the award is approved multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation cost is recorded as an expense over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s best estimate as to whether the shares awarded are expected to vest 
previously recognized compensation expense is fully reversed if the performance target is not satisfied 

table of contents during the year ended december   we issued to our president and chief executive officer  a restricted stock award that contains a market condition  the vesting of which is contingent upon the price of our common stock achieving a certain pre established stock price target 
compensation cost is based upon the grant date fair value of the shares awarded and charged against income over the derived service period 
compensation cost is charged against income regardless of whether the market condition is ever achieved and is reversed only if the derived service period is not met by the senior executive 
we utilized a monte carlo simulation model to calculate both the grant date fair value and the vesting period of the award 
based on this simulation  the grant date fair value of the award is per share and compensation cost is being charged against income ratably over a two year derived service period 
during  we recorded approximately million of compensation cost as an expense related to restricted stock awards that contain performance or market conditions  compared to million during we did not grant any restricted stock awards that contain performance or market conditions during the year ended december  as of december   approximately  shares of restricted stock with performance or market conditions remain unvested 
restricted stock awards with performance conditions encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through and could result in up to million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or are expected to be attained 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards that contain market conditions which we expect to recognize ratably over the next years 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
during  we incurred non refundable fees of approximately million for the reservation of manufacturing capacity associated with potential future production orders for pegloticase pursuant to agreements with our contract manufacturers 
these capacity reservation fees were expensed as incurred as research and development expenses and may be applied to future potential production orders for pegloticase 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the consolidated balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin  in  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this increase in liability resulted in a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
disclosures about fair values of financial instruments  sfas no 
requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the statement of financial position  for which it is practicable to estimate fair value 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value of financial instruments 
other than temporary impairment losses on investments 
we regularly monitor our available for sale portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary  or ott  decreases in the fair value of investments 
management makes this determination through the consideration of various factors such as management s intent and ability to retain an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
ott impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the investment 
in  we recorded million of realized investment losses due to ott declines in fair value  compared to million in we do not believe we will be able to recover the full cost of these declines 
we did not record any realized investment losses due to ott declines in fair value in 
table of contents results of operations our revenues were derived primarily from oxandrin and oxandrolone in  oxandrin in and oxandrin and delatestryl in our product revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payer reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and amount of expenses relating to manufacturing activities  and the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights 
the following table summarizes net sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands oxandrin oxandrolone delatestryl on december   we launched our authorized generic of oxandrin  which is distributed through watson 
on january   we completed the sale of delatestryl to indevus 
we believe that our product performance will vary from period to period based on the purchasing patterns of our customers  particularly related to wholesaler inventory management trends  and our focus on maintaining or increasing business with our existing products  expanding into new markets  and commercializing additional products 
our financial results have been dependent on sales of oxandrin since its launch in december generic competition for oxandrin began in december and the introduction of generic products has caused a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which has adversely affected us financially and has required us to scale back some of our business activities related to the product 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
during  and  we incurred substantial expenses relating to the clinical development of pegloticase 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses in  as revenues from oxandrin and oxandrolone will remain flat or decrease coupled with continued substantial expenses relating to the development of pegloticase 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales of oxandrin partially offset by revenues from our authorized generic product  oxandrolone  through our distribution agreement with watson 
sales of oxandrin decreased million  or  to million in  from in this decrease was primarily attributable to generic competition to oxandrin  which began in december total prescription volume for oxandrin decreased by in from  and we expect that sales will continue to decline in future periods 
the rate of decline will be dependent on various factors  including the pricing of competing generic products and the number of competing generic products in the marketplace 
revenues from oxandrolone  our oxandrin generic  increased by million  to million in  from million in oxandrolone revenues were nominal in  as we launched this product in december we expect that revenues of oxandrolone will decrease or remain flat in future years  due to generic competition 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of oxandrin in as a result of generic competition 
additionally  the results included increased valuation reserves of million related to oxandrin inventory and a million accrued liability related to our future minimum purchase commitments for oxandrin raw material inventory  both resulting from the estimated impact of generic competition 
during  we entered into an agreement with our oxandrolone raw material supplier to reduce our future inventory purchase commitment obligation in lieu of a final contract amendment payment of million  a portion of which is related to inventory 
as a result of this agreement  we recorded a million adjustment which reduced cost of goods sold in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase is the result of phase clinical trials for pegloticase  which were completely enrolled in march and completed in october additionally  significant development work related to pegloticase manufacturing validation was completed in expenses related to pegloticase clinical trials increased by million from to  and pegloticase manufacturing and process development expenses increased by million from to in addition  we incurred approximately million of non refundable fees for the reservation of manufacturing capacity associated with potential future pegloticase orders pursuant to manufacturing agreements with our primary and secondary contract manufacturers 
from to  we also recognized a million increase in stock based compensation expense including performance based stock awards where performance objectives were either achieved or determined to be achievable  a million increase in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount  and a million increase in legal and consulting expenses related to preparation of our pegloticase bla and patent protection 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in  from million in of the decrease  approximately million results from lower salaries  benefits and other expenses related to our oxandrin sales force that we terminated in january additionally  from to  sarbanes oxley related fees decreased by million  financial consulting fees decreased by million  audit fees decreased by million  and legal fees decreased by million 
partially offsetting these lower costs was a million increase in stock based compensation expense including performance based stock awards where performance objectives were either achieved or determined to be achievable 
investment income investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase primarily resulted from dividend and interest income on higher average cash balances partially offset by the impact of lower effective interest rates during as compared to other income expense other income expense decreased million  to an expense of million in  from income of million in our expense was primarily attributable to million of interest and tax penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits for additionally  our results included a million gain on the sale of delatestryl  a million settlement with the ross 
table of contents products division of abbott laboratories  or ross  related to commission payment overcharges  million of income from the expected receipt of omrix stock from catalyst investments  lp  or catalyst  in connection with our agreement with catalyst  and million related to a settlement of litigation with novo nordisk 
income tax expense provision for income taxes decreased million  to a benefit of million in  from an expense of  in the income tax benefit reflects the tax effects of the carryback of our net operating loss to the tax year to recover income taxes paid  a change in the estimated book to tax differences in our federal income tax return as filed in september along with the impact of research and development tax credits for   and applied against our taxable income which resulted in a refund of taxes paid of million and a decrease in our annual effective tax rate 
we will carry back our federal net operating losses  to the extent allowable  against taxable income and anticipate receiving an additional refund of approximately million during which is reflected in recoverable income taxes on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december  results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in other revenues and a million decrease in product sales 
the million decrease in product sales  to million in  from million  was primarily attributable to lower sales of our former product  delatestryl which we sold to indevus in january   partially offset by an increase in sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
sales of oxandrin increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to price increases instituted during  stronger sales and marketing programs  and a reduction in the level of medicaid rebates due in part to the initiation of medicare part d program and with oxandrin being one of numerous products placed upon greater restriction for reimbursement in florida 
partially offsetting these increases in oxandrin sales was an decrease in total prescription volume in compared to this compares with an overall decline in the involuntary weight loss market of 
sales of delatestryl decreased million in from in january   we completed the sale of delatestryl to indevus  which terminated our sales of this product 
as part of the delatestryl sale agreement  we receive royalty payments on net sales generated by indevus 
on december   we launched our generic oxandrolone product via our distribution partner  watson 
sales of oxandrolone were million for the year ended december  other revenues decreased million  to million in  from million in this decrease was attributable to lower royalties resulting from our sale of the exclusive rights to specified intellectual property in december as part of a litigation settlement 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million in  from million in cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to million of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to oxandrin raw material and finished goods inventory on hand as of december  that was in excess of expected future product demand due to the launch of generics 
the excess inventory levels resulted from generic competition to oxandrin 
additionally  as a result of the generic competition to oxandrin  we recorded a million liability in the fourth quarter of related to future raw material purchase commitments that were not required based on lower demand forecasts for oxandrin and oxandrolone 
partially offsetting the higher cost of goods sold variance from the inventory valuation adjustment and liabilities recorded in was a million inventory valuation adjustment recorded in related to the production of oxandrolone  which was not being marketed at that time 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to clinical development expenses for pegloticase due to the initiation of phase clinical studies in may  and higher manufacturing validation and process development costs related to pegloticase

other liquidity and capital resources the impact of generic competition has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our operations and our cash reserves 
we have reduced or eliminated expenses primarily related to selling and marketing activities for oxandrin  none of which in total will offset the decline in revenues 
we anticipate that the continued development of pegloticase will require substantial capital and will have a negative impact on our financial resources in and beyond 
we believe that our cash resources as of december   together with anticipated revenues and expenses  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for at least the next eighteen months 
however  we may fail to achieve our anticipated liquidity levels as a result of unexpected events or failure to achieve our goals 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly with respect to pegloticase  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  including regulatory approvals for pegloticase  and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop in the future  the quality and timeliness of the performance of our third party suppliers and distributors  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the outcome of pending legal actions and the litigation costs with respect to such actions  the level of sales deterioration as a result of oxandrin generic competition  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  and our ability to in license other products or technology which will require marketing or clinical development resources 
if we are required to seek additional funding for our operations  we might not be able to obtain such additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding might be on unacceptable terms 
we continue to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements in order to provide revenue and funding for research and development expenses

table of contents below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitment obligations other commitments total purchase commitment obligations represent our contractually obligated minimum purchase requirements based on our current manufacturing and supply agreements in place with third parties 
the table does not include potential future purchase commitments for which the amounts and timing of payments cannot be reasonably predicted 
other commitments represent obligations related to potential developmental milestone payments that we believe are probable to occur during the pegloticase research and development process up through and including regulatory submission 
developmental and sales based milestone payments that occur upon or subsequent to regulatory approval have not been included in the table due to the uncertainly of achieving regulatory approval 
in the event that pegloticase receives regulatory approval  the resulting milestone payment obligation would be approximately million 
if we successfully commercialize pegloticase and achieve certain sales levels  sales based milestone payments could reach approximately million 
if we successfully commercialize pegloticase  we will owe specified royalty payments  which have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulatory approval and commercialization of pegloticase 
as a result of our adoption of fin on january   we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or timing of payments for this liability  if any 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents accounting pronouncements adopted in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
it requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements in our financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the provisions of sab no 
must be applied to annual financial statements no later than the first fiscal year ending after november  we adopted sab no 
for the year ended december  our adoption of sab no 
has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the consolidated balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
this increase in liability resulted in a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
sfas changes the requirement for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal our adoption of sfas has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and superseded accounting practice bulletin  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
 which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sfas r requires compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal utilizing the transition guidance set forth in sab  particularly with respect to option valuation model variable inputs 
in addition  sfas r requires estimates of grant forfeitures  while sfas allowed forfeitures to be considered as they occurred 
our adoption and application of sfas r has had a material affect on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued sab no 
which expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in sab no 
and which provides guidance in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas r 
in particular  the staff indicated in sab that it will accept a company s election to use the simplified method  regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates of expected term 
at the time sab was issued  the staff believed that more detailed external information about employee exercise behavior eg  employee exercise patterns by industry and or other categories of companies would  over time  become readily available to companies 
therefore  the staff stated in sab that it would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  the staff understands that such detailed information about employee exercise behavior may not be widely available by december  accordingly  the staff will continue to accept  under certain circumstances  the use of the simplified method beyond december  we have employed the simplified method for all of our share options granted prior to december  
table of contents in december  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
eitf issue no 
defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf issue no 
also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants  as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  since we are not currently party to any collaborative arrangement  eitf issue no 
does not impact our financial statements 
however  in the future we may enter into collaborative arrangements and will apply the provisions as prescribed by eitf issue no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
effective february   delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas we will adopt the provisions of sfas on january  we have determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the task force affirmed as a consensus the tentative conclusion that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the task force reached a final consensus that this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
since we currently are not party to any agreements that contain nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  eitf issue no 
does not impact our financial statements

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value

is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not eliminate any disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we will adopt the provisions of sfas on january  we have determined that the adoption of sfas will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements since we will not elect the fair value option for any of our existing assets or liabilities
