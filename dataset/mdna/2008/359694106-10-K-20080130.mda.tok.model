total company when reviewing the company s financial statements  it s important to understand how certain external factors impact the company 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  especially in the united states and europe  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar the company purchases thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of its cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  the company s financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  supply and demand issues of raw materials also have a significant impact on the company s costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as the hurricanes in the us in  also can have an impact as key raw material producers were shut down for extended periods of time 
management continually monitors areas such as capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect its raw materials 
in the company generated percent of its revenue in the us and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which the company supplies products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the economic activity 
in business components such as specialty construction and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  the company s revenues and costs become higher as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar has the most significant impact as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a significant impact on the company s financial results as the us dollar weakened against all major currencies 
net revenue increased nearly million  or percent  in due to the weakness of the us dollar 
the estimated impact on earnings per share was an increase of as compared to during  the company continued with its strategy that began in to reposition its product lines to focus on more value added solutions for the customers 
disciplined selling price management has been key to successfully implementing this strategy 
as part of this strategy  the company has reduced its sales volume in certain low margin businesses that are based primarily on selling price 
this strategy has been the catalyst for the increases in the gross profit margin from percent in to percent in and to percent in 
table of contents in november  the company divested its automotive business to its former joint venture partner  ems chemie 
with less than twenty percent gross margin and de minimus operating margin  the automotive joint venture was not meeting management s return on invested capital requirements 
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain on sale of million  however due to the structure of the transaction  the after tax effect on net income for was a loss of million 
the financial statements for all periods presented in this report reflect the results of the automotive business  including the loss on the sale  as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
financial highlights for included the following income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased percent from to million 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before accounting change increased percent to per share 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of net revenue were percent as compared to percent in strong cash position allowed for the repayment of  of long term debt  lowering interest expense by more than million in as compared to several reasons for the improved profitability in are discussed below in results of operations  but some of the most significant were the continuation of the product line repositioning strategy  productivity improvements realized from various lean six sigma sm projects  and overall cost reductions throughout the organization 
the results included million million after tax of charges in sg a expenses related to the separation agreement with the company s former chief executive officer 
the lean six sigma sm methodology continues to be a key initiative for the company 
the methodology combines two powerful business improvement models lean  which focuses on the elimination of waste and six sigma  which is a customer driven methodology focused on reducing variation in business processes 
projects and initiatives are run by individuals trained in project management disciplines that enable cross functional teams of associates to make fact based decisions and implement solutions on a companywide basis 
the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november once in every five or six years  the fiscal year is weeks instead of fiscal was a week year 
in reviewing the financial results as compared to  the estimated impact of one less week in resulted in a decrease in net revenue of million or percent and a decrease in net income of approximately million or per share 
outlook the biggest concerns going into relate to the global economy  especially the housing and construction related markets in the us management s expectation is that the economic situation in the us will worsen further before starting to recover in the second half of the year 
from a net revenue perspective  the expectation is that revenue growth will turn positive in the second half of the year as the economy improves 
regarding raw materials  prices increased in the fourth quarter of as energy prices again hit record levels 
several announcements of price increases in the first quarter of have been received  especially for materials used in hot melt adhesives 
the slowing economy in the us may relieve some pressure on the tight supply of certain materials and possibly offset some of the impact from high energy prices 
management is committed to managing selling prices so that increases in raw material costs are duly recovered 
will be the first full year of the new regional realignment 
in  new management organizations were put in place in each region and the full benefits of actions will be realized in the balance sheet is in a strong cash position as of december  with million of cash and cash equivalents and million of 
table of contents total debt 
the company has borrowing capacity to support a significant level of merger and acquisition activity 
management continuously evaluates potential opportunities 
with the new organization in place  the business portfolio streamlined with the divestiture of the automotive business and a strong balance sheet  management is committed to deliver solid financial results in  in spite of the difficult economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill recoverability  long lived assets recoverability  conditional asset retirement obligation assumptions  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pretax 
discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the us portfolios is primarily in us equities 
the company has used an expected return on assets assumption for the us portfolio of percent from this rate was used in calculating the expenses for and for  the company used a rate of percent due to the reallocation of the portfolio assets to include a component of fixed income securities 
the company will also use percent to calculate the us pension expense 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption impacts us net pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the non us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent in the prior three years 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the north america operating segment 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill to the net asset carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
the calculations in confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the net asset carrying values for all reporting units 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance and related cash flows 
the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded the net asset carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange  and tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 conditional asset retirement obligations fin  the company has recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to special handling of asbestos related materials in certain facilities 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company has identified certain facilities for which it has plans or expectations of plans to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos or has plans or expectation of plans to exit a facility 
in addition  the company has determined that all facilities have some level of asbestos that will require abatement action in the future 
once the probability and timeframe of an action are determined  the company applies certain assumptions to determine the related liability and asset 
these assumptions include the use of inflation rates  the use of credit adjusted risk free discount rates and the reliance on third party asbestos abatement specialists to estimate the costs to handle asbestos related materials 
the recorded liability is required to be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and or revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate 
share based compensation the company has granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
the company recognizes compensation 
table of contents expense for all share based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  the company recognizes share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognizes compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
prior to sfas r adoption  the company accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly  only recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards  which had a grant date intrinsic value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the company uses the black scholes model to value its stock option awards 
management believes that future volatility will not materially differ from its historical volatility 
thus  the company uses the historical volatility of the company s common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
the company has recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its sorocaba  brazil facility 
in the eifs litigation involving primarily single family homes  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
the company also has accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively impact the company s results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has 
table of contents considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at december   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information to determine its reportable segments for disclosure purposes 
the conclusion of the assessment was that the reportable segments of the company are the four geographic regions 
therefore  the financial information disclosed in this section is now tailored to the four regions with relevant financial information provided for the business components of each of the operating segments 
certain reclassifications to information  as previously reported  have been made to conform to the new segment structure 
the conclusion of the sfas assessment that the four geographic regions are the company s reportable segments was reached because it clearly reflects the company s internal management and organizational structure 
the vice presidents of each region are held accountable for  and are compensated based upon  the performance of the entire segment for which they are responsible 
the business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the overall segment rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment 
results of individual components of each operating segment are subject to numerous allocations of segment wide costs that may or may not have been focused on that particular component for a particular reporting period 
the costs for these allocated resources are not tracked on a where used basis as financial performance is assessed at the total operating segment level

the volume reductions were primarily due to the product repositioning strategy to focus on more value added solutions for customers 
operating income increased nearly percent in as compared to primarily due to improved gross margins resulting from the product repositioning strategy as well efficiencies gained from lean six sigma sm projects and overall tight cost control 
packaging solutions the packaging solutions component was the only north american component to record volume growth in the volume was up primarily due to increased market share at large  existing customers as well as from new customer applications 
the higher volume contributed to a higher gross margin that  combined with reduced sg a expenses  resulted in an operating income improvement of percent in versus the sg a expenses included a million credit related to a favorable legal settlement

the raw material costs increased at a higher rate than the selling prices  therefore margins decreased  resulting in a percent decline in operating income 
specialty construction the specialty construction component was heavily impacted by the slowdown in the us housing and other construction markets 
major customers in this component are wholesale ceramic tile and flooring distributors selling directly to contractors and also large retail outlets

these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  item a 
risk factors identifies some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company has identified these important factors which could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
additionally  the variety of products sold by the company and the regions where the company does business makes it difficult to determine with certainty the increases or decreases in revenues resulting from changes in the volume of products sold  currency impact  changes in product mix and selling prices 
however  management s best estimates of these changes as well as changes in other factors have been included 
references to volume changes include volume  product mix and delivery charges  combined 
these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k

investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases on related subjects 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates result primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso  brazilian real and chinese renminbi 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately million in net income or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  sustained strong economic growth in north america and china coupled with unplanned supplier production outages have led to strained supply demand situations for several key derivatives such as ethylene and propylene  some of their derivatives  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
in  the company s single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
