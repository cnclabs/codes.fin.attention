critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are generally based on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
snap on considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flow

snap on markets its products and services through the worldwide franchise mobile van channel  company direct sales  and independent distributor and other non franchise channels  including its public internet web site 
snap on also derives revenue from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products 
snap on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools  diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer 
for sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation  revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
as required by sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns 
provisions for customer volume rebates  discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends 
revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement 
snap on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements  including sales of software and software related services 
snap on follows the guidance under statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of sop to non software deliverables containing more than incidental software for software and software related elements  and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in conjunction with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  for hardware and hardware related elements 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products and or services  snap on uses vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and  when necessary  uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements 
snap on limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services 
the amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and or when the services are performed 
in instances where the product and or services are performed over an extended period  as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  which generally ranges from to months 
purchased software and costs incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are capitalized at the time technological feasibility has been attained and the related product is ready for general release 
during  and  the company capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of such costs 
amortization of capitalized software development costs was million in  million in  and million in unamortized capitalized software development costs were million at december   and million at december  financial services revenue in addition to its sales of tools  diagnostics and equipment solutions  snap on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees  ii loans to the franchisees customers  and iii loans to snap on s industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended term payment plan 
these financing programs are offered through soc  a consolidated owned joint venture with cit  and snap on s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries 
financial services revenue consists of soc s sales of originated contracts to cit and service fee income  as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from soc and snap on s wholly owned international finance operations 
the decision to finance through snap on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer 
when assessing customers for potential financing  snap on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition  collateral  debt servicing ability  past payment experience and credit bureau information 
contracts originated by soc and subsequently sold to cit are also subject to the underwriting approval of cit 
financing revenue from soc is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to cit net of various fees  including securitization  warehousing  bad debt and prepayment fees 
soc continues to service these contracts for an estimated market rate servicing fee 
servicing fees are paid to soc by cit and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan  with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination 
financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract  with interest computed on a daily basis 
snap on s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through their financing programs

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 
impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are associated  taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and future earnings  discounted by the company s weighted average cost of capital 
annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year  the evaluation indicated that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment adjustments were required 
should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulators  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  and or changes in technology or markets  some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets 
allowances for doubtful accounts snap on s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances  which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
the evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay 
these factors may include customers financial condition  collateral  debt servicing ability  past payment experience and credit bureau information 
snap on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of snap on s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate 
the company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas 
inventory valuation snap on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess  obsolete or otherwise unmarketable 
inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use 
as part of evaluating work in progress and finished goods  management reviews individual product stock keeping units skus by product category and product life cycle 
cost adjustments for each product category product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience  forecasted sales and promotions  technological obsolescence  inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates  further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 
internal use software in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs that are incurred internally in creating software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established 
warranty accruals snap on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded 
snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience  including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snap on s warranty accrual 
pension benefits the calculation of snap on s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snap on s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements 
snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets  and ii the assumed discount rate 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snap on s domestic pension plan assets by would have increased snap on s domestic pension expense by approximately million 
at year end  snap on s domestic plan assets comprised approximately of snap on s worldwide pension plan assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snap on s pension plans 
the objective of snap on s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans 
the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on long term bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity 
the selection of the weighted average discount rate for snap on s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments 
lowering snap on s domestic discount rate assumption by would have increased snap on s domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively 
at year end  snap on s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately of snap on s worldwide projected benefit obligation 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
that cost  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
upon adoption  the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used are management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  the recorded and pro forma stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements 
outlook snap on expects to continue investing in its growth initiatives aimed at expanding value provided to its traditional customers  penetrating new and adjacent segments  and extending its presence in the emerging markets of asia pacific and eastern europe

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market  credit and economic risks market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
snap on s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
snap on s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
foreign currency risk management snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds 
foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
to manage these exposures  snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures 
snap on s financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on foreign currency risk management 
interest rate risk management snap on s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
through the use of interest rate swaps  snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snap on s assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 
snap on utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
snap on s computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variance co variance technique 
these inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  at december   was million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 
the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snap on  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms 
prior to granting credit  each customer is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  collateral  debt servicing ability  past payment experience  credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation 
loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate 
in addition to its direct credit risk exposure  snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain soc loan originations with recourse provisions against snap on primarily for franchisee van loans 
at december   million of loans originated by soc have a recourse provision to snap on if the loans become more than days past due 
for additional information on soc  refer to the section entitled consolidated joint venture in this management s discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel  natural gas and electricity 
the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company s end products  as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods  all of which may contain various commodities including steel  aluminum and others 
snap on s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 
the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel  which we purchase in competitive  price sensitive markets 
to meet snap on s high quality standards  our steel needs range from specialized alloys  which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers  to commodity types of alloys 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
some of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures  we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice 
additionally  unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 
we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road  the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles 
these factors affect the frequency  type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians  and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians  the prosperity of the technicians and  subsequently  the demand the technicians have for our tools  other products and services  and the value they place on those products and services 
to the extent that gasoline prices increase  consumers may turn to other  non gasoline based  methods of transportation  including more frequent use of public transportation 
a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers  the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products
