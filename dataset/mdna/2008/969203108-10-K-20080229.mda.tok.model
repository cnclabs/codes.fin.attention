item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share amounts or unless otherwise noted the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  included in item of this form k 
overview our business we are an independent international contractor serving the oil  gas and power industries  government entities  and with the november acquisition of integrated services company llc inserv  the refinery and petrochemical industries 
we provide engineering  construction  engineering  procurement and construction epc  and specialty services to industry and governmental entities worldwide  specializing in pipelines and associated facilities for onshore and coastal locations 
we provide turnaround services  tank services  heater services  construction services and safety services to the downstream oil and gas markets  primarily refineries 
we also manufacture specialty items for refinery and petrochemical process units 
we provide  from time to time  asset development and participate in ownership and operations as an extension of our portfolio of industry services 
we place particular emphasis on achieving the best risk adjusted returns 
depending upon market conditions  we may work in developing countries and we believe our experience gives us a competitive advantage in frontier areas where experience in dealing with project logistics is an important consideration for project award and execution 
we also believe our engineering  and planning and project management expertise  as it relates to optimizing the structure and execution of a project  provides us competitive advantage in all the markets we address 
in particular  we are a leading service provider to the hydrocarbon pipeline market  having performed work in countries and constructed over  kilometers of pipelines in our history  which we believe positions us in the top tier of pipeline contractors in the world 
we complement our pipeline construction expertise with our service offering to the downstream market providing integrated solutions for turnaround  maintenance and capital projects for the hydrocarbon processing and petrochemical industries 
we have performed these downstream services for of refineries in the united states 
together these business lines allow us to offer a wide range of services to our customers  including engineering  project management  construction services and specialty services  such as operations and maintenance  each of which we offer discretely or in combination as a fully integrated offering  which we refer to as epc 
our segments as a result of our acquisition of inserv in november  we expanded our service offering to include the refinery and petrochemical markets 
the business was reorganized into three new segments  upstream oil gas o g  downstream o g  and engineering 
we can support our clients needs related to epc projects through any of our segments 
upstream o g we provide our construction expertise including systems  personnel and equipment to construct and replace large diameter cross country pipelines  fabricate engineered structures  process modules and facilities  and construct oil and gas production facilities  pump stations  flow stations  gas compressor stations  gas processing facilities and other related facilities 
we also provide certain specialty services to increase our equipment and personnel utilization 
we currently provide these services in the united states  canada  and oman through our upstream o g segment  and with our international experience can enter or re enter individual country markets if conditions there are attractive to us 
downstream o g we provide turnkey project execution through program management and epc services 
we are one of four major contractors in the united states that provides services for the overhaul of high utilization fluid catalytic cracking units  the primary gasoline producing unit in refineries 
these catalytic cracking units  which operate continuously for long periods of time  are typically overhauled on a three to five year cycle 
we also provide similar turnaround services for other refinery process units  as well as specialty services associated with welding  piping and process heaters 
we provide these services primarily in the united states  but our experience includes international projects and we are exploring opportunities to expand this offering to other attractive risk adjusted locations with our downstream o g segment 
engineering we specialize in providing engineering services  from feasibility studies to detailed design work  to assist clients in conceptualizing  evaluating  designing and managing the construction or expansion of pipelines  compressor stations  pump stations  fuel storage facilities  field gathering facilities and production facilities 
we provide these services primarily in the united states through our engineering segment 
our strategy we work diligently to increase stockholder value by leveraging our competitive strengths to take advantage of the current opportunities in the global energy infrastructure market and position ourselves for sustained long term growth 
core tenets of our strategy are described below 
focus on managing risk 
we have implemented a core set of business conduct  practices and policies which have fundamentally improved our risk profile 
we have implemented our risk management policy by exiting higher risk countries  increasing our activity levels in lower risk countries  diversifying our service offerings and end markets  practicing rigorous financial management and limiting contract execution risk 
risk management is emphasized throughout all levels of the organization and covers all aspects of a project from strategic planning and bidding to contract management and financial reporting 
focus resources in markets with the highest risk adjusted return 
we believe north america currently offers us the highest risk adjusted returns and the majority of our resources are focused on this region 
for we earned percent of our revenue in north america 
however  we continue to seek international opportunities which can provide superior risk adjusted returns and believe our extensive international experience is a competitive advantage 
we believe that markets in north africa and the middle east  where we also have substantial experience  may offer attractive opportunities for us in the future given mid and long term industry trends 
maintain a conservative contract portfolio 
our current contract portfolio is composed of percent cost reimbursable work which provides for a more equitable allocation of risk between us and our customers 
while strong current market conditions have been beneficial in transitioning our backlog away from higher risk  fixed price contracts  we intend to maintain a balanced risk to reward portfolio 
ethical business practices 
we demand that all of our employees and representatives conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards in compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  with honesty and integrity  and in a manner which demonstrates respect for others 
leverage core capabilities and industry reputation into a broader service offering 
we believe the global energy infrastructure market remains capacity constrained and we are focused on new opportunities within this market 
additionally  we believe our core capabilities can be expanded beyond the global energy infrastructure market and we are selectively evaluating these prospects 
in november of  we completed the acquisition of inserv which allowed us to enter the downstream energy infrastructure market 
our potential customers are invoking contract award criteria other than price  such as safety performance  schedule certainty and specialty expertise 
our established platform and track record strongly position us to capitalize on this trend by leveraging our expertise into a broader range of related service offerings 
while we currently provide a number of discrete services to both our core and other end markets  we believe additional opportunities exist to expand our core capabilities through both acquisitions and internal growth initiatives 
we strive to leverage our project management  engineering and construction skills to establish additional service offerings  such as instrumentation and electrical services  turbo machinery services  environmental services and pipeline system integrity services 
we expect this approach to enable us to attract more critical service resources in a tight market for both qualified personnel and critical equipment resources 
establish and maintain financial flexibility 
as we address increasingly larger projects and the complex interaction of multiple projects simultaneously underway  we must possess the financial flexibility to meet material  equipment and personnel needs to support our project commitments 
in  we increased our working capital position  excluding discontinued operations  by  percent to  from  at december  this improved financial position in conjunction with our enhanced credit facility significantly improves our financial flexibility 
we intend to use our credit facility for performance letters of credit  financial letters of credit and cash borrowings 
our continued emphasis is on the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to maximize flexibility and liquidity for the development and growth of our business 
leverage core service expertise into additional full epc contracts 
our core expertise and service offerings allow us to provide our customers with a single source epc solution which creates greater efficiencies to the benefit of both our customers and our company 
in performing integrated epc contracts  we establish ourselves as overall project managers from the earliest stages of project inception and are therefore better able to efficiently determine the design  permitting  procurement and construction sequence for a project in connection with making engineering decisions 
our customers benefit from a more seamless execution  while for us  these contracts often yield higher profit margins on the engineering and construction components of the contract compared to stand alone contracts for similar services 
additionally  this contract structure allows us to deploy our resources more efficiently and capture both the engineering and construction components of these projects 
significant business developments in  we made significant progress in re establishing willbros group  inc as an industry leader 
positive events included we sold our interests in nigeria in february we achieved profitability in our continuing operations  and during the third and fourth quarters of we recorded combined net income of  from these operations 
we believe this is the result of new processes and vision for the company and the steps that are being taken to achieve this vision 
strategic transformation of the company by completing two acquisitions in  midwest and inserv  which significantly expanded our capabilities in canada and gave us an entry into the downstream oil and gas market 
we added new directors who bring industry experience and diversified expertise to lead the organization forward with its new strategic plan 
we have significantly improved our financial position through a public offering of common shares and by delivering improved operational performance 
our improved financial position enabled us to put in place a new  revolving bank credit facility led by calyon new york branch as administrative agent 
the new facility provides for cash borrowings of up to one third of the facility for general corporate purposes and for financial letters of credit as well as performance letters of credit 
we have the option  with the lenders consent  to increase the size of the facility to  within the next two years 
significant project awards during  we were awarded multiple projects valued at approximately  as described below we were awarded an installation contract for the construction of three segments of the midcontinent express pipeline by midcontinent express pipeline llc  a joint venture between kinder morgan energy partners and energy transfer partners etp 
the three segments will traverse oklahoma  texas and louisiana and are comprised of approximately miles of inch pipeline 
the projected start date for the project is third quarter we also executed a contract with southeast supply header  llc sesh  a joint venture between subsidiaries of spectra energy corp and centerpoint energy inc to construct approximately miles of the sesh project  consisting of inch diameter and inch diameter pipeline 
sesh will begin near the perryville hub in northeast louisiana and will interconnect with the gulfstream natural gas system  llc pipeline in mobile county  alabama 
construction of the project began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be completed in the summer of we were awarded a contract for the construction of two sections of natural gas pipeline looping sections west of fort mcmurray for transcanada corporation 
the two continuous segments  which total kilometers of inch diameter pipeline  will include the installation of pre fabricated valve assemblies and horizontal directional drilling of three significant water crossings 
construction of the project began in november  with final project clean up scheduled for the winter work session 
we were also awarded a contract to construct and install the pipeline alley tie in connections for kinder morgan 
also in canada  we were awarded a construction contract by suncor for pipeline and civil works associated with the steepbank extraction plant sep 
sep is a new extraction facility to allow for the mining of a new area of the suncor lease in the fort mcmurray region 
the award includes interconnecting pipelines  ranging from inch to inch diameter  to the new extraction facility 
the project began in july we were awarded an epc contract for a new pump station and the modification of four existing stations to support the expansion of marathon oil company s garyville  louisiana refinery 
construction on this associated pipeline portion of the garyville major expansion began in november  with completion expected in the first quarter of willbros us construction was awarded a contract by trunkline gas company  a unit of southern union company  to construct two pipelines that are part of trunkline s field zone expansion project 
one pipeline  a mile inch diameter pipeline along an existing right of way from the kountze  texas  compressor station to the longville  louisiana  compressor station  gives customers increased access to additional texas supply 
the other pipeline is a mile  inch diameter pipeline that extends from kaplan  louisiana  directly to the henry hub 
willbros us construction was also awarded a large diameter pipeline project for the construction of miles of inch diameter pipeline from farrar to kountze  texas by etp 
this project was nearly complete as of december  also in the united states  willbros engineering was awarded contracts for front end engineering by colonial pipeline and additional capital project engineering activities for bp pipelines north america inc financial summary results and financial position for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share on revenue of  this compares to a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share on revenue of  for the year ended december  revenue for increased  percent to  from  in following are the key components of the increase in revenue commencement of work on new engineering and pipeline construction projects in the united states  and expansion of work relating to maintenance and fabrication contracts in the canadian oil sands 
operating income for increased  percent to  from an operating loss of  in  and operating margin increased percent to percent in from a negative operating margin of percent in the operating income increase is a result of the increase in contract income of  percent from  partially offset by the increase in general and administrative g a expenses of  and  of government fines in other non operating  net expense for increased  percent to  from  in the other non operating  net expense increase was primarily driven by a loss on early extinguishment of debt of  related to the induced conversion of  of our convertible notes 
provision for income taxes for increased  percent to  on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the increase in the provision for income taxes is due to improved operating results in the us and canada  thereby generating more taxable income in as compared to the company incurred income tax expense while having a loss from continuing operations as a result of approximately  of losses incurred in panama  where the company is domiciled  that we were unable to offset against taxable income generated in the us and canada  and thus  received no tax benefit 
working capital at december   excluding discontinued operations  increased  percent to  from  at december  the increase in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of  and contract cost and recognized income not yet billed of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  our debt to equity ratio at december   decreased to from at december   primarily as a result of the conversion of  of aggregate principal of our senior convertible notes and the completion of our public offering in november resulting in  of net capital 
these events are partially offset by the increase of our capital lease obligations of  to  at december  consolidated cash flows provided in  including discontinued operations  increased  percent to  from cash consumed of  in cash used in operating activities in decreased  percent to  from  in cash used in investing activities in increased  percent to  from cash provided of  in cash provided by financing activities in increased  percent to  from  in cash provided by the effect of exchange rates on cash in increased  to  from in other financial measures backlog in our industry  backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
our strategy is not focused solely on backlog additions but  capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project 
backlog consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured 
at december   total backlog from continuing operations increased  percent to  from  at december  backlog for discontinued operations was and  at december  and  respectively 
as important as the overall growth in backlog is the composition of our backlog between fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts comprised percent of backlog at december  versus percent of backlog at december  we expect that approximately  or about percent  of our existing total backlog at december   will be recognized in revenue during we believe the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts 
historically  a substantial amount of our revenue in a given year has not been in our backlog at the beginning of that year 
additionally  due to the short duration of many jobs  revenue associated with jobs performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports 
we generate revenue from numerous sources  including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes  including change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas 
these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured 
the following table shows our backlog by operating segment as of december  and year ended december  amount percent amount percent upstream o g downstream o g  n a n a engineering total  continuing operations discontinued operations total backlog ebitda from continuing operations we use ebitda earnings before net interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing ebitda between accounting periods 
we believe that ebitda is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours 
ebitda from continuing operations for increased   percent to  from in the increase in ebitda is primarily the result of increased contract income of  excluding depreciation partially offset by an increase in g a of  excluding depreciation  government fines of  and loss on early extinguishment of debt of  a reconciliation of ebitda to gaap financial information can be found in item selected financial data of this form k 
discontinued operations in  we announced our intention to sell the txp plant  and our assets and operations in venezuela and nigeria  which led to their classification as discontinued operations discontinued operations 
in  we completed the sale of the txp plant and our assets and operations in venezuela 
furthermore  we sold our nigeria assets and operations on february  to ascot offshore nigeria limited ascot pursuant to a share purchase agreement by and between us and ascot the agreement 
for the year ended december   the loss from discontinued operations was  or per basic share 
this compares to a loss from discontinued operations of  or per basic share for the year ended december  in  the net loss from discontinued operations was comprised primarily of the accrual of a settlement amount of  due to the sec under an agreement in principle  consisting of  for profit disgorgement plus  of pre judgment interest thereon  and results of our nigeria operations for days prior to its sale 
the profit disgorgement was specifically attributable to one of our nigerian projects  and is therefore classified as discontinued operations 
additionally  the results from discontinued operations include a small gain on the sale of our nigeria assets and operations and days of income for services provided under the transition services agreement tsa 
during  discontinued operations provided cash of  from operating activities 
transition services agreement concurrent with the sale of our nigeria assets and nigeria based operations  we entered into a two year tsa with ascot 
under the tsa  we were primarily providing equipment and labor in the form of seconded employees to work under the direction of ascot 
ascot has agreed to reimburse us for the seconded employee transition services costs 
as of december  four employees remain seconded to ascot 
there remain unresolved issues related to the use of our equipment as described below which we are working toward resolving 
through december   total reimbursable costs totaled approximately  we are working with ascot to shift from the transition services provided by us to direct services secured by ascot 
as previously discussed  we have made available certain equipment to ascot for its use 
this equipment was not sold to ascot under the agreement 
due to business and legal conditions in nigeria  we took an impairment charge of  related to this equipment in the fourth quarter of our remaining net book value for this equipment at december  was  this equipment is comprised of construction equipment  rolling stock  and generator sets 
we are working with ascot to resolve the issue of rental equipment  either through cash settlement or though an exchange of equipment 
global settlement agreement gsa on september   we finalized the gsa with ascot 
the significant components of the agreement include a reduction to the purchase price of  in resolution of all working capital adjustments as provided for in the agreement  ascot agreed to provide supplemental backstop letters of credit in the amount of  issued by a non nigerian bank approved by the company  ascot provided specific indemnities related to two ongoing projects that they acquired as part of the agreement  and except as provided in the gsa  ascot and the company waived all of our respective rights and obligations relating to indemnifications provided in the agreement concerning any breach of a covenant or representation or warranty 
by finalizing the gsa with ascot  we have further reduced our risk profile 
the reduction to the purchase price was offset with amounts owed to us by ascot of  under the tsa and  from a note payable 
this resulted in a net payment to ascot of  as a result of ascot providing non nigerian backstop bank letters of credit that we have ready access to  we believe our risk of incurring losses from calls being made on our outstanding letters of credit is minimized 
however  during the transition from us to ascot  their operations in nigeria have continued to be impacted by the same difficulties that led to our exit from nigeria  as well as by additional challenges 
ascot s continued willingness and ability to perform our former projects in west africa are important ingredients to further reducing our risk profile in nigeria and elsewhere in west africa 
as such  it was important to receive additional assurances from ascot related to ongoing projects because of our continuing parent guarantees on those projects 
recently  we received our first notification asserting rights under one of our outstanding parent guarantees 
on february   wwai  the ascot company performing the west african gas pipeline wagp contract  received a letter from west african gas pipeline company limited wapco  the owner of wagp  wherein wapco gave written notice alleging that wwai was in default under the wagp contract  as amended  and giving wwai a brief cure period to remedy the alleged default 
we understand that wwai responded by denying being in breach of its wagp contract obligations  and apparently also advised wapco that wwai requires a further million  without which it will not be able to complete the work which it had previously undertaken to perform 
we understand that  on february   wapco terminated the wagp contract for the alleged continuing non performance of wwai  but simultaneously expressed that wapco was willing to re engage wwai under a new contract to finish some of the remaining wagp contract work  and otherwise provide transition services to facilitate the handover of other unfinished wagp contract work to alternative contractors yet to be identified 
also  on february   we received a letter from wapco reminding us of our parent guarantee on the wagp contract and requesting that we remedy wwai s default under that contract  as amended 
on previous occasions  we have advised wapco that  for a variety of legal  contractual  and other reasons  we did not consider our prior wagp contract parent guarantee to have continued application  and we reiterated that position to wapco in our response to its february  letter 
wapco disputes our position that we are no longer bound by the terms of our prior parent guarantee of the wagp contract and has reserved all its rights in that regard 
we anticipate that this developing dispute with wapco could result in a lengthy arbitration proceeding between wapco and wwai in the london court of international arbitration to determine the validity of the alleged default notice issued by wapco to wwai  including any resulting damage award  in combination with a lawsuit between wapco and us in the english courts under english law to determine the enforceability  in whole or in part  of our parent guarantee  which we expect to be a lengthy process 
we have no intention of returning to nigeria 
if ultimately it is determined by an english court that we are liable  in whole or in part  for damages that wapco may establish against wwai for wwai s alleged non performance of the wagp contract  or if wapco is able to establish liability against us directly under our parent company guarantee  and  in either case  we are unable to enforce our rights under the indemnity agreement entered into with ascot in connection with the wagp contract  we may experience substantial losses 
however  management cannot  at this time  predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation which may ensue in this developing wagp contract dispute  or be certain of the degree to which the indemnity agreement given in our favor by ascot will protect us 
based upon our current knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect that the outcome of the dispute will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the gsa also resolves all working capital adjustment issues between us and ascot 
in resolving the working capital adjustment  we were able to relieve assets and liabilities from our books that we felt would have been components of any working capital adjustment 
the completion of the gsa allows us to recognize a gain on the transaction of it also allows us to move even closer to putting the ascot transaction and our exit from nigeria behind us and focus on better risk adjusted opportunities 
additional financial disclosures on discontinued operations are provided in note discontinuance of operations  asset disposals and transition services agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue a number of factors relating to the company s business affect the recognition of contract revenue 
the company typically structures contracts as unit price  time and material  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
revenue from unit price and time and material contracts is recognized as earned 
the company believes that its operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
revenue for fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
the company does not recognize income on a fixed price contract until the contract is approximately to percent complete  depending upon the nature of the contract 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
the company considers unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which the company has customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
the company recognizes revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than the company s cost related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the consolidated balance sheets 
unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in the future reporting periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreement with customers 
the company considers claims to be amounts the company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed income rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects 
results of operations our contract revenue and contract costs are significantly impacted by the capital budgets of our clients and the timing and location of development projects in the oil  gas and power industries worldwide 
contract revenue and cost vary by country from year to year as the result of a entering and exiting work countries  b the execution of new contract awards  c the completion of contracts  and d the overall level of demand for our services 
our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors  our clients and our work locations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue increased  percent to  from  due to increases across all segments 
a year to year comparison of revenue is as follows year ended december  percent increase change upstream o g downstream o g  n a  engineering total upstream o g revenue increased  percent to  from  in the increase in revenue is primarily a result of increased business activity in the united states of  of which  or approximately percent  was attributable to three major projects that started in along with an increase in facility work of  offset by decreases of  related to projects that completed in or early canada revenue increased  in due to an increase of  for major projects  an increase of  for a pipeline construction project attributable to the midwest acquisition made during the third quarter of and an increase of  for fabrication and field services 
oman revenue increased  in which is primarily attributable to an increase in oilfield construction services 
downstream o g revenue increased  as a result of revenues earned in the day period from november  through december  subsequent to the acquisition of inserv 
engineering revenue increased  percent to  from  in the increase in revenue is a result of increased demand for pipeline and facility engineering services 
the volume and size of projects performed in were significantly greater than in this increased activity level is reflected in the engineering year end headcount of  up percent over year end  while maintaining very high utilization 
operating income segment operating income increased  percent to  from an operating loss of  in a year to year comparison of operating income is as follows year ended december  operating operating percent margin margin increase change upstream o g downstream o g n a n a engineering total this table does not reflect government fines of  in which is included in consolidated operating results 
government fines were characterized as a corporate expense and are not allocated to the reporting segments 
upstream o g operating income increased  percent to  from an operating loss of  in the increase in operating income was a result of previously discussed revenue increases with increasing margins for the segment 
higher margins in the united states were partially offset by lower margins in canada  while margins in oman were consistent with the prior year 
also impacting operating income year over year was an increase for depreciation expense  reflecting additional capital investment in heavy equipment towards the end of and throughout and an increase in g a necessary to support the increased level of business activity for the segment 
downstream o g operating income increased the operating income was a result of days of operating results of inserv subsequent to its acquisition in november these results include a charge of for the amortization of intangibles acquired 
engineering operating income increased  percent to  from  in the increase in operating income was primarily a result of the increased mix of our direct labor versus third party and subcontractor services 
the higher mix of in house labor  improved utilization and higher headcount were characteristics of the strong demand for engineering work and our success in hiring and retaining in house engineers 
non operating items interest  net expense decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease in interest expense is due to reduced interest expense as a result of the conversion of  in aggregate principal amount of the and senior convertible notes  partially offset by increased interest expense associated with capital lease additions of  in interest income increased as a result of cash proceeds received from the sale of our nigeria assets and operations of  and excess proceeds from our public offering completed in november that were not used for our acquisition of inserv 
other  net income decreased  percent to an expense of  from income of in the decrease in other  net is primarily a result of  related to the settlement of a vendor lawsuit that originated in  of registration delay payments associated with the registration rights agreement for the senior convertible notes  of commitment fees related to a potential term loan that was not executed  and an increase in foreign exchange losses of loss on early extinguishment of debt expense of  as a result of inducing conversion of  of aggregate principal of our senior convertible notes in may the loss on early extinguishment consisted of  of cash payments made to the note holders as an inducement to convert  of other transaction costs and the write off of  of debt issuance costs 
provision for income taxes increased  percent to  from  in we recognized  of income tax expense on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  in as compared to income tax expense of  on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the increase in the provision for income taxes is due to improved operating results in the us and canada  thereby generating more taxable income in as compared to the company incurred income tax expense while having a loss from continuing operations as a result of approximately  of losses incurred in panama  where the company is domiciled  that we were unable to offset against taxable income generated in the us and canada  and thus  received no tax benefit 
loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes decreased  percent to  from  in in  the net loss from discontinued operations was comprised primarily of the charge of a settlement amount due to the sec under an agreement in principle of  consisting of  for profit disgorgement plus  of pre judgment interest thereon  and results of our nigeria operations for days prior to its sale 
the profit disgorgement was specifically attributable to one of our nigerian projects  and is therefore classified as discontinued operations 
additionally  the results from discontinued operations include the gain on the sale of our nigeria assets and operations and days of income for services provided under the tsa 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue increased  percent to  from  in primarily as a result of increases in upstream o g 
a year to year comparison of revenue is as follows year ended december  percent increase change upstream o g downstream o g n a n a n a n a engineering total upstream o g revenue increased  percent to  from  in the increase in revenue is a result of increased work in canada and the us the increase in canada revenue of  was largely attributable to  in new major projects  increased fabrication and maintenance revenue of  and our new edmonton modular fabrication facility that opened in the fourth quarter of which generated revenue of approximately  in  compared to in as well as other increases of approximately  additionally  united states revenue increased  due to a higher level of activity with major construction projects  oman revenue increased  due to new pipeline construction contracts and oilfield services contracts and other decreases in revenue of engineering revenue increased  percent to  from  in the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase of  from a single large engineering project in the us and approximately  in new epc projects

higher margins were attained  year over year  in the united states  canada and oman 
also impacting operating income year over year was an increase for depreciation  reflecting additional capital investment in heavy equipment towards the end of  and an increase of g a necessary to support the increased level of business activity for the segment 
engineering operating income increased  percent to  from in the increase in operating income was a result of increased staffing within our engineering group driven by increased demand for our engineering services 
non operating items interest  net expense increased  percent to  in from  in the increase in interest expense was due to additional interest expense related our senior convertible notes of  other  net income decreased percent to  from in the decrease in other  net income was primarily due to a reduction in gains on sale of property  plant and equipment and an increase in foreign exchange loss of these reductions in income were offset by an increase in miscellaneous income of mainly related to our participation as a plaintiff in the settlement of a class action suit
