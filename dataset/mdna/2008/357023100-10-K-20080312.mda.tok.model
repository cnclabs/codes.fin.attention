item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum bodied railcars and coal carrying railcars in north america  based on the number of railcars delivered 
we also refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged  cast and fabricated parts for the railcars we produce  as well as those manufactured by others 
our primary customers are shippers  railroads and financial institutions 
our manufacturing facilities are located in danville  illinois  johnstown  pennsylvania and roanoke  virginia 
all of our manufacturing facilities have the capability to manufacture a variety of types of railcars 
in the twelve months ended december   we delivered  new railcars  compared to our delivery of  new railcars in the twelve months ended december  our total backlog of firm orders for new railcars decreased by approximately  from  railcars as of december  to  railcars as of december  the backlog as of december  represented estimated sales of million  while the 
table of contents backlog as of december  represented estimated sales of million 
approximately of our backlog as of december  consisted of coal carrying railcars 
prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material components of our railcars  and surcharges on steel and railcar components remain at historically high levels 
notwithstanding fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  a significant majority of the contracts covering our current backlog include provisions that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
we were able to pass on increased material costs to our customers with respect to approximately of our railcar deliveries in with respect to the supply of components  while the availability of railcar components improved during  the railcar industry continues to be adversely impacted by shortages of wheels and other components as a result of reorganization and consolidation of domestic suppliers  increased demand for new railcars and railroad maintenance requirements 
currently  we believe that these shortages will not significantly impact our ability to meet our delivery requirements as domestic suppliers have improved their delivery capabilities 
the north american railcar market is highly cyclical and the trends in the railcar industry are closely related to the overall level of economic activity 
we expect railroads and utilities to continue to upgrade their fleets of aging steel bodied coal carrying railcars to lighter and more durable aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars 
despite the decline in our backlog  we believe that the long term outlook for railcar demand is positive  due to increased rail traffic and the replacement of aging railcar fleets 
we also believe that the long term outlook for our business  including the demand for our coal carrying railcars  is positive  based on our long term supply agreements  our expanding product portfolio  our operational efficiency in manufacturing railcars and our international opportunities 
however  us economic conditions may not result in a sustained economic recovery  and our business is subject to these and significant other risks that may cause our current positive outlook to change

risk factors 
in april  we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock 
in connection with the offering  we offered and sold  shares of our common stock and certain selling stockholders offered and sold  shares including  shares following the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from the initial public offering  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering related expenses payable by us  were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering and our available cash to repay our existing indebtedness  redeem all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock  pay amounts due under the rights to additional acquisition consideration  pay amounts due in connection with the termination of certain management services and other agreements with certain of our stockholders and pay related fees and expenses 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in september  we completed a secondary offering of our common stock whereby the selling stockholders  including all of our executive officers and certain of our directors  offered and sold  shares including  shares following the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share 
we did not sell any shares and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
we incurred million of expenses in connection with the secondary offering 
in january  our board of directors announced a share repurchase program of up to million 
these shares were purchased in the open market through the third quarter of the total number of shares purchased was  at an average cost of per share 
in december  we announced that we planned to close our manufacturing facility located in johnstown  pennsylvania 
this action was taken to further our strategy of maintaining our competitive position by optimizing production at our low cost facilities and continuing our focus on cost control 
we had entered into decisional bargaining with the union representing our johnstown employees regarding labor costs at our johnstown facility  but did not reach an agreement with the union that would have allowed us to continue to operate the facility in a cost effective way 
financial statement presentation sales our sales are generated primarily from sales of the railcars that we manufacture 
our sales depend on industry demand for new railcars  which is driven by overall economic conditions and the demand for railcar transportation 
table of contents of various products  such as coal  motor vehicles  steel products  forest products  minerals  cement and agricultural commodities 
our sales are also affected by competitive market pressures that impact the prices for our railcars and by the types of railcars sold 
we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from our customers 
we recognize sales  which we sometimes refer to as deliveries  of new and rebuilt railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk of any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
with respect to sales transactions involving the trading in of used railcars  in accordance with accounting rules  we recognize sales for the entire transaction when the cash consideration received is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration received is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value less a normal profit margin 
sales of used railcars for the years ended december   and  were not material 
the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders may cause our sales and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter  which will result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials such as aluminum and steel  as well as the cost of finished railcar components  such as castings  wheels  truck components and couplers  and other specialty components 
our cost of sales also includes labor  utilities  freight  manufacturing depreciation and other manufacturing overhead costs 
factors that have affected our cost of sales include the recent increases in the cost of steel and aluminum  our plans to close our johnstown  pennsylvania facility and our efforts to reduce the costs of new products that we have recently introduced 
we rely upon third party suppliers for wheels and other components for our railcars 
for the year ended december   due to a shortage of wheels and other railcar components  our deliveries were limited to  railcars  even though we had orders and production capacity to manufacture more railcars 
the limited supply of wheels and other railcar components did not impact our deliveries for the years ended december   and while the availability of railcar components continued to improve during  the railcar industry continues to be adversely impacted by shortages of wheels and other components as a result of reorganization and consolidation of domestic suppliers  increased demand for new railcars and railroad maintenance requirements 
currently  we believe that these shortages will not significantly impact our ability to meet our delivery requirements as domestic suppliers have improved their delivery capabilities 
customer orders may be subject to cancellation  customer requests for delays in railcar deliveries  inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to the railcar industry limitations on the supply of wheels and other railcar components could adversely affect our business because they may limit the number of railcars we can manufacture 
the prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material inputs of our railcars  increased in  and as a result of strong demand  limited availability of production inputs for steel and aluminum  including scrap metal  industry consolidation and import trade barriers 
in addition  the price and availability of other railcar components that are made of steel have been adversely affected by the increased cost and limited availability of steel 
any fluctuations in the price or availability of aluminum or steel  or any other material used in the production of our railcars  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the costs for raw steel and aluminum have increased by approximately and  respectively  during the period from october through december  the availability of scrap metal has been limited by exports of scrap metal to china  and as a result  steel producers have charged scrap metal surcharges in excess of agreed upon prices 
in addition  the price and availability of other railcar components that are made of steel have been adversely affected by the increased cost and limited availability of steel 
during the year ended december   our gross profit was adversely impacted by higher costs of approximately million associated with increased material  labor and other costs related to a contract to manufacture box cars 
for the years ended december  and  we were able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers with respect to and of our railcar deliveries  respectively 

table of contents operating income operating income represents total sales less cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  compensation expense under stock option and restricted share award agreements  curtailment and impairment charges and the provision for the settlement of labor disputes in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales our sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to  million for the year ended december  while railcar deliveries of  were  units below the level 
the decrease in sales revenue and deliveries was due primarily to lower industry volume as well as lower demand for coal cars 
in addition  the competitive environment increased as demand slackened with a negative impact on the price of railcars 
average railcar pricing declined between and the decline in average selling price was partially offset by a shift in product mix 
our coal carrying railcars remain an essential part of our portfolio 
deliveries of our bethgon ii and autoflood iii coal carrying railcars comprised of our total railcar deliveries for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower volume 
in addition  the gross margin was impacted by lower operating leverage due to the change in volume and the lower pricing environment 
favorable product mix and continuous cost reduction efforts partially mitigated the impact of lower production activity and the adverse pricing environment 
for the year ended december   we were able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers with respect to of our railcar deliveries 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of our sales for and for the increase was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of million  a special charge of million for contingency losses related to litigation and a million increase in investment for product development programs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in outside professional services of million 
increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for were also partially offset by decreases in several expense categories that were not significant individually but have helped to minimize the impact of the increases previously described 
curtailment and impairment charges in december we incurred curtailment and impairment charges of million 
these charges include net curtailment losses and special termination and contractual benefit costs of million arising under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as contractual employee termination benefits of million for severance and medical insurance 
these charges also include a non cash impairment of the carrying value of certain assets at our johnstown manufacturing facility of  it is anticipated that payments for employee termination benefits will be made during while pension and postretirement benefits will be funded through plan assets and future company contributions to the pension and postretirement plans 
interest expense income total interest expense for each of the years ended december  and  was million 
for the years ended december  and  interest expense consisted of third party interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  primarily attributable to a higher average cash balance during interest income represents the proceeds of short term investments of 
table of contents our cash balances  which decreased by approximately at december  compared to december  interest rates rose steadily during and into but decreased significantly during the second half of income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   as compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective rate for the year ended december  was slightly higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate due to the addition of a blended state rate and a increase caused by a change in the valuation allowance 
these increases were virtually offset by a decrease in the effective rate caused by the domestic manufacturing deduction 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to a blended state rate less a effect for other permanent differences 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be similar to the effective rates for and excluding the impacts of discrete tax items 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income and net income attributable to common stockholders each were million for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of million from net income and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  for  our basic and diluted net income per share were and  respectively  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
for  our basic and diluted net income per share were and  respectively  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
the reduction in net income for compared to is primarily the result of decreased sales volumes during year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales our sales for the year ended december  were  million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
included in our sales for the year ended december  was million attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue related to a customer contract from a prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily due to our delivery of an additional  railcars in the year ended december   compared to the same period in  representing an increase of in deliveries  and higher pricing 
the increased volume of railcar deliveries reflects increased demand for our coal carrying railcars

included in the december  expense was a provision for the settlement of labor disputes of million 
interest expense income total interest expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the decrease was a result of our initial public offering in april and the related changes in our financing structure which significantly reduced our outstanding debt 
for the year ended december   interest expense consisted of third party interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
for the year ended december   interest expense consisted primarily of the accretion of additional interest on the rights to additional acquisition consideration of million  related party interest of million and third party interest expense of million 
interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income represents the proceeds of short term investments of our cash balances  which increased substantially over the period

basic and diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in by per share attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity for the years ended december  and was cash flows generated from operations 
from the year ended december  to the year ended december   the change in net cash provided by operating activities was a decrease of million 
see cash flows 
on august   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement with lasalle bank national association lasalle and the lenders party thereto collectively  the lenders amending and restating the terms of our revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the revolving credit facility are available to finance our working capital requirements through direct borrowings and the issuance of stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit agreement amends and restates the 
table of contents amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of april   by and among us  lasalle and the lenders party thereto the previous credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility  including i a sub facility for letters of credit in an amount not to exceed million and ii a sub facility for a swing line loan in an amount not to exceed million 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of i million or ii an amount equal to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable plus a percentage of eligible finished inventory plus a percentage of semi finished inventory 
the previous credit agreement provided for a total revolving credit facility of the lesser of i million or ii an amount equal to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable plus a percentage of eligible finished inventory plus a percentage of semi finished inventory with a sub facility for letters of credit totaling million 
the revolving credit agreement has a term ending on may  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable margin of between and depending on revolving loan availability as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and based on revolving loan availability 
the previous credit agreement had a three year term ending on april  and bore interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable margin of between and depending on our ratio of consolidated senior debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the previous credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit agreement has both affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and limitations on debt  liens  dividends  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the revolving credit agreement also provides for customary events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements under the revolving credit agreement 
as of december  and december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we had million and million in outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit sub facility as of december  and december   respectively  and the ability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility as of december  under the revolving credit facility  our subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends and transfer funds to us without restriction 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund organic growth opportunities and cost reduction programs  including new plant and equipment  development of railcars  joint ventures and acquisitions  and these capital requirements could be substantial 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
we are also exploring product diversification initiatives and international and other opportunities 
our long term liquidity needs also depend to a significant extent on our obligations related to our pension and welfare benefit plans 
we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the discount rate used on our pension and postretirement welfare obligations and expected return on pension plan assets 
our management expects that any future obligations under our pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 
as of december   our benefit obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan was million and million  respectively  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect to make contributions relating to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions to our pension plans based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
in august  president bush signed the pension protection act of into law 
included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes  as well as minimum funding levels required by our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act and are expected to be fully funded by this expectation will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plans are fully funded as that term is defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 

table of contents based upon our operating performance  capital requirements and obligations under our pension and welfare benefit plans  we may  from time to time  be required to raise additional funds through additional offerings of our common stock and through long term borrowings 
there can be no assurance that long term debt  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments would be expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands capital leases from long term debt operating leases material and component purchases total material and component purchases consist of non cancelable agreements with suppliers to purchase materials used in the manufacturing process 
purchase commitments for aluminum are made at a fixed price and are typically entered into after a customer places an order for railcars 
the estimated amounts above may vary based on the actual quantities and price 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  we also will have interest payment obligations on any borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also pay consulting fees to one of our directors 
the amount paid for his consulting services was  for each of the years ended december   and the agreement governing this arrangement will expire in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the above table excludes million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties at december  because the timing of the payout of these liabilities cannot be determined 
we are a party to employment agreements with our president and chief executive officer and our vice president  finance  chief financial officer and treasurer as well as other members of our executive management team

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december   and net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities 
our net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current assets and liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our contract receivables  processing of bi weekly payroll and associated taxes  and payment to our suppliers 
our working capital accounts also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of certain events  such as the payment or non payment for our railcars 
as some of our customers accept delivery of new railcars in train set quantities  consisting on average of to railcars  variations in our sales lead to significant fluctuations in our operating profits and cash from operating activities 
we do not usually experience business credit issues  although a payment may be delayed pending completion of closing documentation  and a typical order of railcars may not yield cash proceeds until after the end of a reporting period 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the reduction of million in net income adjusted for non cash items and a decrease of million generated by working capital accounts such as accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  partially offset by the increase of million in cash applicable to payroll  pensions and postretirement obligations 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the addition of million in net income adjusted for non cash items and an increase of million generated by working capital accounts such as accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  partially offset by the use of million in cash applicable to payroll  pensions and postretirement obligations 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of the million of total capital expenditures was used for cost reduction initiatives and the expansion of production capacity to accommodate the manufacture of a new railcar type 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of capital expenditures of million partially offset by the proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment  primarily million from the sale of the shell plant in johnstown  pennsylvania 
for the year ended december   million of the million of total capital expenditures were used for the expansion of production capacity to accommodate the manufacture of hybrid stainless steel aluminum coal carrying railcars 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included million for stock repurchases  million to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and million related to deferred financing costs 
these were partially offset by the receipt of million for stock options exercised and million in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included million in stock options exercised and million in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
these were partially offset by the use of million to pay cash dividends to our stockholders 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of the million of total capital expenditures was used for the expansion of production capacity to accommodate the manufacture of hybrid stainless steel aluminum coal carrying railcars 
our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of the million total capital expenditures were used at a manufacturing facility  primarily relating to cost reduction initiatives and the expansion of production capacity to accommodate a new railcar type 
the remaining million of capital expenditures for the year ended december  were comprised primarily of expenditures for machinery and equipment and building improvements at our danville  johnstown and roanoke production facilities 
excluding unforeseen expenditures  management expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in these expenditures will be used to maintain our existing facilities and update manufacturing equipment 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include long lived assets  goodwill  pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  the valuation reserve on the net deferred tax asset  warranty accrual and contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held or used  we group a long lived asset or assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss for an asset group reduces only the carrying amounts of a long lived asset or assets of the group being evaluated 
our estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
our future cash flow estimates exclude interest charges 
we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
these changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
we routinely evaluate our manufacturing footprint to assess our manufacturing capacity and cost of production in an effort to optimize production at our low cost manufacturing facilities 
in december  we announced our planned closure of our manufacturing facility located in johnstown  pennsylvania and  as a result  we tested long lived assets at our johnstown facility for recoverability using estimated fair values 
we recorded impairment charges of  for land  building and improvements during there were no impairment charges recorded for long lived assets during or 
table of contents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded on our balance sheet both goodwill and intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents and an intangible asset related to our defined benefit plans 
on december  the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the derecognition of the intangible asset related to our defined benefit pension plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we perform the goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january of each year 
we also test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our company below its carrying amount 
these events or circumstances include the testing for recoverability under sfas no 
accordingly we tested goodwill for impairment as of december  in connection with our testing of long lived assets at our johnstown facility for recoverability  in addition to performing our annual test as of january  we also tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on january  and january  we have not noted any such impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually based on management s assessment of the fair value of our assets as compared to the carrying value of our assets 
additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment if the fair value of our assets and liabilities were less than their carrying value 
the process of assessing fair value involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volume  pricing  economic and industry data  anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions  and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
our method to determine fair value to test goodwill for impairment considers three valuation approaches the discounted cash flow method  the guideline company method and the transaction method 
the results of each of these three methods are reviewed by management and a fair value is then assigned 
for our latest valuation  as of december   management estimated that the fair value of our company exceeded the carrying value of our company by a substantial amount 
the discounted cash flow method involves significant judgment based on a market derived rate of return to discount short term and long term projections of the future performance of our company 
the major assumptions that influence future performance include volume projections based on an industry specific outlook for railcar demand and specifically coal railcar demand  estimated margins on railcar sales  and weighted average cost of capital or wacc used to discount future performance of our company 
we use industry data to estimate volume projections in our discounted cash flow method 
we believe that this independent industry data is the best indicator of expected future performance assuming that we maintain a consistent market share  which management believes is supportable based on historical performance 
while a negative adjustment to the volume projections used in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 
our estimated margins used in the discounted cash flow method are based primarily on historical margins 
the price of raw materials has increased significantly since november aluminum and steel prices have historically accounted for approximately to of our total cost of sales 
changes in aluminum and steel prices typically only affect margins on signed contracts for railcars forming part of our backlog as management historically has used aluminum and steel prices at the time a contract is signed as the basis for its selling price 
some of our contracts provide for raw material cost escalation and  with respect to the year ended december   we were able to pass through to our customers raw material cost increases on of railcar deliveries 
however  there is no assurance that our customers will accept variable pricing in the future  which would subject our margins and performance to variability primarily in the event of changes in the price of aluminum and steel 
while an increase of in aluminum and steel prices for backlog and projected volume in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 

table of contents the wacc used to discount our future performance in the discounted cash flow method is based on an estimated rate of return of companies in our industry and interest rates for corporate debt rated baa or the equivalent by moody s investors service 
management estimated a wacc of for our december  goodwill impairment valuation analysis based on our mix of equity and debt 
while an increase of in the wacc used in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 
the assumptions supporting our estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value  reflect our best estimates 
the guideline company method and transaction method use market valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies for the guideline company method and recent transactions for the transaction method and  as a result  involve less judgment in their application 
pensions and postretirement benefits we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets would be 
as permitted under sfas no 
 the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in our net periodic benefit cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic benefit cost 
we review the expected return on plan assets annually and would revise it if conditions should warrant 
a change of one percentage point in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which our pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined this rate to be  an increase of from the rate used at december  a change of one percentage point in the discount rate would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december   and  we recognized consolidated pre tax pension cost of million  million and million  respectively 
pension costs for include pension plan curtailment losses and special termination benefit costs of million resulting from our plant closure decision see note curtailment and impairment charges and note employee benefit plans for a description of these actions 
we currently expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans during however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
in august  president bush signed the pension protection act into law 
included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes  as well as minimum funding levels required by our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act and are expected to be fully funded by this expectation will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plan is fully funded as that term is 
table of contents defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized a consolidated pre tax postretirement welfare benefit cost of million  million and million  respectively 
postretirement welfare benefit costs for include plan curtailment losses and contractual benefit charges of million resulting from our plant closure decision see note curtailment and impairment charges and note employee benefit plans for a description of these actions 
we currently expect to pay approximately million during in postretirement welfare benefits 
income taxes on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb standard no 
fin no 
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements  uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
this interpretation requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets  liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance  adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  a decline in sales or margins and loss of market share 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determinations  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
at december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million 
although realization of our net deferred tax assets is not certain  management has concluded that we will more likely than not realize the full benefit of the deferred tax assets except for our net deferred tax assets in pennsylvania 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  based on management s conclusion that it was more likely than not that certain of our net deferred tax assets in pennsylvania would not be realized 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for items that are reported for financial statement purposes in periods different from those for income tax reporting purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset amounts are based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the deferred tax liabilities and assets that we record relate to the enacted federal  illinois and virginia tax rates  since net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets arising under pennsylvania state law have been fully reserved 
a change in the rate of federal income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of illinois income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of virginia income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by  
table of contents product warranties we establish a warranty reserve for railcars sold and estimate the amount of the warranty accrual based on the history of warranty claims for the type of railcar  adjusted for significant known claims in excess of established reserves 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of one to five years 
revenue recognition we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from third parties 
we recognize revenue on new and rebuilt railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk for any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
revenue from leasing is recognized ratably during the lease term 
pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 interpretations of apb no  on transactions involving used railcar trades  we recognize revenue for the entire transaction when the cash consideration is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value at date of receipt less a normal profit margin 
compensation expense under stock option agreements and restricted stock awards we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options and restricted stock 
at the date that an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the grant date 
the fair value of stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected exercise behavior  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements could be impacted 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies related to certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amounts of loss  in the determination of loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us based on our ongoing monitoring activities to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
if the amount of the actual loss is greater than the amount we have accrued  this would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded contingency losses of million which are included in our consolidated statements of income in selling  general and administrative expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments or certain liabilities based upon the entity s equity instruments for goods or services 
the revision to sfas no 
generally requires that publicly traded companies measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method and  as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb standard no 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recorded an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and a decrease to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss of million and  respectively 
we expect the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next twelve months  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
as of january   we recorded a liability of  for the payment of interest and penalties 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories  including a separate reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis  until january  for calendar year end entities 
other than the enhanced disclosures required  we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet  the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost  the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date  and disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition of gains and losses in the current period 
we adopted sfas no 
as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures required by sfas no 
and the effects of adoption 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits companies to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   although earlier adoption is permitted 
we do not intend to apply the provisions of sfas no 
to any of our existing financial assets or liabilities  therefore the provisions of sfas no 
are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 including that the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in a business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred 
this standard requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
sfas no 
r is effective for any business combination with an acquisition date on or after january  we are in the process of evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r but expect only prospective impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
table of contents and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this standard defines a noncontrolling interest  sometimes called minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent 
sfas no 
requires  among other items  that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity separate from the parent s equity  consolidated net income be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and the noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statement of income 
if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  sfas no 
requires any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary to be measured at fair value and a gain or loss to be recognized in net income based on such fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the impact on our financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements including  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
we have used the words may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  intend and similar expressions in this prospectus to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the cyclical nature of our business  adverse economic and market conditions  fluctuating costs of raw materials  including steel and aluminum  and delays in the delivery of raw materials  our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components  our reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales  the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders  the highly competitive nature of our industry  risks relating to our relationship with our unionized employees and their unions  our ability to manage our health care and pension costs  our reliance on the sales of our aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars  shortages of skilled labor  the risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings by our customers  the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations  the costs associated with being a public company  potential significant warranty claims  and various covenants in the agreement governing our indebtedness that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our businesses 
our actual results could be different from the results described in or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated 
given these uncertainties  you should not rely on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made 
we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws 
all of the forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a million revolving credit facility  which provides for financing of our working capital requirements and contains a million sub facility for letters of credit and a million sub facility for a swing line loan 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had issued approximately million in letters of credit under the sub facility for letters of credit 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on the borrowings under the revolving credit facility and do not plan to enter into swaps or other hedging arrangements to manage this risk  because we do not believe this interest rate risk to be significant 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facility will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
the production of railcars and our operations require substantial amounts of aluminum and steel 
the cost of aluminum  steel and all other materials including scrap metal used in the production of our railcars represents a significant majority of our direct manufacturing costs 
our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery of aluminum  steel and other materials  all of which are beyond our control 
the prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material inputs of our railcars  increased in  and as a result of strong demand  limited availability of production inputs for steel and aluminum  including scrap metal  industry consolidation and import trade barriers 
in addition  the price and availability of other railcar components that are made of steel have been adversely affected by the increased cost and limited availability of steel 
any fluctuations in the price or availability of aluminum or steel  or any other material used in the production of our railcars  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  if any of our suppliers were unable to continue its business or were to seek bankruptcy relief  the availability or price of the materials we use could be adversely affected 
we currently do not plan to enter into any hedging arrangements to manage the price risks associated with raw materials  although we may do so in the future 
historically  we have either renegotiated existing contracts or entered into new contracts with our customers that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  current market conditions and competitive pricing have limited our ability to negotiate variable pricing contracts 
when raw material prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers  which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in passing on increases in the cost of aluminum and steel to our customers  a increase in the cost of aluminum and steel would increase our average cost of sales by approximately per railcar  which  for the year ended december   would have reduced income before income taxes by approximately million 
we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange risks as our general policy is to denominate foreign sales and purchases in us dollars
