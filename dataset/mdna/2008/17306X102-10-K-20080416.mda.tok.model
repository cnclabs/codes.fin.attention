item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial and operating data and our audited financial statements and the respective related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a rapidly growing  value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family 
our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the preferences of fashion conscious consumers  particularly african americans 
originally our stores were located in the southeast  and in recent years we expanded into the mid atlantic and midwest regions and texas 
we operate stores in both urban and rural markets in states 
we are pursuing an aggressive store growth strategy and believe that the addition of new stores will be the primary source of future growth 
in fiscal we opened stores  entering the tulsa  oklahoma  detroit  michigan  chicago  illinois  and milwaukee  wisconsin markets 
we expect to open approximately new stores in fiscal approximately of the new stores we intend to open in fiscal will be located in states that we currently serve 
we measure performance using key operating statistics 
one of the main performance measures is comparable store sales growth 
we define a comparable store as a store that has been opened for an entire fiscal year 
therefore  a store will not be considered a comparable store until its th month of operation at the earliest or until its th month at the latest 
as an example  stores opened in fiscal and fiscal were not considered comparable stores in fiscal relocated and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
we also use other operating statistics  most notably average sales per store  to measure our performance 
as we typically occupy existing space in established shopping centers rather than sites built specifically for our stores  store square footage and therefore sales per square foot varies by store 
we focus on overall store sales volume as the critical driver of profitability 
the average sales per store has increased over the years  as we have increased comparable store sales and opened new stores that are generally larger than our historical store base 
average sales per store have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition to sales  we measure gross profit as a percent of sales and store operating expenses  with a particular focus on labor as a percentage of sales 
these results translate into store level contribution  which we use to evaluate overall performance of each individual store 
finally  we monitor corporate expenses against budgeted amounts 
basis of the presentation net sales consist of store sales and layaway fees  net of returns by customers 
cost of sales consists of the cost of products we sell and associated freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of store costs  including salaries and store occupancy costs  handling costs  corporate and distribution center costs and advertising costs 
we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january each of our fiscal quarters consists of four week periods  with an extra week added on to the fourth quarter every five to six years 
the years ended february   february   january   january  and january  are referred to as fiscal    and  respectively 
fiscal year is comprised of weeks 
fiscal years   and are each comprised of weeks 
results of operations the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the condensed financial statements set forth in the financial pages of this report 
the nature of our business is seasonal 
historically  sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
expenses  and to a greater extent operating income  vary by quarter 
results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year 
furthermore  the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 
net sales and additional operating data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of income data expressed both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  february  january  dollars in thousands statement of income data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following table provides information  for the periods indicated  about the number of total stores open at the beginning of the period  stores opened and closed during each period  total stores open at the end of each period and comparable store sales for the periods fiscal year ended february  february  january  total stores open  beginning of period new stores closed stores total stores open  end of period comparable store sales increase stores closed for one or more days due to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma are not included in this number 
the number of stores open at the end of the period includes one store closed as of january   as a result of hurricane wilma  which reopened in april stores included in the comparable store sales calculation for any period are those stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the preceding fiscal year and were still open at the end of such period 
relocated stores and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
the company is reporting comparable store sales on a comparable store and comparable week basis  for fiscal  the weeks ended february  are compared to the weeks ended february   for fiscal  the weeks ended february  are compared to the weeks ended february  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due to new store openings in fiscal  new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a full year of sales in  a comparable store sales increase of note that is based on a week fiscal compared to the comparable weeks in the prior year  partially offset by the week fiscal having an extra week 
the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the total increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  and the comparable stores contributed million of the increase in sales on a comparable week versus week basis  but had a million decrease on a fiscal year basis due to the extra week in fiscal sales in the extra week in fiscal were million 
the increase in comparable store sales on a comparable weeks basis included a slight increase in the number of items per sale transaction  partially offset by slight declines in the number of transactions and the average item price 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows children s  home  women s  men s  accessories 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores decreased 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is a result of the increase in sales  partially offset by a reduction in the gross margin 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a basis points increase in merchandise markdowns as a percentage of sales 
the increase in markdowns occurred in the third and fourth quarters due to negative comparable store sales during the months of september and october in the third quarter and during the critical month of december in the fourth quarter 
with comparable store sales being negative during those months  higher clearance markdowns were necessary 
inventory shrinkage was basis points higher year over year  however  the increase in shrinkage was offset by a slightly higher initial merchandise mark up and slightly lower freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal and approximately  of expenses related to a secondary stock offering and stock registration of which the company received no proceeds 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the deleveraging effect that occurs on expenses as a percentage of sales when comparable store sales increase at a rate   that is lower than the rate of inflation on expenses 
in particular  occupancy expenses as a percent of sales were up basis points and payroll was basis points higher 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as the result of capital expenditures incurred for new and relocated expanded stores and for new scanning technology used in the stores 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher interest rates and a slightly higher average investment balance throughout the year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the addition of a million capital equipment lease in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of continued increases in income tax credits and tax exempt interest income  while pretax income was decreasing 
net income 
net income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due to new store openings in fiscal  new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a full year of sales in  and a comparable store sales increase of note that is based on a week fiscal compared to the comparable weeks in the prior year 
the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the total increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  and the comparable stores contributed million of the increase in sales 
these sales increases were offset by million due to one store that was closed in fiscal sales in the rd week of fiscal were million 
approximately one half of the increase in comparable store sales was from a higher average item price  with the remainder due to an increase in customer transactions 
a greater consumer preference for branded goods played a large role in both the higher average item price and the increase in transactions 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows accessories  children s  home  men s  women s 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores increased gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily a result of our strong sales increases 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal although the gross profit as a percentage of sales did not change  markdown rates were higher as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher markdowns were offset by a higher initial mark up on merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the payment in fiscal of a million fee to terminate the consulting agreement with hampshire equity partners ii  lp formerly majority stockholder  property losses in fiscal from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma of approximately  and expenses of approximately  in fiscal related to our secondary offering  which was consummated on january  partially offsetting these favorable items were additional costs incurred by the company for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and increased insurance cost for property and medical coverage in fiscal  all of which totaled approximately million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as the result of capital expenditures incurred for new and relocated expanded stores 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due to the full year impact of interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the addition of a million capital equipment lease in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of our investment in tax exempt securities and an increase in job tax credits 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  expansion of our distribution infrastructure  construction of new stores  remodeling of our existing stores and the improvement of our information systems 
historically  we have met these cash requirements from cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  long term debt and capital leases  and cash proceeds from our initial public offering 
we expect to be able to meet future cash requirements with cash flow from operations  existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below  if necessary 
discussion of cash flows fiscal compared to fiscal at february   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared with total cash and cash equivalents of million at february  the most significant factors in the change in our net liquidity position during fiscal were positive cash flow from operations and net sales of marketable securities  offset by capital expenditures 
inventory represented of our total assets as of february  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the main sources of cash provided during fiscal were net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and noncash stock based compensation expense  totaling million  and an increase in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities of million 
uses of cash consisted of a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in prepaid assets 
the change in income taxes payable was substantially offset by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
accounts payable did not increase as would typically be the case when inventory increases  because inventory turns slowed down  particularly over the last five months of the year when comparable store sales were negative 
the decline in inventory turns forced us to take significantly more merchandise markdowns  as discussed in the gross profit section above  and caused us to slow down purchases in the last half of the year 
this reduction in purchases contributed to the decrease in accounts payable at year end 
additionally  we took advantage of more opportunistic purchases of pack and hold merchandise in such purchases are paid for well in advance of shipping the merchandise to our stores  causing a reduction in inventory turns and in accounts payable as a percentage of inventory 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to capital expenditures in the amount of million in fiscal for the build out of new stores and twelve store relocations expansions  purchase of our corporate headquarters inventory storage facility in savannah  ga that had previously been leased  construction work related to the expansion of the darlington  south carolina distribution center  and other general corporate purposes  compared to million million  excluding equipment financed by capital leases in fiscal for the build out of new stores and seven relocations expansions  purchase of markdown scanners  build out of our distribution center in darlington  and other general corporate purposes 
net sales of municipal auction rate securities provided cash of million in  while net purchases of such securities used cash of million in cash flows provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities consisted primarily of the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million in and million in  partially offset by repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million and million in and  respectively 
until required for other purposes  we maintain cash and cash equivalents in deposit or money market accounts 
fiscal compared to fiscal at february   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared with total cash and cash equivalents of million at january  the most significant factors in the change in our net liquidity position during fiscal were the positive cash flow from operations and the financing cash flows provided by tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options  offset by net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
inventory represented of our total assets as of february  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the main sources of cash provided during fiscal were net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and noncash stock based compensation expense  totaling million  increases in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities of million and an increase in accrued compensation of million 
uses of cash consisted of a million increase in inventory net of accounts payable and a million increase in prepaid assets 
the change in income taxes payable was substantially offset by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to capital expenditures in the amount of million million  excluding equipment financed by capital leases in fiscal for the build out of new stores and seven store relocations expansions  purchase of markdown scanners  build out of a distribution center in darlington and other general corporate purposes  compared to million million  excluding equipment financed by capital leases in fiscal for the build out of new stores and four relocations expansions  purchase of our distribution center in darlington and other general corporate purposes 
other uses of cash included net purchases of marketable securities of million in and million in cash flows provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the tax benefit from stock exercises of million  partially offset by repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of million  while in  there were million of proceeds from the initial public offering and  from stock option exercises  partially offset by a payment of million in connection with the redemption of our preferred stock and million of repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
until required for other purposes  we maintain cash and cash equivalents in deposit or money market accounts 
liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity consist of i cash and cash equivalents which equaled million as of february   ii trade credit  iii cash generated from operations on an ongoing basis as we sell our merchandise inventory  and iv as of march   a million revolving credit facility 
short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for inventory purchases 
trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been for working capital and capital expenditure needs 
at february   the company had million of short term investments in municipal auction rate securities ars issued by student loan funding organizations 
these securities are high grade aaa rated and approximately of them are either guaranteed by the department of education under the federal family education loan program or backed by insurance companies 
historically  the ars provided liquidity via an auction process that reset the interest rate every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
subsequent to february   there has been insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
as a result  we rolled over our investments  earning interest rates that were approximately higher  on average  than were being earned previously 
due to the lack of liquidity in the ars  we may not be able to access cash by selling these securities without incurring a loss of principal until either  liquidity returns to the auction process  a secondary market emerges  they are redeemed by the issuer  or they mature in years ranging from to we will assess the potential impairment in future periods based on several factors  including whether liquidity returns to the market  the forecasted recovery of the securities  and our ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
such an assessment may change the classification of these investments to long term or result in an impairment charge 
if we determine that the fair value of these securities is temporarily impaired  we would record a temporary charge within other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if it is determined that the fair value of these securities is other than temporarily impaired  we would record a loss in our statements of income 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million in fiscal these expenditures will relate to the purchase of property and equipment for approximately stores that we plan to open in fiscal and the completion of the expansion of our darlington distribution center 
we plan to finance these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of february  and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations represents fixed minimum rentals in stores and does not include incremental rents which are computed as a percentage of net sales 
for example  in fiscal incremental percentage rent was approximately million  which represented of total rent expense 
indebtedness 
we had a million revolving line of credit with wachovia capital finance secured by substantially all of our assets and pursuant to which we paid customary fees 
this secured line of credit expired on april  and was not renewed 
in september  we entered into a million unsecured revolving line of credit with bank of america that expired on june  this facility was renewed for a period of one year  expiring june  borrowings under this credit agreement bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
at february   there were no outstanding borrowings on the unsecured revolving line of credit 
subsequent to february   the company obtained a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  replacing the million facility described above 
this facility has a term of days  has an unused commitment fee equal to  and has one restrictive financial covenant adjusted leverage ratio 
loans under the facility shall bear interest at either a a rate equal to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus and ii bank of america s prime rate  plus an applicable margin  or b a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on the company s adjusted leverage ratio and ranges from to for libor based loans  and from to for prime rate based loans 
we have had no borrowings under this facility 
capital leases 
we have capital lease obligations that financed the purchase of technology equipment 
as of february   our capital lease obligations were million 
these obligations have maturity dates ranging from may to december the interest rates on these obligations range from to 
all of these obligations are secured by the technology equipment 
the lease agreements contain cross default provisions which result in a default if the company is out of compliance with any other borrowing agreements 
operating leases 
we lease our stores under operating leases  which generally have an initial term of five years with one five year renewal option 
the typical store lease requires a combination of both fixed monthly rentals and rentals computed as percentage of net sales after a certain sales threshold has been met 
included in our operating lease contractual obligations are the minimum monthly rental payments for our los angeles and new york city buyers offices 
for fiscal  rental expense was million compared to million in fiscal including approximately million and million of percentage rent  respectively  in fiscal and 
construction 
we have executed various agreements with a construction company and certain other providers of services and equipment  which commit the company to the expansion of its distribution center in darlington  south carolina and the later implementation of a new warehouse management system 
the distribution center is expected to be substantially completed in the spring of  while implementation of the new warehouse management system is anticipated in the last half of the aggregate cost of the projects is presently expected to approximate million 
through february   approximately million of the cost of these projects has been paid 
purchase obligations 
as of february   we had purchase obligations of million  all of which were for less than one year 
these purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding merchandise orders 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the store operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
outstanding stock options as of february   we had outstanding vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and outstanding unvested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
the per share value of each share of common stock underlying the vested and unvested options  based on the difference between the exercise price per option and the estimated fair market value of the shares at the dates of the grant of the options also referred to as intrinsic value  ranges from to per share 
based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on february   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding on february  was million  of which million related to vested options and  related to unvested options 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition while the recognition of revenue is predominantly derived from routine retail transactions and does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of ours 
we recognize retail sales net of sales taxes at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for  less an allowance for returns 
we allow for returns up to ten days after the date of sales and we reduce revenues for each fiscal year for returns in the ten days after the period ends 
at february   the reserve for returns was  revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer has paid for and received the merchandise 
layaway service charges  which are non refundable  are recognized in revenue when collected 
all sales are from cash  check or major credit card company transactions 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to revenue recognition during fiscal inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market as determined by the retail inventory method  less a provision for estimated inventory shrinkage 
under the retail inventory method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in actual shrinkage trends 
inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales has ranged from to during fiscal years through we believe the first in  first out retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
we do not generally enter into such arrangements with our vendors 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment  net we have a significant investment in property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives primarily three to five years for computer equipment and furniture  fixtures and equipment  five years for leasehold improvements and fifteen years for buildings of the related assets or the relevant lease term including renewals that are reasonably assured  whichever is shorter 
any reduction in these estimated useful lives would result in a higher annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for long lived assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset  including property and equipment  may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different from historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges during fiscal years through there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to impairment of long lived assets during fiscal stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r during the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair value of the award 
the determination of the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using an option price model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to the stock based compensation plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal operating leases we lease all of our store properties and account for the leases as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
many lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing rent holidays at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
for tenant improvement allowances we record a deferred rent liability on the balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
these contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to operating leases during fiscal accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the computation of income taxes is subject to estimation due to the judgment required and the uncertainty related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets or the outcome of tax audits 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is determined that actual results will differ from its estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the year in which such changes are enacted 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to income taxes during fiscal the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of any taxes presented on a gross basis should be disclosed  if significant 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present sales net of sales taxes 
eitf did not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions  as defined therein 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
in may  the fasb issued fsp fin  definition of a settlement in fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin 
fsp fin clarifies when a tax position is considered settled under fin per fsp fin  a tax position is considered effectively settled upon completion of the examination by the taxing authority without being legally extinguished 
for effectively settled tax positions  a company can recognize the full amount of the tax benefit 
fsp fin was effective with the company s adoption of fin on february   the company adopted the provisions of fin fin requires that each tax position be reviewed and assessed with recognition and measurement of the tax benefit based on a more likely than not standard with respect to the ultimate outcome  regardless of whether this assessment is favorable or unfavorable 
the company has completed its review and assessment of all tax positions and during fiscal year recorded a net benefit to retained earnings and a decrease to current liabilities of  in accordance with the new accounting guidance 
the company files income tax returns in us federal and state jurisdictions and is subject to examinations by the irs and other taxing authorities 
at february   there were no benefits taken on the company s income tax returns that do not qualify for financial statement recognition under fin under fin  if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties and interest  a company is required to recognize an expense for the amount of the interest and penalty in the period in which the company claims or expects to claim the position on its tax return 
for financial statement purposes  fin allows companies to elect whether to classify such charges as either income tax expense or another expense classification 
should such expense be incurred in the future  the company will classify such interest as a component of interest expense and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas no 
 as issued  are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  at the february  meeting  the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas and agreed to defer for one year the effective date of statement for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
also in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  application of fasb statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in june we began investing excess cash in auction rate securities ars 
at february   the company had million of short term investments in municipal auction rate securities issued by student loan funding organizations 
these securities are high grade aaa rated and approximately of them are either guaranteed by the department of education under the federal family education loan program ffelp or backed by insurance companies 
approximately of the ars are guaranteed under ffelp  while are backed by insurance from ambac assurance corporation ambac and are backed by mbia insurance corporation mbia 
the s p equivalent ratings as of february  for both ambac and mbia were aaa  with a negative watch  however  both were subsequently taken off negative watch and their aaa ratings were reaffirmed 
historically  the ars provided liquidity via an auction process that reset the interest rate every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
subsequent to february   there has been insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
we may not be able to access cash by selling these securities without incurring a loss of principal until either  liquidity returns to the auction process  a secondary market emerges  they are redeemed by the issuer  or they mature in years ranging from to we will assess the potential impairment in future periods based on several factors  including whether liquidity returns to the market  the forecasted recovery of the securities  and our ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
such an assessment may change the classification of these investments to long term or result in an impairment charge 
if we determine that the fair value of these securities is temporarily impaired  we would record a temporary charge within other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if it is determined that the fair value of these securities is other than temporarily impaired  we would record a loss in our statements of income 
we are also exposed to financial market risks related to changes in interest rates connected with our revolving lines of credit  which bear interest at variable rates 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates 
as a result  future results may differ materially from estimated results due to adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes and have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
we source all of our product from apparel markets in the united states in us dollars and  therefore  are not subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices
