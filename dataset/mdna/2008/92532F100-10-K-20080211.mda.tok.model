item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
telaprevir  our lead drug candidate  is an oral hepatitis c protease inhibitor and one of the most advanced of a new class of antiviral treatments in clinical development that targets hcv infection  a life threatening disease 
we expect to begin a phase clinical trial of telaprevir in march to evaluate week telaprevir based treatment regimens in treatment na ve patients with genotype hcv 
we have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology  pharmacology  biophysics  chemistry  automation and information technologies in a coordinated manner  with the goal of more efficiently identify promising drug candidates to address significant unmet medical needs 
using this drug discovery capability we have identified among other drug candidates vx and vx  two novel drug candidates targeting cystic fibrosis  vx and vx  two second generation hcv protease inhibitors  and vx  a novel jak inhibitor that targets immune mediated inflammatory diseases 
we have a number of other drug candidates in clinical trials or preclinical studies being developed either by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies  including drug candidates targeting cancer  imid and pain and other neurological diseases and disorders 
we are building our drug development  supply chain management and commercialization organizations to prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir and to support the development of other drug candidates in our pipeline 
we are conducting a comprehensive global clinical development program for telaprevir in collaboration with janssen and mitsubishi tanabe 
this program is designed to support potential registration of telaprevir by us in north america and our collaborators in international markets for treatment na ve and treatment experienced patients across a range of hcv genotypes 
in march  we expect to begin a phase clinical trial that is designed to enroll  patients and evaluate week telaprevir based treatment regimens 
in addition  in the third quarter of we expect to begin enrollment in a clinical trial to evaluate a week telaprevir based treatment regimen 
this clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately treatment na ve patients with genotype hcv 
we have a number of ongoing telaprevir clinical trials  including the three phase b prove clinical trials we are conducting and several other clinical trials being conducted by our collaborators 
we are conducting a phase a clinical trial of vx and phase a clinical trials of vx and vx we expect to begin a phase a clinical trial of vx  a jak inhibitor in mid our pipeline also includes several cancer drug candidates that are being developed by our collaborators  and fosamprenavir calcium  our hiv protease inhibitor  which is being marketed by our collaborator glaxosmithkline plc as lexiva in the united states and telzir in europe 
our net loss for was million  which included stock based compensation expense of million and restructuring expense of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by million during to million on december  we expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will need significant additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of telaprevir and to continue the development of our other drug candidates 
business focus we currently are focusing a high proportion of our financial and management resources on telaprevir 
prior to our development of telaprevir  we relied on pharmaceutical company collaborators to develop and market our drug candidates that advanced to late stage clinical trials or commercialization 
we are developing telaprevir ourselves in north america  while we share development costs and responsibilities with janssen in the development and commercialization of telaprevir in the rest of the world except the far east 
although we believe that our development activities and the clinical trial data we have obtained to date have significantly reduced the risks associated with ultimately obtaining marketing approval for telaprevir  completing development and successfully commercializing telaprevir will require a substantial additional financial investment over the next several years 
in and the following years  we expect to invest significant resources to expand our capabilities in clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality control and commercial operations and to build and manage a commercial supply chain as we continue development and prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
we cannot be sure that our development of telaprevir will lead successfully to regulatory approval  or that obtaining regulatory approval will lead to commercial success 
in addition to telaprevir  we are investing significant research and development resources across a relatively broad array of therapeutic areas  due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business and the relatively high potential for failure of any specific effort 
this diversification strategy requires more significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more limited approach or focused exclusively on telaprevir 
in particular  in we expect to invest significant resources in order to advance the development of vx  vx  vx  vx and vx  and to start clinical trials of one or more additional compounds that are currently emerging from our research activities 
we believe that we will be able to take advantage of the expansion of our drug development and commercialization investments for telaprevir as we progress these other opportunities 
in the past  we have sought collaborator funding for a significant portion of our research activities  which required that we grant to those collaborators exclusive rights to develop and commercialize drug candidates generated by that research 
in recent years  we have funded a greater proportion of our research programs using internal funds rather than collaborator funds 
we expect to continue this approach to the extent we are able to do so in light of our financial and personnel resources 
we adopted this strategy with the aim of retaining greater development control of  and commercial rights with respect to  those proprietary drug candidates that may meet our strategic internal investment criteria as in effect from time to time 
discovery and development process discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process  which may take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing 
the toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation method or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence which  if any  of our current research and development efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product 
we monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently evaluate our portfolio investments in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and is analyzed and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
clinical development designing and coordinating large scale clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of drug candidates and support the submission of an nda requires significant financial resources  along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and infrastructure 
prior to commencing a late stage clinical trial of a drug candidate  we must work collaboratively with regulatory authorities  including the fda  in order to identify the specific scientific issues that need to be addressed by the clinical trials in order to support continued development or approval of the drug candidate 
these discussions typically occur over a period of months and can result in significant changes to planned clinical trial designs or timelines 
in addition  even after agreement with respect to a clinical trial design has been reached  regulatory authorities may request additional clinical trials or changes to existing clinical trial protocols 
if the data from our ongoing clinical trials or non clinical studies regarding the safety or efficacy of our drug candidates  and in particular telaprevir  are not favorable  we may be forced to delay or terminate the clinical development program  which would materially harm our business 
further  even if we gain marketing approvals from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner  we cannot be sure that the drug will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market 
each of our programs requires a significant investment of financial and personnel resources  time and expertise by us and or any program collaborators to realize its full clinical and commercial value 
development investment at this stage is subject to the considerable risk that any one or more of these drug candidates will not progress to product registration due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes 
this could place our entire investment in the drug candidate at risk 
while we attempt to stage our investments to mitigate these financial risks  drug discovery and development by its nature is a very risky undertaking and staging of investment is not always possible or desirable 
we expect to continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and nonclinical data in each program throughout and in subsequent years 
drug candidates hcv telaprevir is an hcv protease inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of hcv infection 
we are conducting a comprehensive global clinical development program with our collaborators that is designed to support potential registration of telaprevir for treatment na ve and treatment experienced patients across a range of hcv genotypes 
in march  we expect to begin a phase clinical trial that is designed to enroll  patients and evaluate week telaprevir based treatment regimens 
in addition  in the third quarter of we expect to begin enrollment of approximately treatment na ve patients in a clinical trial to evaluate a week telaprevir based treatment regimen 
we expect svr data from all treatment arms of the phase clinical trial by the first half of and from the other clinical trial by mid in addition  three major phase b clinical trials of telaprevir are ongoing in our prove program prove in the united states and prove in european union  both in treatment na ve patients  and prove in both north america and the european union  in patients who did not achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon based treatments 
all three prove trials are fully enrolled  and patient dosing has been completed in prove and prove in addition  our collaborator tibotec is conducting a phase clinical trial to evaluate twice daily dosing of telaprevir  a phase clinical trial to evaluate telaprevir in patients with genotype and genotype hcv and a phase clinical trial to evaluate telaprevir in patients with genotype hcv 
we face competition in the area of treatment of hcv infection based  among other things  on the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates and the timing and scope of regulatory approvals 
we believe that the first company that is able to successfully develop and obtain marketing approval for a new orally available treatment for hcv infection that increases the portion of patients who achieve svr and decreases the duration of treatment may have a significant competitive advantage over later approved therapies for hcv infection 
we believe that telaprevir has advanced further along the clinical development pathway than any other new and potentially competing oral hcv therapy 
svr data from the trials we expect to enroll in will not be available until approximately months after the last patient is enrolled in the trial 
we will try to dose and complete the analysis of the data from our planned clinical trials as rapidly as possible  in order to maintain the time to market advantage we believe that we have in relation to drug candidates being developed by our competitors 
we also are making significant progress in completing manufacturing process and procedures  and accumulating product inventory necessary for a successful product launch 
we also have initiated a phase a clinical trial of vx  a second generation oral hcv protease inhibitor  and expect to start clinical trials of vx in cystic fibrosis we are conducting clinical trials of two drug candidates for the treatment of patients with cf vx  an investigational potentiator compound designed to enhance the activity of cftr proteins in patients with gating defects  which we are evaluating in a phase a clinical trial  and vx  an investigational corrector compound designed to increase the concentration of cftr proteins on the cell surface in patients with trafficking defects  which we are evaluating in a phase a clinical trial 
immune mediated inflammatory disease vx is one of the novel oral jak inhibitors that we are evaluating in preclinical testing 
we believe that vx has the potential to be used in multiple immune mediated inflammatory disease indications 
we expect to begin a phase a clinical trial of vx in mid manufacturing and commercialization strategy we will be responsible for supplying and commercializing telaprevir for sale in north america if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval 
in  we made significant progress in preparing for the commercial supply and marketing of telaprevir in support of a timely and effective commercial product launch in subsequent years  if we are successful in obtaining regulatory marketing approval 
establishing the commercial supply chain for telaprevir is a multi step international endeavor involving the purchase of several raw materials  the application of certain manufacturing processes requiring significant lead times to the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  the conversion of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to tablet form and the packaging of tablets for distribution 
we expect to source raw materials  drug substance and drug product  including finished packaging  from third parties located in china  the european union  japan and the united states  and we have established and currently are expanding those third party relationships 
establishing and providing quality assurance for this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment  experienced personnel and the creation or expansion of numerous third party contractual relationships 
because of the significant lead times involved in our supply chain for telaprevir  we may have less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if we had shorter lead times 
we have successfully completed the technical development work for the phase and commercial formulation of telaprevir 
we expect that the level of our investment in commercial supply of telaprevir  including costs related to building our internal infrastructure and costs related to third party manufacturing relationships  will increase significantly in while most of this investment will relate specifically to telaprevir  and is at risk if telaprevir does not advance successfully to registration  we expect that the organization and expertise that we build as part of this process will contribute to our development as a pharmaceutical company  and that these capabilities could help us advance our other  earlier stage drug candidates if they progress to a commercial manufacturing stage 
similarly  we have limited experience as a company in sales and marketing or with respect to pricing and obtaining adequate third party reimbursement for drugs 
we successfully concluded a search in for the head of commercial and strategic development 
in order to market telaprevir in north america if it is approved  we intend to build a marketing organization and a direct sales force  which will require substantial effort and significant management and financial resources 
during  we intend to commit significant personnel and financial resources to this effort  staging our commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the telaprevir development timeline 
we continue to devote significant effort  in particular  to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
although our investment in this infrastructure might be lost if telaprevir is not approved or if approval is significantly delayed  we would expect our sales and marketing infrastructure for telaprevir  if telaprevir is successfully developed and commercialized  to be useful to us if and when we commercialize any additional drugs 
financing strategy at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our research and development operations  our creation of a product supply and commercial infrastructure and our overhead  and to meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations 
in the past  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
while we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in addition to amounts we expect to receive from our collaborators under existing contractual agreements would be sufficient to fund our operations through  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital in from public offerings or private placements of our securities  agreements with third parties with respect to certain of our assets or other methods of financing in order to continue our operations through we cannot be sure that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs  including clinical trials  incur significant cash exit costs  or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  drugs or drug candidates 
corporate collaborations corporate collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with janssen pharmaceutica  nv  a johnson johnson company  relating to telaprevir 
in july  janssen paid us a non refundable license payment of million 
under our agreement with janssen  we have retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in north america  and we are leading the global clinical development program 
janssen has agreed to be responsible for of the drug development costs under the planned development program for telaprevir in north america and the janssen territories  to pay us contingent milestone payments based on successful development  approval and launch of telaprevir  and to be responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir outside of north america and the far east 
janssen will also pay us significant royalties on any telaprevir product sales in janssen s territory 
our pipeline also includes several drug candidates that are being developed by our collaborators mk vx and vx which are being investigated by merck for oncology indications  and avn vx  which is being investigated by avalon pharmaceuticals for oncology indications 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that our application of the accounting policies for revenue recognition  research and development expenses  restructuring expense  stock based compensation expense and investments  all of which are important to our financial condition and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and for revenue arrangements entered into after june   emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following non refundable  up front license fees  funding of research and or development efforts  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
agreements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on each unit s fair value or using the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
research and development funding is recognized as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
substantive milestones achieved in collaboration arrangements are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  subject to the following policies in those circumstances where we have obligations remaining after achievement of the milestone in those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone payment is reasonably assured  we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement and we have sufficient evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations  we consider the milestone payment and the remaining obligations to be separate units of accounting 
in these circumstances  we use the residual method under eitf to allocate revenue among the milestones and the remaining obligations 
in those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone payment is reasonably assured  we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement  and we do not have sufficient evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations  we consider the milestone payment and the remaining obligations under the contract as a single unit of accounting 
in those circumstances where the collaboration does not require specific deliverables at specific times or at the end of the contract term  but rather our obligations are satisfied over a period of time  substantive milestone payments are recognized over the period of performance 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
at the inception of the agreement  we evaluate whether milestones are substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone as well as the level of effort and investment required 
milestones that are not considered substantive and that do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
payments received or reasonably assured after performance obligations are met completely are recognized as revenue 
royalty revenues are recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee and are recognized in the period the sales occur 
we reconcile and adjust for differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues in the quarter they become known and these differences have not historically been significant 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded by research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in telaprevir which are considered research and development expenses due to telaprevir s stage of development  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of the costs  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services and investment in commercial supply in telaprevir  incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
restructuring expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred  in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
the liability for accrued restructuring expense of million at december  is related to that portion of our facility in kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy 
this liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of the net amount of our ongoing obligation 
as prescribed by sfas  we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of the subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
for example  we currently have two subleases for portions of the kendall square facility with remaining terms of three and five years  respectively  and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases 
market variability may require adjustments to those assumptions in the future 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated or expires  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
stock based compensation expense we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards board no 
r  share based payment sfas r  on january  sfas r requires us to measure compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and to recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the employees service periods generally the vesting period of the equity award or the derived service period for awards with market conditions 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and accordingly  financial statement amounts for the periods prior to january  that are presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method 
under sfas r  we calculate the fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  or if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  our results could be materially affected 
altus investment in and  we assessed our investment in altus pharmaceuticals inc  which we accounted for using the cost method  on a quarterly basis to determine if there had been any decrease in the estimated fair value of that investment below its million carrying value that might have required us to write down the cost basis of the asset 
in and  we did not identify facts or circumstances that would cause us to determine that the cost basis of our interest in altus should have been changed 
if any adjustment to the estimated fair value of the investment had reflected a decline in the value of the investment below its cost  we would have considered the evidence available to us  including the duration and extent to which the decline was other than temporary 
if the decline had been considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment would have been written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down would have been included in the consolidated statements of operations 
altus completed an initial public offering of its common stock in january in  we sold  shares of altus common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of altus common stock for million  resulting in realized net gain of million  based on the difference between the proceeds of the sales and the carrying value of the asset 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of million  or per basic and diluted common share 
included in our net loss for was stock based compensation expense of million and restructuring expense of million 
included in our net loss for was stock based compensation expense of million  restructuring expense of million  loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of million  gains related to an investment of million and the effect of a cumulative benefit of an accounting change  related to the adoption of sfas r of million 
our net loss for increased by million as compared to  and our expenses changed significantly period to period 
in particular  our research and development expenses increased by million from to  including a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
overall  our total costs and expenses increased by million from to in addition  our total revenues decreased by million from to our net loss per basic and diluted common share increased in from as a result of an increase in the net loss partially offset by an increase in the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding from million shares in to million shares in revenues total revenues decreased to million in from million in in  revenues were comprised of million in royalties and million in collaborative and other research and development revenues as compared to million in royalties and million in collaborative and other research and development revenues in royalties consist of lexiva telzir fosamprenavir calcium royalty revenues and a small amount of agenerase amprenavir royalty revenues 
royalty revenues are based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the million  or  increase in royalty revenues from to was due to the increase in lexiva telzir net sales 
collaborative and other research and development revenues decreased million  or  from to the table presented below is a summary of revenues from collaborative arrangements for and in thousands collaborative and other research and development revenues janssen   merck   novartis  cfft   other   total collaborative and other research and development revenues in june  we entered into a major collaboration agreement with janssen that resulted in million and million of revenues in and  respectively  including in each period  an amortized portion of the million up front payment  in each period  net reimbursements from janssen for telaprevir development costs  and in  a milestone of million in connection with commencement of patient enrollment in prove  and a milestone of million for achieving specified interim results from our phase clinical trials of telaprevir in treatment na ve patients  in  a milestone of million for achieving specified interim results in prove our revenues from merck decreased by million in as compared to in  all of our revenues related to the merck collaboration were the result of recognizing a milestone payment 
in  we recognized revenues related to both milestone payments and in connection with funding for the research program with merck  which was completed during revenues from other collaborations decreased in as compared to primarily as the result of the expiration during the second quarter of of the research collaboration with novartis pharma ag  together with the corresponding research funding 
in  we expect that our revenues from janssen will increase 
we expect that for the foreseeable future the revenues and funding from collaborations that support our development stage compounds  such as the janssen collaboration  will provide a proportionately higher level of financial support for our research and development activities than revenues and funding from research collaboration agreements 
costs and expenses royalty payments royalty payments increased million  or  to million in from million in royalty payments relate to a royalty we pay to a third party on net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  including stock based compensation expense of million  from million in  including stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily the result of increased development investment to support the global phase b clinical development program for telaprevir  as well as a million increase in our investment in building commercial supply of telaprevir for use if telaprevir receives marketing approval  together with a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the cost of developing the commercial supply for telaprevir is considered a research and development expense due to telaprevir s stage of development 
development expenses increased by million  accounting for of the aggregate increase in research and development expenses 
research expenses increased by million  of which million was increased stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  commercial supply investment in telaprevir  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
set forth below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for and change change in thousands research expenses salary and benefits    stock based compensation expense    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services   infrastructure costs    total research expenses    development expenses salary and benefits    stock based compensation expense    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services    commercial supply investment in telaprevir   infrastructure costs    total development expenses    total research and development expenses salary and benefits    stock based compensation expense    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services    commercial supply investment in telaprevir   infrastructure costs    total research and development expenses   to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
in  we expect to focus our development investment on telaprevir  while continuing to advance the development of vx  vx and vx we expect research and development expenses in to be greater than in due to increased investment in clinical development  as well as increased costs for the investment in commercial supply of telaprevir drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory marketing approval 
in addition  we expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the planned development of our lead drug candidates 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase and phase clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is the result of increased headcount to support our growth as we advance our drug candidates  particularly telaprevir  into late stage development 
we expect that our sales  general and administration expenses in will be significantly higher than in  because we are planning to build our capabilities in late stage development  drug supply  quality control and safety monitoring and registration and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
restructuring expense we recorded restructuring expense of million in compared to million in the increase in restructuring expense for compared to was primarily the result of revising certain key estimates and assumptions about building operating costs for the remaining period of the lease commitment for our kendall square facility 
the charge in both periods included imputed interest cost related to the restructuring liability 
the activity related to the restructuring liability for is as follows in thousands liability as of december  cash payments in cash received from subleases in additional charge in liability as of december  lease restructuring liability    the activity related to the restructuring liability for is as follows in thousands liability as of december  cash payments in cash received from subleases in additional charge in liability as of december  lease restructuring liability    in accordance with sfas  we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the kendall square lease on at least a quarterly basis  and will make whatever modifications we believe necessary to reflect any changed circumstances  based on our best judgment  until the termination of the lease 
our estimates have changed in the past  and may change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
we expect to require significant additional capital in order to commercialize telaprevir and continue our planned activities in other areas 
there can be no assurance that financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  and if adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail our operations or relinquish our rights to significant assets 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  which was a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of cash expenditures we made in related to research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses  and million of cash that was used to repay our notes at maturity 
these cash outflows were partially offset by royalty  milestone and other payments from our collaborators and by million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefits plans 
capital expenditures for property and equipment during were million 
at december   we had million in loans outstanding under the loan facility established under our collaboration with novartis  which is repayable  without interest  in may in the third quarter of  we repaid million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due september during the first quarter of  holders of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due february converted their notes into  shares of our common stock at a price of in principal amount per share 
as a result of the conversion of the notes in the first quarter of and the repayment of the notes in the third quarter of  no convertible debt was outstanding as of december  our accrued restructuring expense of million at december  relates to the portion of the kendall square facility that we do not intend to occupy and includes other related lease obligations  recorded at net present value 
in  we made cash payments of million against the accrued expense and received million in sublease rental payments 
we expect to make cash payments of million against the accrued expense in and receive million in sublease rental payments 
we review our estimates underlying our accrued restructuring expense on at least a quarterly basis  and the amount of the accrued expense  and consequently any expected future payment  could change with any change in our estimates 
we expect to maintain our substantial investment in research at levels generally comparable to our level of investment in we expect also to continue to make significant investments in our development pipeline  particularly in clinical trials of telaprevir  in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of telaprevir  and in clinical trials for our second generation hcv drug candidate vx  and for vx and vx  our cf drug candidates 
we also expect to continue to make a significant investment in the commercial supply of telaprevir in order to have our third party manufacturers supply sufficient quantities of drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory marketing approval  to support a timely commercial product launch if we are successful in completing the development of telaprevir and obtaining marketing approval 
we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
while we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in addition to amounts we expect to receive our collaborators under existing contractual obligations would be sufficient to fund our operations through  we expect we will need to raise additional capital in through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements  or other methods of financing in order to continue our planned business activities through any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  drugs or drug candidates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of our investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
