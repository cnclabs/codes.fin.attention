md a should be read in conjunction with the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
progress energy introduction our reportable business segments and their primary operations include pec primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina  and pef primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of florida 
the corporate and other segment primarily includes the operations of the parent  progress energy service company  llc pesc and other miscellaneous nonregulated businesses that do not separately meet the quantitative requirements as a separate business segment 
strategy we are an integrated energy company primarily focused on the end use electricity markets 
over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting the majority of our nonregulated businesses 
our two electric utilities operate in regulated retail utility markets in the southeastern united states and have access to robust wholesale markets in the eastern united states  which we believe positions us well for long term growth 
please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
we are focused on the following key priorities consistently excelling in the daily fundamentals of our utility business  including safely and reliably generating and delivering power to our customers  successfully implementing our balanced solution to responsibly address demand growth and climate change  maintaining constructive regulatory relations  and achieving our financial objectives year after year 
the utilities operate in the southeastern united states  one of the fastest growing regions of the country  and had a net increase of approximately  customers over the past year 
despite our anticipated customer growth  the utilities are subject to economic fluctuations and the corresponding impact on our customers  including downturns in the housing and consumer credit markets 
under normal weather conditions  we anticipate approximately percent to percent annual retail kilowatt hour kwh sales growth at pec and approximately percent to percent annual retail kwh sales growth at pef in the utilities seek a mix of percent retail and percent wholesale 
the utilities are focused on maintaining their regulated wholesale business through targeted contract renewals and origination opportunities 
we are implementing a comprehensive plan to meet the anticipated demand in the utilities service territories by focusing on energy efficiency  alternative energy and state of the art power generation 
first  we are enhancing our demand side management dsm  energy efficiency and energy conservation programs 
recent legislation in north carolina and florida provides recovery for eligible costs of these programs 
second  we are pursuing renewable and alternative energy to increase the proportion of renewable and alternative energy sources in our generation portfolio 
recent legislation in north carolina established a minimum renewable energy portfolio standard beginning in executive orders issued by the governor of florida address the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and may lead to renewable energy standards in florida 
the utilities have requested proposals for alternative energy sources  and options being considered include conversion of waste such as wood  scrap tires and landfill gas to energy  biomass as well as investments in solar and fuel cell programs 
third  we are evaluating new generation and fleet upgrades as we estimate that we will require new baseload generation facilities at both pec and pef toward the end of the next decade 
we are evaluating the best available options for new generation  including advanced design nuclear technology  gas fired combined cycle and combustion turbines  and modernization of existing coal plants to use clean coal technology 
the considerations that will factor into this decision include  but are not limited to  construction costs  fuel diversity  transmission and site availability  environmental impact  the rate impact to customers and our ability to obtain cost effective financing 
on february   pec filed its combined license col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris 
we anticipate filing a col application in to potentially construct new nuclear plants in florida 
filing of a col is not a commitment to build a nuclear plant but is a necessary step to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
if we decide to pursue nuclear expansion  favorable changes in the regulatory and construction processes have evolved in recent years  including standardized design  detailed design before construction  col to build and operate  streamlined regulatory approval process  annual prudence reviews and cost recovery mechanisms for pre construction and financing costs 
state regulatory processes are specific to each jurisdiction 
also  nuclear generation has recently gained greater public support as a reliable energy source that does not emit greenhouse gases 
see other matters nuclear matters for additional information 
we are subject to significant air quality regulations passed in by the united states environmental protection agency epa that affect our fossil fuel fired generating facilities  the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean air visibility rule cavr and mercury regulation see other matters environmental matters for discussion regarding clean air mercury rule camr 
additionally  at pec s coal fired facilities in north carolina  we are subject to the north carolina clean smokestacks act enacted in clean smokestacks act 
including estimated costs for cair  cavr  mercury regulation and the clean smokestacks act  we currently estimate that total future capital expenditures for the utilities to comply with current environmental laws and regulations addressing air and water quality  which are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or pass through clauses  could be in excess of million at pec and billion at pef through  which corresponds to the latest emission reduction deadline 
in addition  growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of carbon dioxide co and other greenhouse gases 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by some proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
the utilities successfully resolved key state regulatory issues in  including retail fuel recovery filings in all jurisdictions 
pef also received federal energy regulatory commission ferc approval of its revised open access transmission tariff oatt  including a settlement agreement with major transmission customers 
in addition to florida energy legislation enacted in that included cost recovery mechanisms supportive of nuclear expansion  north carolina and south carolina both enacted energy legislation in north carolina s comprehensive energy bill included provisions for expanding the traditional fuel clause  renewable energy portfolio standards  recovery of qualified dsm efficiency programs and cost recovery during baseload generation construction 
key elements of south carolina s energy law included expansion of the annual fuel clause and recovery mechanisms and streamlined regulatory processes supportive of nuclear expansion 
as part of the clean smokestacks act  pec operated under a base rate freeze in north carolina through subsequent to  pec s current north carolina base rates are continuing subject to traditional cost based rate regulation 
as a result of its base rate proceeding  pef s base rate settlement extends through see other matters regulatory environment and note for further information 
we have several key financial objectives  the first of which is to achieve sustainable earnings growth 
in addition  we seek to continue our track record of dividend growth  as we have increased our dividend for consecutive years  and of the last years 
we plan to continue our efforts to enhance balance sheet strength and flexibility so that we are positioned to accommodate the significant future growth expected at the utilities 
as of the end of  our debt to total capitalization ratio was percent 
our targeted debt to total capitalization ratio is percent 
our ability to meet these financial objectives is largely dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the utilities 
the utilities earnings and operating cash flows are heavily influenced by weather  the economy  demand for electricity related to customer growth  actions of regulatory agencies  cost controls  and the timing of recovery of fuel costs and storm damage 
the utilities contributed million of our segment profit and generated substantially all of our consolidated cash flow from operations in partially offsetting the utilities segment profit contribution were losses of million recorded at corporate and other  primarily related to interest expense on holding company debt 
while the utilities expect retail sales growth in the future  they are facing  and expect to continue to face  rising costs 
the utilities remain committed to minimizing the expected growth in operation and maintenance o m expenses by effectively managing costs 
the utilities are allowed to recover prudently incurred fuel costs through the fuel portion of our rates  which are adjusted annually in each state 
we are focused on mitigating the impact of rising fuel prices as the under recovery of fuel costs impacts our cash flows  interest and leverage  and rising fuel costs and higher rates also impact customer satisfaction 
our efforts to mitigate these high fuel costs include our diverse generation mix  staggered fuel contracts and hedging  and supplier and transportation diversity 
we expect total capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental compliance for  and to be approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
subject to regulatory approval  applicable capital investments to support load growth and comply with environmental regulations increase the utilities rate base or investment in utility plant  upon which additional return can be realized  and create the basis for long term earnings growth in the utilities 
we expect to fund our business plans and new generation through operating cash flows and a combination of long term debt  preferred stock and common equity  all of which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may also pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
our synthetic fuels operations have historically provided significant net earnings driven by the section k tax credit program  which expired at the end of in accordance with our decision to permanently cease production of synthetic fuels  we abandoned our majority owned facilities in the fourth quarter of the operations of our synthetic fuels businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in however  the associated cash flow benefits from synthetic fuels are expected to come in the future when deferred section k tax credits generated through december   but not yet utilized  are ultimately utilized 
at december   the amount of these deferred tax credits carried forward was million 
see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits below  note d and item a  risk factors for additional information on our synthetic fuels tax credits and other matters 
as discussed more fully in note and results of operations discontinued operations  in accordance with our business strategy to reduce our business risk and to focus on the core operations of the utilities  the majority of our nonregulated business operations have been divested or are in the process of being divested 
these operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
consequently  the composition of other continuing segments has been impacted by these divestitures 
the progress registrants are subject to various risks 
for a discussion of their current material risks  see item a  risk factors 
results of operations in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a summarized overview of our consolidated earnings  which is followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis by business segment 
overview for as compared to and as compared to for the year ended december   our net income was million or per share compared to million or per share for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to lower clean smokestacks act amortization expense at pec  lower interest expense at the parent due to reducing debt in late  the cost incurred to redeem debt at the parent in  favorable weather at pec  lower allocations of corporate overhead to continuing operations as a result of the divestitures  unrealized losses recorded on contingent value obligations cvos during  favorable allowance for funds used during construction afudc equity at the utilities  favorable growth and usage at the utilities  and higher wholesale sales at pef 
partially offsetting these items were higher o m expenses at the utilities primarily due to higher outage and maintenance costs and higher employee benefits  additional depreciation expense associated with pec s accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generation assets see note b  higher interest expense at pef  the impact of the gain on sale of level communications  inc level stock acquired as part of the divestiture of progress telecom  llc pt llc  and higher other operating expenses due to disallowed fuel costs at pef 
for the year ended december   our net income was million or per share compared to million or per share for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to prior year postretirement and severance expenses related to the cost management initiative  increased retail growth and usage at the utilities  the gain on sale of level stock acquired as part of the divestiture of pt llc  and the prior year write off of unrecoverable storm costs at pef 
partially offsetting these items were unfavorable weather at the utilities  the cost incurred to redeem debt at the parent  unrealized losses recorded on cvos  increased nuclear outage expenses at pec  and the prior year gain on the sale of pef s utility distribution assets serving the city of winter park  fla 
winter park 
our segments contributed the following profit or loss from continuing operations in millions change change pec pef total segment profit corporate and other total income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income cost management initiative on february   we approved a workforce restructuring that resulted in a reduction of approximately positions 
in addition to the workforce restructuring  the cost management initiative included a voluntary enhanced retirement program 
in connection with this initiative  we incurred approximately million of pre tax charges for severance and postretirement benefits during the year ended december   of which million has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
we did not incur similar charges during or the severance and postretirement charges are primarily included in o m expense on the consolidated statements of income and will be paid over time 
progress energy carolinas pec contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in profits for as compared to is primarily due to lower clean smokestacks act amortization  the favorable impact of weather and favorable retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by higher o m expenses related to plant outage and maintenance costs and employee benefit costs and additional depreciation expense associated with pec s accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets 
the decrease in profits for as compared to is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather  higher o m expense related to nuclear outages  the impact of suspending the allocation of the parent s income tax benefit not related to acquisition interest expense and capital project write offs 
see corporate and other below for additional information on the change in the tax benefit allocation in these were partially offset by postretirement and severance expenses incurred in and favorable retail customer growth and usage 
the revenue tables below present the total amount and percentage change of revenues excluding fuel 
revenues excluding fuel is defined as total electric revenues less fuel revenues 
we and pec consider revenues excluding fuel a useful measure to evaluate pec s electric operations because fuel revenues primarily represent the recovery of fuel and a portion of purchased power expenses through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  do not have a material impact on earnings 
we and pec have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  revenues excluding fuel is not defined under gaap  and the presentation may not be comparable to other companies presentation or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report 
revenues pec s electric revenues and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues less fuel revenues revenues excluding fuel pec s electric energy sales and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail energy sales wholesale unbilled total mwh sales pec s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to the million favorable impact of weather and a million favorable impact of retail customer growth and usage 
weather had a favorable impact as cooling degree days were percent higher than cooling degree days were percent higher than normal 
the favorable retail customer growth and usage was driven by an approximate increase in the average number of customers of  as of december   compared to december  industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to primarily due to continued reduction in textile manufacturing in the carolinas as a result of global competition and domestic consolidation as well as a downturn in the lumber and building materials segment as a result of declines in residential construction 
the increase in industrial revenues for compared to is due to an increase in fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs and the recovery of prior year fuel costs 
pec s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  decreased million 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to the million unfavorable impact of weather partially offset by a million favorable impact of retail customer growth and usage 
weather had an unfavorable impact as cooling degree days were percent below and heating degree days were percent below the increase in retail customer growth and usage was driven by an approximate increase in the average number of customers of  as of december   compared to december  although the change in wholesale revenue less fuel did not have a material impact on the change in revenues  wholesale electric energy sales were down percent primarily due to lower excess generation sales in compared to  partially offset by an increase in contracted wholesale capacity 
the decrease in excess generation sales in compared to is due to favorable market conditions during that resulted in strong sales to the mid atlantic united states 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to primarily due to continued reduction in textile manufacturing in the carolinas as a result of global competition and domestic consolidation 
the increase in industrial revenues for compared to is due to an increase in fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs and the recovery of prior year fuel costs 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and a portion of purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion compared to this increase is primarily due to a million increase in fuel used in generation and a million increase in deferred fuel expense 
fuel used in generation increased primarily due to a change in generation mix as the percentage of generation supplied by natural gas increased in response to plant outages and higher system requirements driven by favorable weather 
deferred fuel expense increased primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
see electric pec fuel and purchased power in item  business for a summary of average fuel costs 
purchased power expenses decreased million to million compared to prior year 
the decrease in purchased power is due to lower cogeneration as a result of contract changes with one of pec s co generators 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion compared to this increase is due to a million increase in deferred fuel expense partially offset by a million decrease in fuel used in generation 
deferred fuel expense increased primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
fuel used in generation decreased primarily due to lower system requirements 
purchased power expenses decreased million to million compared to prior year 
the decrease in purchased power is due primarily to a change in volume as a result of lower system requirements 
operation and maintenance o m expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is driven primarily by the million higher plant outage and maintenance costs partially due to three nuclear outages in the current year compared to only two in the prior year and million due to higher employee benefit costs 
the higher employee benefit costs are primarily due to current year changes in equity compensation plans and higher relative employee incentive goal achievement in compared to we do not expect the increase related to changes in equity compensation plans to continue in o m expenses were million for  which represents an million decrease compared to this decrease is driven primarily by the million impact of postretirement and severance expenses incurred in related to the cost management initiative partially offset by million of higher outage expenses at nuclear plants and capital project write offs of million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the clean smokestacks act amortization  partially offset by million additional depreciation associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets see note b  million charge to reduce pec s gridsouth transco  llc gridsouth regional transmission organization rto development costs see note d and the million impact of depreciable asset base increases 
we recorded million of clean smokestacks act amortization during compared to million in see note b 
we recorded million of additional depreciation associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets during compared to none in depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the million impact of depreciable asset base increases and million of deferred environmental cost amortization partially offset by a million decrease in the clean smokestacks act amortization 
we recorded million of clean smokestacks act amortization during compared to million in taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to is primarily due to a million increase in property taxes and a million increase in gross receipts taxes related to higher revenue 
gross receipts taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings 
other other operating expenses consisted of gains of million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to land sales 
there were no gains from land sales in total other income expense total other income expense was million of income for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of million of indemnification liability expenses incurred in for estimated capital costs associated with the clean smokestacks act expected to be incurred in excess of the maximum billable costs to the joint owner 
this expense was reclassified to clean smokestacks act amortization and had no impact on earnings see note b 
this decrease is partially offset by million favorable afudc equity related to costs associated with certain large construction projects 
total other income expense was million of income for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is primarily due to the million impact of reclassifying million of indemnification liability expenses incurred in for estimated capital costs associated with the clean smokestacks act expected to be incurred in excess of the maximum billable costs to the joint owner 
this expense was reclassified to clean smokestacks act amortization and had no impact on earnings see note b 
interest income increased million for compared to primarily due to investment interest and interest on under recovered fuel costs 
in addition  the change in other income expense includes a million favorable impact related to recording an audit settlement with the ferc in total interest charges  net total interest charges  net were million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease is primarily due to the million impact of a decrease in average long term debt and million favorable afudc debt related to costs associated with certain large construction projects  partially offset by million higher interest related to higher variable rates on pollution control obligations

income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to is primarily due to the impact of higher pre tax income 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to is primarily due to the allocation of million of the parent s tax benefit not related to acquisition interest expense in that was suspended in see corporate and other below for additional information on the change in the tax benefit allocation in progress energy florida pef contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in profits for as compared to is primarily due to higher o m expenses related to plant outage and maintenance costs and employee benefit costs  higher interest expense  higher other operating expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense excluding recoverable storm amortization  partially offset by favorable afudc and higher wholesale sales 
the increase in profits for as compared to is primarily due to the impact of postretirement and severance costs incurred in  favorable retail customer growth and usage  an increase in rental and other miscellaneous service revenues and the impact of the write off of unrecoverable storm costs 
these were partially offset by the gain on the sale of the utility distribution assets serving winter park  the unfavorable impact of weather on revenues and the impact of suspending the allocation of the parent s tax benefit not related to acquisition interest expense 
see corporate and other below for additional information on the change in the tax benefit allocation in the revenue tables below present the total amount and percentage change of revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues 
revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues is defined as total electric revenues less fuel and other pass through revenues 
we and pef consider revenues excluding fuel and other pass through revenues a useful measure to evaluate pef s electric operations because fuel and other pass through revenues primarily represent the recovery of fuel  purchased power and other pass through expenses through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  do not have a material impact on earnings

the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents a million increase compared to purchased power expense increased million to million compared to this increase is primarily due to a million increase in current year purchased power costs partially offset by a million decrease in the recovery of deferred capacity costs 
the increased current year purchased power costs are a result of higher interchange purchases of million and higher capacity costs of million primarily due to new contracts 
fuel used in electric generation decreased million to billion due to a million decrease in deferred fuel expense partially offset by a million increase in current year fuel costs due primarily to an increase in oil and natural gas prices 
deferred fuel expenses were higher in primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
see electric pef fuel and purchased power in item  business for a summary of average fuel costs 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million due to a million increase in deferred fuel expense resulting from an increase in the fuel recovery rates on january   as a result of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in current year fuel costs due primarily to lower system requirements 
purchased power expense increased million primarily due to a million increase in current year purchased power costs resulting from higher market prices and a million increase in the recovery of deferred capacity costs 
operation and maintenance o m expenses were million in  which represents a million increase compared to the increase is primarily due to million related to an increase in storm damage reserves from the one year extension of the storm surcharge  which began august see note c and million related to higher environmental cost recovery ecrc and energy conservation cost recovery eccr costs 
additionally  the increase is due to million higher plant outage and maintenance costs and million higher employee benefit costs 
the higher employee benefit costs are primarily due to current year changes in equity compensation plans and higher relative employee incentive goal achievement in compared to we do not expect the increase related to changes in equity compensation plans to continue in the ecrc  eccr and storm damage reserve expenses are recovered through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  have no material impact on earnings 
o m expenses were million in  which represents a million decrease compared to the decrease is primarily due to a million impact of postretirement and severance costs in  million of lower ecrc expenses due to a decrease in emission allowances and lower recovery rates  million related to the write off of unrecoverable storm restoration costs see note c  a million decrease in nuclear outage costs and the million impact related to the write off of gridflorida rto startup costs that were previously recovered in revenues 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents a decrease of million compared to  primarily due to million lower amortization of storm restoration costs and million lower software and franchise amortization  partially offset by the million impact primarily related to depreciable asset base increases and a million write off of leasehold improvements  primarily related to vacated office space 
storm restoration costs  which were fully amortized in  were recovered through the storm recovery surcharge and  therefore  have no material impact on earnings see note c 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents an increase of million compared to  primarily due to a million increase in the amortization of storm restoration costs and a million increase in utility plant depreciation partially offset by a million decrease in expenses related to cost of removal primarily due to rate changes resulting from the depreciation study effective january  see note d 
as noted above  storm restoration cost amortization has no material impact on earnings 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million for and  and million for the million increase in compared to is primarily due to million of higher gross receipts taxes and million of higher franchise taxes  related to an increase in revenues  partially offset by lower payroll taxes 
gross receipts and franchise taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings 
other other operating expenses were million in compared to a gain of million in the million difference is primarily due to the million impact of a florida public service commission fpsc order requiring pef to refund disallowed fuel costs to its ratepayers see note c

progress energy recorded unrealized losses of million and million for and  respectively  and unrealized gains of million for  to record the changes in fair value of the cvos  which had average unit prices of  and at december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  income tax expense was not increased by the allocation of the parent s income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense to profitable subsidiaries 
due to the repeal of the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca  beginning in we no longer allocate the parent income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense to profitable subsidiaries 
since  parent income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense were allocated to profitable subsidiaries  in accordance with a puhca order 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was increased by million due to the allocation of the parent s income tax benefit 
other income tax benefit decreased for compared to primarily due to decreased pre tax expense at the parent primarily as a result of the loss on early retirement of debt in  partially offset by the million impact related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions see note  the million impact of taxes on interest allocated to discontinued operations and the million impact related to the deduction for domestic production activities 
other income tax benefit increased for compared to primarily due to increased pre tax expense at the parent and the million impact of taxes on interest allocated to discontinued operations 
for  other expense was million compared to million in the million decrease is primarily due to the million pre tax loss on redemptions of debt at the parent in see note and the million decrease in the allocation of corporate overhead as a result of the divestitures completed during these decreases are partially offset by the million pre tax gain  net of minority interest  on the sale of level stock subsequent to the sale of pt llc in see note e and the million increase in interest income on temporary investments due to proceeds from the sale of nonregulated businesses 
the million increase in other expense from to was primarily due to the million pre tax loss on redemptions of debt at the parent partially offset by the million pre tax gain  net of minority interest  on the sale of level stock subsequent to the sale of pt llc 
in addition  other expense changed due to a million increase in interest income on temporary investments due to proceeds from the sale of desoto county generating co  llc desoto  rowan county power  llc rowan and our natural gas drilling and production business gas 
discontinued operations over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting the majority of our nonregulated businesses to focus on the core operations of the utilities 
we divested  or announced divestitures  of multiple nonregulated businesses during and consequently  the composition of other continuing segments has been impacted by these divestitures 
cco operations cco georgia operations on march   our subsidiary progress ventures  inc pvi  entered into a series of transactions to sell or assign substantially all of its competitive commercial operations cco physical and commercial assets and liabilities 
assets divested include approximately  mw of gas fired generation assets in georgia 
the sale of the generation assets closed on june   for a net sales price of million 
we recorded an estimated loss of million in december based on the terms of the final agreement and post closing adjustments  during the year ended december   we reversed million after tax of the impairment recorded in see note a 
additionally  on june   pvi closed the transaction involving the assignment of a contract portfolio consisting of full requirements contracts with georgia electric membership cooperatives formerly serviced by cco the georgia contracts  forward gas and power contracts  gas transportation  structured power and other contracts to a third party 
this represents substantially all of our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations 
as a result of the assignments  pvi made a net cash payment of million  which represents the net cost to assign the georgia contracts and other related contracts 
in the year ended december   we recorded a charge associated with the costs to exit the georgia contracts  and other related contracts  of million after tax 
we used the net proceeds from these transactions for general corporate purposes 
cco s operations generated net losses from discontinued operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net losses from discontinued operations in primarily represent the million after tax charge associated with exit costs  partially offset by unrealized mark to market gains related to dedesignated natural gas hedges 
these hedges were dedesignated because management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts covering approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas would be fulfilled 
therefore  cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued 
the increase in loss for compared to is primarily due to the million pre tax impairment loss million after tax on goodwill recognized in the first quarter of see note and an increase in realized mark to market losses on gas hedges due to gas price volatility 
this was partially offset by a higher gross margin related to serving the fixed price full requirements contracts that began in april and serving an increased load on a pre existing contract in georgia  and million pre tax of unrealized mark to market gains related to the dedesignated natural gas hedges 
cco desoto and rowan generation facilities on may   our board of directors approved a plan to divest of two subsidiaries of pvi  desoto and rowan 
desoto owned a mw dual fuel combustion turbine electric generation facility in desoto county  fla  and rowan owned a mw dual fuel combined cycle and combustion turbine electric generation facility in rowan county  nc on may   we entered into definitive agreements to sell desoto and rowan  including certain existing power supply contracts  to southern power company  a subsidiary of southern company  for a gross purchase price of approximately million and million  respectively 
we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes see note d 
the sale of desoto closed in the second quarter of and the sale of rowan closed during the third quarter of based on the gross proceeds associated with the sales  we recorded an after tax loss on disposal of million during the year ended december  desoto and rowan operations generated combined net earnings from discontinued operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
terminals operations and synthetic fuels businesses on december   we signed an agreement to sell coal terminals and docks in west virginia and kentucky terminals for million in gross cash proceeds 
terminals was previously reported as a component of our former coal and synthetic fuels operating segment 
the terminals have a total annual capacity in excess of million tons for transloading  blending and storing coal and other commodities 
proceeds from the sale are expected to be used for general corporate purposes see note b 
historically  we have had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits under section k so long as certain requirements were satisfied see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
on september   we idled production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned fuels facilities due to the high level of oil prices 
on october   based upon the continued high level of oil prices  unfavorable oil price projections through the end of and the expiration of the synthetic fuels tax credit program at the end of  we permanently ceased production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned facilities 
as a result of the expiration of the tax credit program  all of our synthetic fuels businesses were abandoned and all operations ceased as of december  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  a long lived asset is abandoned when it ceases to be used 
all periods have been restated to reflect the abandoned operations of our synthetic fuels businesses as discontinued operations 
terminals and synthetic fuels businesses generated net earnings from discontinued operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net losses from discontinued operations for terminals and synthetic fuels businesses were million for the year ended december  the change in net loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   to net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   is primarily due to increased tax credits generated due to higher production of coal based solid synthetic fuels  unrealized mark to market gain on derivative contracts in and the impairment of synthetic fuels assets recorded in these favorable items are partially offset by an increase in the tax credit reserve due to the increase in production and the change in the relative oil prices  which indicated a higher estimated phase out of tax credits  and lower margins due to the increase in coal based solid synthetic fuels production 
the change in net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   to net loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   is primarily due to lower synthetic fuels production as a result of high oil prices  which increased the potential phase out of tax credits and the impairment of synthetic fuels assets recorded in gas operations on october   we sold gas to exco resources  inc for approximately billion in net proceeds 
gas included winchester production company  ltd 
winchester production  westchester gas company  texas gas gathering and talco midstream assets ltd  all were subsidiaries of progress fuels 
proceeds from the sale have been used primarily to reduce holding company debt and for other corporate purposes see note c 
based on the net proceeds associated with the sale  we recorded an after tax net gain on disposal of million during the year ended december  we recorded an after tax loss of million during the year ended december   primarily related to working capital adjustments 
gas operations generated net earnings from discontinued operations of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net earnings from discontinued operations during is primarily due to increased production  higher market prices and mark to market gains on gas hedges 
progress telecom  llc on march   we completed the sale of pt llc to level we received gross proceeds comprised of cash of million and approximately million shares of level common stock valued at an estimated million on the date of the sale 
our net proceeds from the sale of million  after consideration of minority interest  were used to reduce debt 
prior to the sale  we had a percent interest in pt llc see note e 
see note for a discussion of the subsequent sale of the level stock in based on the net proceeds associated with the sale and after consideration of minority interest  we recorded an after tax gain on disposal of million during the year ended december  net loss earnings from discontinued operations for pt llc were a loss of million and earnings of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dixie fuels and other fuels business on march   we sold progress fuels percent interest in dixie fuels limited dixie fuels to kirby corporation for million in cash 
dixie fuels operates a fleet of four ocean going dry bulk barge and tugboat units 
dixie fuels primarily transports coal from the lower mississippi river to progress energy s crystal river facility 
we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale of dixie fuels during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded an additional gain of million primarily related to the expiration of indemnifications see note f 
net earnings from discontinued operations for dixie fuels and other fuels business were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coal mining businesses progress fuels owned five subsidiaries engaged in the coal mining business 
these businesses were previously included in our former coal and synthetic fuels business segment 
on may   we sold certain net assets of three of our coal mining businesses to alpha natural resources  llc for gross proceeds of million plus a million working capital adjustment 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded an estimated after tax loss of million for the sale of these assets see note g 
on december   we signed an agreement to sell the remaining net assets of the coal mining business for gross cash proceeds of million 
these assets include powell mountain coal co 
and dulcimer land co  which consist of about  acres in lee county  va  and harlan county  ky 
the property contains an estimated million tons of high quality coal reserves 
net losses from discontinued operations for the coal mining business were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
progress rail on march   we completed the sale of progress rail services corporation progress rail to one equity partners llc  a private equity firm unit of jp morgan chase co 
cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million  consisting of million base proceeds plus a working capital adjustment 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an estimated after tax loss for the sale of these assets of million and million  respectively 
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt see note h 
net earnings from discontinued operations for progress rail were million for the year ended december  application of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  we made certain estimates that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on our financial results and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit and corporate performance committee audit committee of our board of directors 
utility regulation as discussed in note  our regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates we are permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the different ratemaking processes in each state in which we operate  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
we continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies ratemaking processes often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
see note for additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on our operations 
asset impairments as discussed in note  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist 
examples of these indicators include current period losses combined with a history of losses  a projection of continuing losses  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group  or the likelihood that an asset group will be disposed of significantly prior to the end of its useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
performing an impairment test on long lived assets involves management s judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances indicating an impairment may exist  identifying and grouping affected assets at the appropriate level  and developing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group 
estimates of future cash flows contemplate factors such as expected use of the assets  future production and sales levels  and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed 
therefore  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
the carrying value of our total utility plant  net is billion at december  the carrying value of our total diversified business property  net is million at december  in addition  we have certain diversified business property with a carrying value of million at december   included in net assets to be divested see note i 
our exposure to potential impairment losses for utility plant  net is mitigated by the fact that our regulated ratemaking process generally allows for recovery of our investment in utility plant plus an allowed return on the investment  as long as the costs are prudently incurred 
under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of discounted at future net revenues using current prices  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the ceiling test takes into consideration the prices of qualifying cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date 
if the ceiling discounted revenues does not exceed total capitalized costs  we are required to write down capitalized costs to the ceiling 
we performed this ceiling test calculation every quarter prior to the sale of the gas operations see note c 
no write downs were required in or see discussion of synthetic fuels asset impairments in other matters synthetic fuels tax credits and in notes and goodwill as discussed in note  we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
for our utility segments  the goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility operating segment level 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test for both the pec and pef segments in the second quarters of and  each of which indicated no impairment 
if the fair values for the utility segments were lower by percent  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec and pef  were billion and billion  respectively 
the amounts assigned to pec and pef are recorded in our corporate and other business segment 
we calculated the fair value of our segments and reporting units by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology and published industry valuations and market data as supporting information 
these calculations are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in management s estimate of future cash flows and the discount rates  growth rates or the timing of market equilibrium  could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
synthetic fuels tax credits our former coal and synthetic fuels segment was previously involved in the production and sale of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under the internal revenue code see note b 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuels from these facilities qualified for tax credits under section k if certain requirements were satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differ significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the synthetic fuels were produced from a facility placed in service before july  for and prior years  the amount of section credits that we were allowed to generate in any calendar year was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized through december   are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits on the consolidated balance sheets 
for and  in accordance with federal legislation  the section tax credits have been redesignated as a section k general business credit  which removes the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a year carry forward period 
this provision allowed us to produce synthetic fuels at a higher level than we have historically produced  had we chosen to do so 
the synthetic fuels tax credit program expired at the end of in addition  section k provided that if the average wellhead price per barrel for unregulated domestic crude oil for the year the annual average price exceeded a certain threshold value the threshold price  the amount of tax credits was reduced for that year 
also  if the annual average price increased high enough the phase out price  the section k tax credits were eliminated for that year 
the threshold price and the phase out price were adjusted annually for inflation 
we estimate that the annual average price will result in an approximate percent phase out of the synthetic fuels tax credits related to synthetic fuels production in this estimate is derived from our estimates of the threshold price and phase out price of per barrel and per barrel  respectively  based on an estimated inflation adjustment for for synthetic fuels production  the annual average price is not known until after the end of the year 
we recorded the tax credits based on our estimates of what we believe the annual average price will be for any portion of the tax credits that were phased out based on the projected annual average price exceeding the threshold price was not recorded 
see further discussion in other matters synthetic fuels tax credits and item a  risk factors 
pension costs as discussed in note a  we maintain qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
our reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to an increase in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate used to present value future benefit payments  we increased the discount rate to approximately at december   from approximately at december   which will decrease the benefit costs recognized  all other factors remaining constant 
our discount rates are selected based on a plan by plan study  which matches our projected benefit payments to a high quality corporate yield curve 
plan assets performed well in  with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  contributions to pension plan assets in and will result in decreased pension costs in due to increased asset returns  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors on our pension costs have not been completed  but we estimate that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in we have pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  our expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
we review this rate on a regular basis 
under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  we do not adjust that rate of return frequently 
in  we elected to lower our expected rate of return from to 
the rate of return represents the lower end of our future expected return range given our asset allocation policy 
a change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
another factor affecting our pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is the method selected to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
sfas no 
specifies that entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
we have historically used a five year averaging method 
when we acquired florida progress in  we retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are subject to each of the two methods 
liquidity and capital resources overview progress energy  inc is a holding company and  as such  has no revenue generating operations of its own 
our primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend and interest and principal payments on our billion of senior unsecured debt 
our ability to meet these needs is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the utilities  and the ability of the utilities to pay dividends or repay funds to us 
as discussed under future liquidity and capital resources below  synthetic fuels tax credits provide an additional source of liquidity as those credits are realized 
our other significant cash requirements arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of the utilities operations  including expenditures for environmental compliance 
we rely upon our operating cash flow  primarily generated by the utilities  commercial paper and bank facilities  and our ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
the majority of our operating costs are related to the utilities 
most of these costs are recovered from ratepayers in accordance with various rate plans 
we are allowed to recover certain fuel  purchased power and other costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective recovery clauses 
the types of costs recovered through clauses vary by jurisdiction 
fuel price volatility can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel prices are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility can be both a source of and a use of liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility we are experiencing 
changes in the utilities fuel and purchased power costs may affect the timing of cash flows  but not materially affect net income 
effective february   the energy policy act of epact provisions enacted the public utility holding company act of puhca 
progress energy is a registered public utility holding company subject to regulation by the ferc under puhca  including provisions relating to the issuance and sale of securities and the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit utility and nonutility money pools 
pec and pef participate in the utility money pool  which allows the two utilities to lend to and borrow from each other 
a nonutility money pool allows our nonregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each other 
the parent can lend money to the utility and nonutility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
pursuant to puhca  utility holding companies are allowed to continue to engage in financings authorized by the sec  provided the authorization orders have been filed with the ferc and the holding company continues to comply with such orders  terms and conditions 
we have filed all such sec orders with the ferc  therefore  we are permitted to continue all such financing transactions 
cash from operations  asset sales  short term and long term debt and limited ongoing equity sales from our investor plus stock purchase plan and employee benefit and stock option plans are expected to fund capital expenditures and common stock dividends for for the fiscal year  we expect to realize an aggregate amount of approximately million from the sale of stock through these plans 
we believe our internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund our current business plans 
risk factors associated with credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
cash from operating activities for decreased when compared with the million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to million in income tax impacts  largely driven by income tax payments related to the sale of gas  the million payment made to exit the georgia contracts see note a  a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs  and million in premiums paid for derivative contracts in our synthetic fuels businesses 
these impacts were partially offset by a million decrease in inventory purchases in  primarily related to coal purchases at the utilities  million of working capital changes related to the divestiture of cco  and million in net refunds of cash collateral previously paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in the current year compared to million in net cash payments in the prior year at pef 
the decrease in recovery of fuel costs is due to a million decrease at pef driven by the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs  partially offset by a million increase in the recovery at pec driven by the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs 
cash from operating activities for increased when compared with the million increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in the recovery of fuel costs at the utilities  a million increase from the change in accounts receivable  approximately million of proceeds received from the restructuring of a long term coal supply contract at our discontinued terminals operations  and million related to recovery of storm restoration costs at pef 
these impacts were partially offset by million related to a wholesale customer prepayment in at pec  as discussed below  a million decrease from the change in accounts payable and a million net increase in tax payments in compared to the increase in recovery of fuel costs was largely driven by the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs 
the million change in accounts receivable included million at pec  principally driven by the timing of wholesale sales  and million at pef  primarily related to timing of receipts 
the million decrease from the change in accounts payable was primarily related to our discontinued and abandoned operations see note 
in november  pec entered into a contract with the public works commission of the city of fayetteville  north carolina pwc  in which the pwc prepaid million in exchange for future capacity and energy power sales 
the prepayment covered approximately two years of electricity service and included a prepayment discount of approximately million 
in and  the utilities filed requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases for fuel cost recovery  including amounts for previous under recoveries 
in  pef received approval from the fpsc authorizing pef to recover million over a two year period  including interest  of the costs it incurred and previously deferred related to pef s restoration of power to customers associated with the four hurricanes in see future liquidity and capital resources and note c for additional information 
investing activities net cash used provided by investing activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  million and billion  respectively 
property additions at the utilities  including nuclear fuel  were billion and billion in and  respectively  or approximately percent of consolidated capital expenditures for continuing operations in both and capital expenditures at the utilities are primarily for capacity expansion and normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and billion in  cash used in investing activities increased by million 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily at pef  and a million increase in nuclear fuel additions  partially offset by a decrease in property additions at our diversified businesses  most of which have been discontinued or abandoned 
at pec  utility property additions primarily related to an increase in spending for compliance with the clean smokestacks act 
at pef  the increase in utility property additions is primarily due to environmental compliance projects  repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology  which will not be completed until  and nuclear and transmission projects  partially offset by lower spending on energy system distribution projects and at the hines unit facility 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of billion in and million in  cash used in investing activities decreased by million in when compared with the decrease in was primarily due to a million increase in net proceeds from available for sale securities and other investments  a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions  and a million decrease in other investing activities  largely offset by a million increase in capital expenditures for utility property 
at pec  the increase in utility property was primarily due to environmental compliance and mobile meter reading project expenditures 
at pef  the increase in utility property was primarily due to repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology  which will not be completed until  various distribution  transmission and steam production projects  and higher spending at the hines unit facility  partially offset by lower spending at the hines unit facility 
the increase in utility property additions was partially offset by an million decrease related to diversified businesses  which have primarily been discontinued or abandoned 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt and equity securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning and benefit investment trusts

financing activities net cash provided used by financing activities for the three years ended december   and  was million  billion and million  respectively 
see note for details of debt and credit facilities 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities for compared to primarily related to the issuance of million in long term debt at pef and the billion reduction in holding company debt in  as discussed below 
for  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  were used to reduce holding company debt by billion 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for compared to was primarily related to the retirement of long term debt in  as discussed below  and a decrease in the proceeds from issuances of long term debt

future liquidity and capital resources please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and we anticipate that the utilities will continue to produce substantially all of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years 
our synthetic fuels businesses  whose operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations  have historically produced significant earnings from the generation of tax credits see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
these tax credits have yet to be realized in cash due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and realized for tax purposes 
as of december   we have carried forward million of deferred tax credits 
realization of these tax credits is dependent upon our future taxable income  which is expected to be generated primarily by the utilities 
with the exception of the anticipated proceeds in from the sale of our coal mining and terminals operations see notes b and g  the absence of cash flow resulting from divested businesses is not expected to impact our future liquidity or capital resources as these businesses in the aggregate have been largely cash flow neutral over the last several years 
cash from operations plus availability under our credit facilities and shelf registration statements is expected to be sufficient to meet our requirements in the near term 
to the extent necessary  we may also use limited ongoing equity sales from our investor plus stock purchase plan and employee benefit and stock option plans to meet our liquidity requirements 
we issue commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
in the latter half of  the short term credit markets tightened  resulting in higher interest rate spreads and shorter durations 
currently  the market has improved  however  there has been volatility on commercial paper spreads  as the supply of short term commercial paper has increased following recent actions by the federal open market committee 
if liquidity conditions deteriorate and negatively impact the commercial paper market  we will need to evaluate other  potentially more expensive  options for meeting our short term liquidity needs  which may include borrowing from our rcas  issuing short term floating rate notes  and or issuing long term debt 
progress energy has approximately billion in outstanding debt 
only million of our debt is insured 
these bonds are obligations of the utilities and are traded in the tax exempt auction rate securities market 
ambac assurance corporation insures approximately million of the bonds and xl capital assurance  inc insures the remaining million 
to date  auctions for the utilities bonds have seen an increase in the interest rates that are periodically reset at each auction 
since the downgrade of xl capital assurance  inc on february   by moody s investors service  inc moody s  we have seen additional market volatility and an increase in the reset interest rates for a portion of our tax exempt bonds 
if additional downgrades by moody s or standard poor s rating services s p occur  we could see additional volatility in this market and the potential for higher rate resets 
we will continue to monitor this market and evaluate options to mitigate our exposure to future volatility 
over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth at the utilities will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  potentially including new baseload generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas toward the end of the next decade 
this approach will require the utilities to make significant capital investments 
see introduction strategy for additional information 
these anticipated capital investments are expected to be funded through a combination of cash from operations and issuance of long term debt  preferred stock and common equity  which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
the amount and timing of future sales of securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow  asset sales and our specific needs 
we may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount immediately needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other corporate purposes 
at december   the current portion of our long term debt was million  which we expect to fund with a combination of cash from operations  proceeds from sales of assets  commercial paper borrowings and long term debt 
see note for additional information on asset sales 
regulatory matters and recovery of costs regulatory matters  as discussed in other matters regulatory environment and note  and filings for recovery of environmental costs  as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  may impact our future liquidity and financing activities 
the impacts of these matters  including the timing of recoveries from ratepayers  can be both a source of and a use of future liquidity resources 
pec base rates pec s base rates are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the north carolina utilities commission ncuc and the south carolina public service commission scpsc 
as further discussed in note b  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in the clean smokestacks act froze north carolina electric utility base rates for a five year period  which ended december   unless there were extraordinary events beyond the control of the utilities or unless the utilities persistently earned a return substantially in excess of the rate of return established and found reasonable by the ncuc in the respective utility s last general rate case 
there were no adjustments to pec s base rates during the five year period ended december  subsequent to  pec s current north carolina base rates are continuing subject to traditional cost based rate regulation 
on march   pec filed a petition with the ncuc requesting that it be allowed to amortize the remaining percent or million of the original estimated compliance costs for the clean smokestacks act during and  with discretion to amortize up to million in either year 
additionally  among other things  pec requested that the ncuc allow pec to include in its rate base those eligible compliance costs exceeding the original estimated compliance costs and that pec be allowed to accrue afudc on all eligible compliance costs in excess of the original estimated compliance costs 
pec also requested that any prudency review of pec s environmental compliance costs be deferred until pec s next ratemaking proceeding in which pec seeks to adjust its base rates 
on october   pec filed with the ncuc a settlement agreement with the ncuc public staff  the carolina utility customers associations cuca and the carolina industrial group for fair utility rates ii cigfur supporting pec s proposal 
the ncuc held a hearing on this matter on october  on december   the ncuc approved the settlement agreement on a provisional basis  with the ncuc indicating that it intended to initiate a review in to consider all reasonable alternatives and proposals related to pec s recovery of its clean smokestacks act compliance costs in excess of the original estimated costs of million 
additionally  the ncuc ordered that no portion of clean smokestacks act compliance costs directly assigned  allocated or otherwise attributable to another jurisdiction shall be recovered from pec s retail north carolina customers  even if recovery of these costs is disallowed or denied  in whole or in part  in another jurisdiction 
we cannot predict the outcome of pec s recovery of eligible compliance costs exceeding the original estimated compliance costs 
pec pass through clause cost recovery on may   pec filed with the scpsc for an increase in the fuel rate charged to its south carolina ratepayers 
on june   the scpsc approved a settlement agreement filed jointly by pec and all other parties to the proceedings 
the settlement agreement resolved all issues and provided for a million increase in fuel rates 
effective july   residential electric bills increased by per  kwh  or percent  for fuel cost recovery 
at december   pec s south carolina deferred fuel balance was million 
on june   pec filed with the ncuc for an increase in the fuel rate charged to its north carolina ratepayers 
pec asked the ncuc to approve a million increase in fuel rates 
on september   the ncuc approved pec s petition 
the increase took effect october   and increased residential electric bills by per  kwh  or percent  for fuel cost recovery 
this was the second increase associated with a three year settlement approved by the ncuc in the settlement provided for an increase of million effective october   million effective october   as discussed above  and an additional increase of approximately million in october on november   cuca filed an appeal with the north carolina tenth district court of appeals of the ncuc s order approving the settlement on the grounds that the ncuc did not have the statutory authority to establish fuel rates for more than one year 
on october   cuca filed a motion to withdraw their appeal 
on november   the north carolina tenth district court of appeals granted cuca s motion 
at december   pec s north carolina deferred fuel balance was million  of which million is expected to be collected after and has been classified as a long term regulatory asset 
as discussed further in other matters regulatory environment  south carolina and north carolina state energy legislation that became law in may impact our liquidity over the long term 
among other provisions  these state energy laws provide mechanisms for recovery of certain baseload generation construction costs and expand annual fuel clause mechanisms so that additional costs may be recovered annually 
comprehensive energy legislation enacted in in north carolina expanded the costs that may be recovered annually under the fuel clause  including costs of reagents used in emissions control technologies commodities such as ammonia and limestone  the avoided costs associated with renewable energy purchases and certain components of purchased power not previously recoverable through the fuel clause 
energy legislation enacted in in south carolina expanded the annual fuel clause mechanism to include recovery of the costs of reagents used in the operation of emissions control technologies 
we anticipate pec s reagent and purchased power costs eligible for jurisdictional recovery under the north carolina and south carolina energy laws will total approximately million in the north carolina law mandates minimum renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standards reps beginning in utilities are allowed to recover the premium to be paid to comply with the requirements above the cost they would have otherwise incurred to meet consumer demand 
the annual amount that can be recovered through the reps clause is capped and once a utility has expended monies equal to the cap  the utility is deemed to have met its obligation under the reps  regardless of the actual renewables generated or purchased 
the recovery cap requirement begins in and  as a result  pec will begin deferring certain costs associated with renewable energy purchases in these costs are expected to be immaterial in in addition  the north carolina law also allows pec to recover the costs of new dsm and energy efficiency programs through an annual dsm clause 
dsm programs include any program or initiative that shifts the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods 
pec has begun implementing a series of dsm and energy efficiency programs and for the year ended december   deferred million of implementation and program costs for future recovery

pef base rates as a result of a base rate proceeding in  pef is party to a base rate settlement agreement that was effective with the first billing cycle of january and will remain in effect through the last billing cycle of december  with pef having sole option to extend the agreement through the last billing cycle of june the settlement agreement also provides for revenue sharing between pef and its ratepayers beginning in whereby pef will refund two thirds of retail base revenues between a specified threshold and specified cap  which will be adjusted annually  and percent of revenues above the specified cap 
pef s retail base revenues did not exceed the specified or thresholds  and thus no revenues were subject to revenue sharing 
the settlement agreement provides for pef to continue to recover certain costs through clauses  such as the recovery of post security costs through the capacity clause and the carrying costs of coal inventory in transit and coal procurement costs through the fuel clause 
if pef s regulatory return on equity roe falls below percent  and for certain other events  pef is authorized to petition the fpsc for a base rate increase 
on october   the fpsc approved a stipulation and settlement agreement that settled all issues related to recovery of the revenue requirements of hines unit and hines unit and provided that pef shall increase its base rates for the revenue requirements of hines unit and hines unit and simplify the implementation of the base rate increase of million by making it effective with the first billing cycle in january the revenue requirements of hines unit were previously being recovered through the fuel clause 
pef pass through clause cost recovery on september   pef filed a request with the fpsc seeking approval of a cost adjustment to reflect a projected over collection of fuel costs in  declining projected fuel costs for  and other recovery clause factors 
pef asked the fpsc to approve a million  or percent  decrease in rates effective january  this cost adjustment would decrease residential bills by for the first  kwh 
as discussed above  residential base rates increased effective january   by for the first  kwh 
after considering the net effect of the base rate increase and the proposed fuel cost adjustment  residential bills would decrease by a net amount of for the first  kwh 
the fpsc approved the cost recovery rates for in an order dated january  at december   pef was over recovered in fuel and capacity costs by million  over recovered in conservation costs by million  over recovered in environmental compliance by million and had accrued disallowed fuel costs of million as discussed below 
on august   florida s office of public counsel opc filed a petition with the fpsc asking that the fpsc require pef to refund to ratepayers million  plus interest  of alleged excessive past fuel recovery charges and sulfur dioxide so allowance costs associated with pef s purported failure to utilize the most economical sources of coal at crystal river unit and crystal river unit cr and cr during the period to the opc subsequently revised its claim to million  plus interest 
on july   the fpsc heard this matter 
on october   the fpsc issued its order rejecting most of the opc s contentions 
however  the majority found that pef had not been prudent in purchasing a portion of its coal requirements during the period from to accordingly  the fpsc ordered pef to refund its ratepayers approximately million  inclusive of interest  over a month period beginning january  on october   the opc requested the fpsc to reconsider its october  order asserting that the fpsc erred in not ordering a larger refund 
pef filed its opposition to the opc s request on november  on february   the fpsc denied the opc s request for reconsideration 
pef is also evaluating its options  including an appeal to the florida supreme court of the fpsc s october  order 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the fpsc also ordered pef to address whether it was prudent in its and coal purchases for cr and cr on october   pef filed a motion to establish a separate docket on the prudence of its coal purchases for cr and cr for the years and on october   the fpsc granted that motion 
the opc filed testimony in support of its position to require pef to refund at least million for alleged excessive fuel recovery charges for coal purchases 
pef believes its coal procurement practices were prudent 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on september   pef filed a petition with the fpsc for determination of need to uprate crystal river unit no 
nuclear plant cr  bid rule exemption and recovery of the revenue requirements of the uprate through pef s fuel recovery clause 
to the extent the expenditures are prudently incurred  pef s investment in the cr uprate is eligible for recovery through base rates 
pef s petition would allow for more prompt recovery 
on february   the fpsc issued an order approving pef s request for a need determination to uprate through a multi stage uprate to be completed by pef s need determination filing included estimated project costs of approximately million 
on february   intervenors filed a motion to abate the cost recovery portion of pef s request 
on february   pef requested that the fpsc deny the intervenors motion as legally deficient and without merit 
on march   the fpsc denied the motion to abate and directed the staff of the fpsc to conduct a hearing on the matter to determine whether the revenue requirements of the uprate should be recovered through the fuel recovery clause 
on may   pef filed amended testimony clarifying the scope of the project 
the fpsc held a hearing on this matter on august and  the staff of the fpsc recommended that pef be allowed to recover prudent and reasonable costs of phase  instrumentation modifications for improved accuracy  estimated at million through the fuel clause 
the staff of the fpsc recommended that the costs of all other phases  estimated at million  be considered in a base rate proceeding 
on october   pef filed a notice of withdrawal of its cost recovery petition with the fpsc 
on november   pef filed a petition with the fpsc seeking cost recovery under florida s comprehensive energy bill enacted in  and the fpsc s new nuclear cost recovery rule 
on february   pef filed a notice of withdrawal of its cost recovery petition with the fpsc 
pef will proceed with cost recovery under florida s comprehensive energy bill and the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule based on the regulatory precedence established by a fpsc order to an unaffiliated florida utility for a nuclear uprate project 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef has received approval from the fpsc for recovery of costs associated with the remediation of distribution and substation transformers through the ecrc  which were estimated to be million at december  additionally  on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for its integrated strategy to address compliance with cair  camr and cavr through the ecrc see other matters environmental matters for discussion regarding camr 
the fpsc also approved cost recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy  which are currently estimated to be billion to billion 
storm cost recovery on august   the fpsc approved a settlement agreement related to pef s storm cost recovery docket that allowed pef to extend its then current two year storm surcharge 
the requested month extension  which began in august  will replenish the existing storm reserve by an estimated million 
in the event future storms deplete the reserve  pef would be able to petition the fpsc for implementation of an interim surcharge of at least percent and up to percent of the claimed deficiency of its storm reserve 
intervenors agreed not to oppose the interim recovery of percent of the future claimed deficiency but reserved the right to challenge the interim surcharge recovery of the remaining percent 
the fpsc has the right to review pef s storm costs for prudence 
nuclear cost recovery the fpsc approved new rules on february   that allow pef to recover prudently incurred siting  preconstruction costs and afudc on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned once the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
such amounts will not be included in pef s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
other regulatory matters additionally  on july   the governor of florida issued executive orders to address reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
the fpsc has held meetings regarding the renewable portfolio standard but no actions have been taken or rules issued 
the energy and climate action team appointed by the governor submitted its initial recommendations for implementation of the governor s executive orders on november  the recommendations encourage the development and implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures  implementation of a climate registry  and consideration of a cap and trade approach to reducing the state s greenhouse gas emissions 
additional development and discussion of the recommendations will occur through a stakeholder process in the florida department of environmental protection held its first rulemaking workshop on the greenhouse gas emissions cap on august   and a second workshop on december  we anticipate drafts of the rule will be issued in we cannot currently predict the costs of complying with the laws and regulations that may ultimately result from these executive orders 
our balanced solution  as described in increasing energy demand  includes greater investment in energy efficiency  renewable energy and state of the art generation and demonstrates our commitment to environmental responsibility 
in addition  the florida energy commission  which was established by the legislature in  published its energy policy and climate change recommendations on december  the report includes proposed legislative language that would implement energy efficiency and conservation programs  participation in the multi state climate registry  and emissions reduction targets that are similar to those contained in the governor s executive orders 
we cannot currently predict the impacts to our liquidity of complying with these executive orders and the florida energy commission s recommendations 
epact  among other provisions  gave the ferc accountability for system reliability and the authority to impose civil penalties 
on june   compliance with ferc approved reliability standards became mandatory for all registered users  owners and operators of the bulk power system  including pec and pef 
on december   the ferc approved three additional planning and operating reliability standards 
additionally  on january   the ferc approved eight mandatory critical infrastructure protection reliability standards to protect the bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber security breaches 
based on ferc s directive to revise of the adopted standards  we expect standards to migrate to more definitive and enforceable requirements over time 
we are committed to meeting those standards 
the financial impact of mandatory compliance cannot currently be determined 
failure to comply with the reliability standards could result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties 
if we are unable to meet the reliability standards for the bulk power system in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
capital expenditures total cash from operations and proceeds from long term debt issuances provided the funding for our capital expenditures  including environmental compliance and other utility property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and non utility property additions during as shown in the table below  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be incurred at our regulated operations 
we expect to fund our capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or common equity 
in addition  we have billion in credit facilities that support the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market provides additional liquidity to help meet working capital requirements 
we anticipate our regulated capital expenditures will increase in and  primarily due to increased spending on environmental initiatives and current growth and maintenance projects 
afudc borrowed funds represents the debt costs of capital funds necessary to finance the construction of new regulated plant assets 
actual forecasted in millions regulated capital expenditures nuclear fuel expenditures afudc borrowed funds other capital expenditures total before potential nuclear construction potential nuclear construction a total a expenditures for potential nuclear construction are net of afudc borrowed funds and include land  development  licensing  equipment and associated transmission 
forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  final contract negotiations  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages  if any  of joint ownership 
these expenditures  which are primarily at pef  are subject to cost recovery provisions in the utilities respective jurisdictions see discussion under other matters nuclear 
regulated capital expenditures for  and in the table above include approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmental compliance capital expenditures 
forecasted environmental compliance capital expenditures for  and include million  million and million  respectively  at pec and million  million and million  respectively  at pef 
we currently estimate that total future capital expenditures for the utilities to comply with current environmental laws and regulations addressing air and water quality  which are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses  could be in excess of million at pec and in excess of billion at pef through  which is the latest compliance target date for current air and water quality regulations 
see other matters environmental matters for further discussion of our environmental compliance costs and related recovery of costs 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends

these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies  and no assurances can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  we monitor our financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect our credit ratings 
on september   s p upgraded the first mortgage bonds of both pec and pef to a from bbb as a result of a methodology change for collateral coverage requirements 
because both pec and pef had asset to potential secured debt ratios of less than  they were assigned a recovery rating of  which qualified for a one notch increase over their corporate credit ratings 
on july   fitch ratings upgraded the long term ratings of both pec and pef to a from bbb and revised their rating outlooks to stable from positive 
fitch ratings cited cash flow coverage and leverage credit ratios more consistent with the a rating category at the utilities  sound utility operations and operations in historically favorable regulatory environments as the primary factors for the upgrades 
fitch ratings also noted lowered group linkage risks for pec and pef resulting from improved business risk at the parent due to the sale or wind down of non utility operations and reduced debt 
on june   moody s upgraded the corporate credit rating for pec to a from baa and revised its outlook to stable from positive 
moody s cited strong cash flow coverage measures and financial metrics  operations in constructive regulatory environments with growing service territories and lower debt and business risk at the parent as the primary factors in the upgrade 
on march   s p upgraded corporate credit ratings to bbb from bbb at progress energy  inc  pec and pef and revised each company s outlook to stable from positive 
s p cited the significant reduction in our holding company debt and the moderation of business risk achieved by our renewed focus on our regulated utilities as the primary factors in the upgrade 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations are described below 
guarantees as a part of normal business  we enter into various agreements providing future financial or performance assurances to third parties that are outside the scope of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to progress energy or our subsidiaries on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
our guarantees include standby letters of credit  surety bonds  performance obligations for trading operations and guarantees of certain subsidiary credit obligations 
at december   we have issued million of guarantees for future financial or performance assurance  including million at pec and million at pef 
included in this amount is million of guarantees of certain payments of two wholly owned indirect subsidiaries issued by the parent see note 
we do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under the guarantees of performance issued by or on behalf of affiliates 
at december   we have issued guarantees and indemnifications of certain asset performance  legal  tax and environmental matters to third parties  including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses  and for timely payment of obligations in support of our nonwholly owned synthetic fuels operations as discussed in note c 
market risk and derivatives under our risk management policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations we are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating us to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
amounts in the following table are estimated based upon contractual terms  and actual amounts will likely differ from amounts presented below 
further disclosure regarding our contractual obligations is included in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements

these obligations include other purchase obligations of million each for and e projected pension funding status is based on current actuarial estimates and is subject to future revision 
f uncertain tax positions of million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open income tax years will be closed with completed examinations 
we are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the month period ending december  g in  pec must begin transitioning north carolina jurisdictional amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of million must be complete by december   and at least percent must be transitioned each year 
other matters synthetic fuels tax credits historically  we have had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the code section 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differ significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the fuel was produced from a facility that was placed in service before july  qualifying synthetic fuels facilities entitled their owners to federal income tax credits based on the barrel of oil equivalent of the synthetic fuels produced and sold by these plants 
the tax credits associated with synthetic fuels in a particular year were phased out if annual average market prices for crude oil exceeded certain prices 
synthetic fuels were generally not economical to produce and sell absent the credits 
the synthetic fuels tax credit program expired at the end of tax credits legislation enacted in redesignated the section tax credit as a general business credit under section k of the code section k effective january  the previous amount of section tax credits that we were allowed to claim in any calendar year through december   was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits 
the redesignation of section tax credits as a section k general business credit removes the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a year carry forward period 
this provision allowed us to produce more synthetic fuels than we have historically produced  should we have chosen to do so 
total section k credits generated through december  including those generated by florida progress prior to our acquisition  were approximately billion  of which billion has been used to offset regular federal income tax liability  million is being carried forward as deferred tax credits and million has been reserved due to the estimated phase out of tax credits due to high oil prices  as described below 
impact of crude oil prices section provided that if the annual average price exceeded the threshold price  the amount of section k tax credits was reduced for that year 
also  if the annual average price exceeded the phase out price  the section k tax credits were eliminated for that year 
the threshold price and the phase out price were adjusted annually for inflation 
if the annual average price fell between the threshold price and the phase out price for a year  the amount by which section k tax credits were reduced depended on where the annual average price fell in that continuum 
the department of the treasury calculates the annual average price based on the domestic crude oil first purchases prices published by the energy information agency eia 
because the eia publishes its information on a three month lag  the secretary of the treasury finalizes the calculations three months after the year in question ends 
thus  the annual average price for calendar year was published on april  based on the annual average price for calendar year of  our synthetic fuels tax credits generated during were reduced by percent  or approximately million 
the annual average price for calendar year is expected to be published in early april on september   we idled production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned synthetic fuels facilities 
as discussed below  the decision to idle production was based on the high level of oil prices  and the resumption of synthetic fuels production was dependent upon a number of factors  including a reduction in oil prices 
on october   based upon the continued high level of oil prices  unfavorable oil price projections through the end of  and the expiration of the synthetic fuels tax credit program at the end of  we permanently ceased production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned facilities 
the operation of synthetic fuels facilities on behalf of third parties continued through late because we have abandoned our majority owned facilities and our other synthetic fuels operations ceased in late december  we reclassified the operations of our synthetic fuels businesses as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of we estimate that the threshold price will be approximately per barrel and the phase out price will be approximately per barrel  based on an estimated inflation adjustment for the monthly domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the eia has recently averaged approximately lower than the corresponding daily new york mercantile exchange nymex prompt month settlement price for light sweet crude oil 
through december   the average nymex settlement price for light sweet crude oil was per barrel 
based upon the estimated threshold price and phase out price and assuming that the average differential between the domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the eia and the nymex settlement price continued through december   we estimate that the synthetic fuels tax credit amount for will be reduced by approximately percent 
therefore  we reserved percent or approximately million of the million of tax credits generated during the final calculations of any reductions in the value of the tax credits will not be determined until april when final oil prices are published 
in january  we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices over an average annual oil price range of to per barrel on a nymex basis 
the notional quantity of these oil price hedge instruments was million barrels and provided protection for the equivalent of approximately million tons of synthetic fuels production and was marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
the derivative contracts ended on december   and were settled for cash on january   with no material impact on earnings 
approximately percent of the notional quantity of these contracts was entered into by ceredo synfuel llc ceredo 
as discussed below in sales of partnership interests and in notes c and j  we disposed of our percent ownership interest in ceredo in march during the year ended december   we recorded net pre tax gains of million related to these contracts  including million attributable to ceredo  of which million was attributed to minority interest for the portion of the gain subsequent to disposal 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note a and for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
impairment of synthetic fuels and other related long lived assets we monitor our long lived assets for impairment as warranted 
with the idling of our synthetic fuels facilities during the second quarter of due to the high level of oil prices  we performed an impairment evaluation of our synthetic fuels and other related operating long lived assets 
the impairment test considered numerous factors  including  among other things  continued high oil prices and the then current idle state of our synthetic fuels facilities 
based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million million after tax during the quarter ended june  see notes and 
these charges represent the entirety of the asset carrying value of our synthetic fuels intangible assets and manufacturing facilities  as well as a portion of the asset carrying value associated with the river terminals at which the synthetic fuels manufacturing facilities are located 
as discussed in note b  these charges have been reclassified to discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income 
sales of partnership interests in march  we disposed of  through our subsidiary progress fuels  our percent ownership interest in ceredo  a subsidiary that produces and sells qualifying coal based solid synthetic fuels  to a third party buyer 
in addition  we entered into an agreement to operate the ceredo facility on behalf of the buyer 
at closing  we received cash proceeds of million and a nonrecourse note receivable of million 
payments on the note are due as we produce and sell qualifying coal based solid synthetic fuels on behalf of the buyer 
during  we produced million tons 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we received payments on the note related to production of million in and million subsequent to year end 
the total amount of proceeds is subject to adjustment once the final value of the section k credits is known 
pursuant to the terms of the disposal agreement  the buyer had the right to unwind the transaction if an internal revenue service irs reconfirmation private letter ruling was not received by november   or if certain adverse changes in tax law  as defined in the agreement  occurred before november  the irs reconfirmation private letter ruling was received on october   and no adverse change in tax law occurred prior to november  as of december   due to indemnification provisions  we recorded losses on disposal of million based on the estimated value of the section k tax credits 
the operations of ceredo have been reclassified to discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to the disposal  we remained the primary beneficiary of ceredo and continued to consolidate ceredo in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  but we have recorded a percent minority interest 
consequently  subsequent to the disposal there was no net earnings impact from ceredo s operations 
in connection with the disposal  progress fuels and progress energy provided guarantees and indemnifications for certain legal and tax matters to the buyer  which increases the loss on disposal or reduces any potential deferred gain 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in adjustments to the loss on disposal in future periods see note j and note c 
in june  through our subsidiary progress fuels  we sold in two transactions a combined percent partnership interest in colona synfuel limited partnership  lllp colona  one of our synthetic fuels facilities 
the transactions were structured such that proceeds from the sales would be received over time  which was typical of such sales in the industry 
gains from the sales are recognized on a cost recovery basis 
gain recognition is dependent on the synthetic fuels production qualifying for section k tax credits and the value of such tax credits  as discussed above 
until the gain recognition criteria are met  gains from selling interests in colona were deferred 
due to the impact on production from the idling of the synthetic fuels facilities as discussed above and pursuant to the terms of the sales agreements  in january  the purchasers abandoned their interests in colona 
we recognized a million gain and million gain on these transactions in the years ended december  and  respectively  which have been reclassified to discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income see note l 
in  due to the increase in the price of oil that limits synthetic fuels tax credits  we did not record any additional gain 
see note d and item a  risk factors for additional discussion related to our synthetic fuels operations 
regulatory environment the utilities operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the utilities are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of one or more of these governmental agencies 
to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give retail ratepayers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
we cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase retail competition in the electric industry 
the retail rate matters affected by state regulatory authorities are discussed in detail in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the president signed into law the federal energy independence and security act of the legislation strengthened corporate average fuel economy standards for automotive manufacturers fleets of passenger cars and light trucks and significantly increased the amount of ethanol required to be used as a gasoline additive 
the legislation also provided incentives for the development of plug in hybrid electric vehicles and created new energy efficiency standards in commercial  residential and governmental use 
in addition  the legislation authorized increased funding for research into the use of carbon capture and storage technology  and directs states to consider smart grid improvements to transmission infrastructure 
the law did not contain any provisions for a federal renewable portfolio standard 
during  the north carolina legislature passed comprehensive energy legislation  which became law on august  the law mandates minimum reps for the use of energy from specified renewable energy resources or implementation of energy efficiency measures by the state s electric utilities beginning with a percent requirement in and increasing to percent in for regulated public utilities  including pec 
the premium to be paid by electric utilities to comply with the requirements  above the cost they would have otherwise incurred to meet consumer demand  is to be recovered through an annual clause 
the annual amount that can be recovered through the reps clause is capped and once a utility has expended monies equal to the cap  the utility is deemed to have met its obligations under the reps  regardless of the actual renewables generated or purchased 
the law grants the ncuc authority to modify or alter the reps requirements if the ncuc determines it is in the public interest to do so 
the recovery cap requirement begins in and  as a result  pec will begin deferring certain costs associated with renewable energy purchases in these costs are expected to be immaterial in the law allows the utility to meet a portion of the reps with energy reductions achieved through energy efficiency programs 
energy efficiency programs include any program or activity implemented after january   that results in less energy being used to perform the same function 
through the year  a utility can use energy efficiency programs to satisfy up to percent of their reps  beginning in  these programs may constitute up to percent of the requirements 
the law allows the utility to recover the costs of new dsm and energy efficiency programs through an annual dsm clause 
the law allows the utility to capitalize those costs that are intended to produce future benefits and authorizes the ncuc to approve other forms of financial incentives to the utility for dsm and energy efficiency programs 
dsm programs include any program or initiative that shifts the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods and includes load management  electricity system and operating controls  direct load control and interruptible load 
pec has begun implementing a series of dsm and energy efficiency programs and deferred million of implementation and program costs for future recovery for the year ended december  the law also expands the definition of the traditional fuel clause so that additional costs may be recovered annually 
these additional costs include costs of reagents commodities such as ammonia and limestone used in emissions control technologies  the avoided costs associated with renewable energy purchases and certain components of purchased power not previously recoverable through the fuel clause see additional discussion below 
the north carolina law also authorizes the ncuc to allow annual prudence reviews of the construction costs of a baseload generating plant if requested by the public utility that is constructing the plant and removes the requirement that a public utility prove financial distress before it may include construction work in progress in rate base and adjust rates  accordingly  in a general rate case while a baseload generating plant is under construction 
on october   the ncuc issued its proposed rules for implementation of the law 
pec expects final rules to be issued by the end of the first quarter of until the rulemaking process is completed  we cannot predict the costs of complying with the law 
pec would be able to annually recover its reasonable prudent compliance costs 
during  the south carolina legislature ratified new energy legislation  which became law on may  key elements of the law include expansion of the annual fuel clause mechanism to include recovery of the costs of reagents used in the operation of pec s emissions control technologies see additional discussion below 
the law also includes provisions to provide base rate cost recovery for upfront development costs associated with nuclear baseload generation and construction costs associated with nuclear or coal baseload generation without a base rate proceeding and the ability to recover financing costs for new nuclear baseload generation through annual clauses 
on november   pec filed a petition with the scpsc seeking authorization to create a deferred account for dsm and energy efficiency program expenses pending the filing of application requesting a dsm and energy efficiency program expense clause to recover such program costs 
on december   the scpsc granted pec s petition 
as a result  through december   pec deferred an immaterial amount of implementation and program costs for future recovery in the south carolina jurisdiction 
on july   the governor of florida issued executive orders to address reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
the executive orders call for the first southeastern state cap and trade program and include adoption of a maximum allowable emissions level of greenhouse gases for florida utilities 
the standard will require  at a minimum  the following three reduction milestones by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  and by  emissions not greater than percent of year utility sector emissions 
among other things  the executive orders also requested that the fpsc initiate a rulemaking by september   that would require florida utilities to produce at least percent of their electricity from renewable sources  reduce the cost of connecting solar and other renewable energy technologies to florida s power grid by adopting uniform statewide interconnection standards for all utilities  and authorize a uniform  statewide method to enable residential and commercial customers  who generate electricity from on site renewable technologies of up to mw in capacity  to offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing their electric meters to turn backward when they generate electricity net metering 
the fpsc has held meetings regarding the renewable portfolio standard but no actions have been taken or rules issued 
the energy and climate action team appointed by the governor submitted its initial recommendations for implementation of the governor s executive orders on november  the recommendations encourage the development and implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures  implementation of a climate registry and consideration of a cap and trade approach to reducing the state s greenhouse gas emissions 
additional development and discussion of the recommendations will occur through a stakeholder process in the florida department of environmental protection held its first rulemaking workshop on the greenhouse gas emissions cap on august   and a second workshop on december  we anticipate drafts of the rule will be issued in in addition  the florida energy commission  which was established by the legislature in  published its energy policy and climate change recommendations on december  the report includes proposed legislative language that would implement energy efficiency and conservation programs  participation in the multi state climate registry and emissions reduction targets that are similar to those contained in the governor s executive orders 
we cannot currently predict the costs of complying with the laws and regulations that may ultimately result from these executive orders and the florida energy commission s recommendations 
our balanced solution  as described in increasing energy demand  includes greater investment in energy efficiency  renewable energy and state of the art generation and demonstrates our commitment to environmental responsibility 
on april   the fpsc adopted a rule that specifies what storm costs will be recoverable and whether such recoverable costs would be offset against a utility s storm reserve fund or recoverable through its base rates 
pef does not believe that compliance with this rule will materially increase its costs 
epact  among other provisions  gave the ferc accountability for system reliability and the authority to impose civil penalties 
epact provides procedures and rules for the establishment of an electric reliability organization ero that will propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards 
on july   the ferc certified the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as the ero 
included in this certification was a provision for the ero to delegate authority for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards in particular regions of the country by entering into delegation agreements with regional entities 
the serc reliability corporation serc and the florida reliability coordinating council frcc are the regional entities for pec and pef  respectively 
as discussed in future liquidity and capital resources other regulatory matters  during and  the ferc approved a significant number of reliability standards developed by the nerc and set aside other standards pending further development 
compliance with ferc approved reliability standards is mandatory for all registered users  owners and operators of the bulk power system  including pec and pef 
prior to the ferc action  electric utility industry compliance with the nerc standards had been voluntary 
based on ferc s directive to revise of the adopted standards  we expect standards to migrate to more definitive and enforceable requirements over time 
we are committed to meeting those standards 
the financial impact of mandatory compliance cannot currently be determined 
failure to comply with the reliability standards could result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties 
if we are unable to meet the reliability standards for the bulk power system in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
prior to the effective date of mandatory compliance with the reliability standards  pec self reported two noncompliances and pef self reported three noncompliances 
entities responsible for enforcement of mandatory reliability standards have proposed that entities that self reported noncompliance prior to the effective date and pursue aggressive mitigation plans will not be assessed fines 
subsequent to the effective date  pec self reported three noncompliances with voluntary standards and pef self reported one noncompliance with voluntary standards and one noncompliance with a mandatory standard 
pec and pef have submitted mitigation plans to address the self reported noncompliance 
the costs of executing the mitigation plans are not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or liquidity 
legal we are subject to federal  state and local legislation and court orders 
these matters are discussed in detail in note d 
this discussion identifies specific issues  the status of the issues  accruals associated with issue resolutions and our associated exposures 
increasing energy demand meeting the anticipated growth within the utilities service territories will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are expanding our energy efficiency programs  investing in the development of alternative energy resources for the future  and operating state of the art plants that produce energy cleanly and efficiently by modernizing existing plants and pursuing options for building new plants and associated transmission facilities 
we are actively pursuing expansion of our energy efficiency and conservation programs as energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs  offset the need for new power plants and protect the environment 
our energy efficiency program provides simple  low cost ways for residential customers to reduce energy use  promotes home energy checks  provides tools and programs for large and small businesses to minimize their energy use and provides an interactive internet web site with online calculators  programs and efficiency tips 
we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects  including solar  hydrogen  biomass and landfill gas technologies 
we are evaluating the feasibility of producing electricity from hog waste and other plant or animal sources 
in the coming years  we will continue to invest in existing plants and consider plans for building new generating plants 
due to the anticipated growth in our service territories  we estimate that we will require new generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas toward the end of the next decade  and we are evaluating the best available options for this generation  including advanced design nuclear and gas technologies 
at this time  no definitive decisions have been made to construct new nuclear plants 
while we pursue expansion of energy efficiency and conservation programs  pec has announced a two year moratorium on constructing new coal fired plants and that if pec goes ahead with a new nuclear plant  the new plant would not be online until at least see nuclear below 
as authorized under epact  on october   the united states department of energy doe published final regulations for the disbursement of up to billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects using innovative technologies 
the guarantees  which will cover up to percent of the amount of any loan for no more than percent of the project cost  are expected to spur development of nuclear  clean coal and ethanol projects 
congress has approved billion in loan guarantees  with the doe seeking an additional billion in loan guarantees in its fiscal budget request 
initial applications for loan guarantees were for non nuclear projects but it is expected that approval of additional funding could result in guarantees being available for nuclear generation projects 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
on november   pec filed an application with the nrc for a year extension of the shearon harris nuclear plant harris operating license 
the license renewal application for harris is currently under review by the nrc with a decision expected in our nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs and certain other modifications see notes and d 
we previously announced that we are pursuing development of col applications to potentially construct new nuclear plants in north carolina and florida 
filing of a col is not a commitment to build a nuclear plant but is a necessary step to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
on january   we announced that pec selected a site at harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we have selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pec s application submission 
on february   pec filed its col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  the new plant would not be online until at least see increasing energy demand above 
on december   we announced that pef selected a site in levy county  fla  to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we have selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pef s application submission 
pef expects to file the application for the col in if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decision to build is made  safety related construction activities could begin as early as  and a new plant could be online in see increasing energy demand above 
in  pef completed the purchase of approximately  acres for the levy county site and associated transmission needs 
pef anticipates filing a determination of need petition with the fpsc in in  both the levy county planning commission and the board of commissioners voted unanimously in favor of pef s requests to change the comprehensive land use plan 
the florida department of community affairs fdca reviewed the proposed changes to the comprehensive land use plan and in their report  the fdca expressed concerns related to the intensity of use and environmental suitability for some of the proposed amendments impacting pef s proposed levy county nuclear site 
we anticipate that the levy county planning commission will resolve the fdca s concerns without impact to the potential project schedule 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
a new nuclear plant may be eligible for the federal production tax credits and risk insurance provided by epact 
epact provides an annual tax credit of cents per kwh for nuclear facilities for the first eight years of operation 
the credit is limited to the first  mw of new nuclear generation in the united states and has an annual cap of million per  mw of national mw capacity limitation allocated to the unit 
in april  the irs provided interim guidance that the  mw of production tax credits generally will be allocated to new nuclear facilities that file license applications with the nrc by december   had poured safety related concrete prior to january   and were placed in service before january  there is no guarantee that the interim guidance will be incorporated into the final regulations governing the allocation of production tax credits 
multiple utilities have announced plans to pursue new nuclear plants 
there is no guarantee that any nuclear plant we construct would qualify for these or other incentives 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in accordance with provisions of florida s comprehensive energy bill enacted in  the fpsc ordered new rules in december that would allow investor owned utilities such as pef to request recovery of certain planning and construction costs of a nuclear power plant prior to commercial operation 
the fpsc issued a final rule on february   under which utilities will be allowed to recover prudently incurred siting  preconstruction costs and afudc on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned once the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
such amounts will not be included in a utility s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
in addition  the rule will require the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
also  on february   the fpsc amended its power plant bid rules to  among other things  exempt nuclear power plants from existing bid requirements 
in  the south carolina legislature ratified new energy legislation  which includes provisions for cost recovery mechanisms associated with nuclear baseload generation 
the north carolina legislature ratified new energy legislation  which authorizes the ncuc to allow annual prudence reviews of baseload generating plant construction costs and removes the requirement that a public utility prove financial distress before it may include construction work in progress in rate base and adjust rates  accordingly  in a general rate case while a baseload generating plant is under construction see other matters regulatory environment 
environmental matters we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
environmental laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate costs of compliance cannot be precisely estimated 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liabilities 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina  the state of florida or potentially responsible parties prp groups 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of these potential claims cannot be predicted 
no material claims are currently pending 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note a 
we accrue costs to the extent our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap 
because the extent of environmental impact  allocation among prps for all sites  remediation alternatives which could involve either minimal or significant efforts  and concurrence of the regulatory authorities have not yet reached the stage where a reasonable estimate of the remediation costs can be made  we cannot determine the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the remediation of all sites at this time 
it is probable that current estimates could change and additional losses  which could be material  may be incurred in the future 
air quality and water quality we are  or may ultimately be  subject to various current and proposed federal  state and local environmental compliance laws and regulations  which would likely result in increased capital expenditures and o m expenses 
additionally  congress is considering legislation that would require additional reductions in air emissions of nitrogen oxides nox  so  co and mercury 
some of these proposals establish nationwide caps and emission rates over an extended period of time 
this national multipollutant approach to air pollution control could involve significant capital costs that could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
control equipment that will be installed pursuant to the provisions of the clean smokestacks act  cair  cavr and mercury regulation  which are discussed below  may address some of the issues outlined above 
cavr requires the installation of best available retrofit technology bart on certain units 
however  the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
the following tables contain information about our current estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations described below 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the outcome of future petitions for recovery cannot be predicted 
pec has completed installation of controls to meet the nox sip call rule under section of the clean air act nox sip call requirements 
the nox sip call is not applicable to florida 
expenditures for the nox sip call include the cost to install nox controls under north carolina s and south carolina s programs to comply with the federal eight hour ozone standard 
the air quality controls installed to comply with the nox sip call and clean smokestacks act will result in a reduction of the costs to meet the cair requirements for our north carolina units at pec 
our estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly 
the timing and extent of the costs for future projects will depend upon final compliance strategies

to date  under the first phase of clean smokestacks act emission reductions  all environmental compliance projects at our asheville plant and several projects at our roxboro plant have been placed in service 
the remaining projects at our two largest plants  roxboro and mayo  are under construction and are expected to be completed in and  respectively 
the remaining projects to comply with the second phase of emission reductions  which are smaller in scope  have not yet begun 
these estimates are currently under review and are conceptual in nature and subject to change 
to date  expenditures at pef for cair cavr mercury regulation primarily relate to environmental compliance projects under construction at cr and cr  which are expected to be placed in service in and  respectively

to meet cavr beyond bart requirements below 
new source review the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative related to a number of coal fired utility power plants in an effort to determine whether changes at those facilities were subject to new source review nsr requirements or new source performance standards under the clean air act 
we were asked to provide information to the epa as part of this initiative and cooperated in supplying the requested information 
the epa has undertaken civil enforcement actions against unaffiliated utilities as part of this initiative 
some of these actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring expenditures by these unaffiliated utilities  several of which were in excess of billion 
these settlement agreements have generally called for expenditures to be made over extended time periods  and some of the companies may seek recovery of the related costs through rate adjustments or similar mechanisms 
on april   the us supreme court issued a ruling on an appeal of a decision of the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit  in a case involving an unaffiliated utility 
the fourth circuit held that nsr applies to projects that result in an increase in maximum hourly emissions 
the us supreme court rejected the lower court decision and held that the epa is not required to adopt the maximum hourly emissions test but may use an actual annual emissions test to determine whether nsr applies 
on march   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc court of appeals set aside the epa s nsr equipment replacement rule 
the rule would have provided a more uniform definition of routine equipment replacement  which is excluded from nsr applicability 
the dc court of appeals denied a request by the epa for a re hearing regarding this matter on june  on november   the epa filed a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting that the us supreme court review the decision of the us court of appeals 
on april   the us supreme court denied the epa s petition 
in a previous case decided in late  the dc court of appeals had also set aside a provision in the nsr rule that had exempted the installation of pollution control projects from review 
these projects are now subject to nsr requirements  adding time and cost to the installation process 
clean smokestacks act in june  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from their north carolina coal fired power plants in phases by pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation capacity in north carolina that is affected by the clean smokestacks act 
in march  pec filed its annual estimate with the ncuc of the total capital expenditures to meet emission targets under the clean smokestacks act by the end of  which were approximately billion to billion at the time of the filing 
the increase in estimated total capital expenditures from the original estimate of million is primarily due to the higher cost and revised quantities of construction materials  such as concrete and steel  refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects  and increases in the estimated inflation factor applied to future project costs 
we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology and new generation options that could further change expenditures required by the clean smokestacks act 
o m expenses will significantly increase due to the cost of reagents  additional personnel and general maintenance associated with the equipment 
recent legislation in north carolina and south carolina expanded the traditional fuel clause to include the annual recovery of reagents and certain other costs  all other o m expenses are currently recoverable through base rates 
on march   pec filed a petition with the ncuc regarding future recovery of costs to comply with the clean smokestacks act  and on october   pec filed with the ncuc a settlement agreement with the ncuc public staff  cuca and cigfur supporting pec s proposal 
the ncuc held a hearing on this matter on october  on december   the ncuc approved the settlement agreement on a provisional basis

and mayo units impacted by the clean smokestacks act are jointly owned 
in  pec entered into an agreement with the joint owner to limit their aggregate costs associated with capital expenditures to comply with the clean smokestacks act and recognized a liability related to this indemnification see note b 
pursuant to the clean smokestacks act  pec entered into an agreement with the state of north carolina to transfer to the state certain nox and so emissions allowances that result from compliance with the collective nox and so emissions limitations set in the clean smokestacks act 
the clean smokestacks act also required the state to undertake a study of mercury and co emissions in north carolina 
the future regulatory interpretation  implementation or impact of the clean smokestacks act cannot be predicted 
clean air interstate rule  clean air mercury rule and clean air visibility rule on march   the epa issued the final cair 
the epa s rule requires the district of columbia and states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  to reduce nox and so emissions in order to reduce levels of fine particulate matter and impacts to visibility 
the cair sets emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nox and beginning in and  respectively  for so states were required to adopt rules implementing the cair 
the epa approved the north carolina cair on october   the south carolina cair on october   and the florida cair on october  pef has joined a coalition of florida utilities that has filed a challenge to the cair as it applies to florida 
a petition for reconsideration and stay and a petition for judicial review of the cair were filed on july  on october   the dc court of appeals issued an order granting the motion for stay of the proceedings 
on december   the epa announced a reconsideration of four aspects of the cair  including its applicability to florida 
on march   the epa denied all pending reconsiderations  allowing the challenge to proceed 
while we consider it unlikely that this challenge would eliminate the compliance requirements of the cair  it could potentially reduce or delay our costs to comply with the cair 
oral argument has been set by the dc court of appeals for march  on june   the florida environmental regulation commission adopted the florida cair  which is very similar to the epa s model rule 
an unaffiliated utility challenged the state adopted rule 
on november   the florida district court of appeals ruled against the challenge and in favor of the florida department of environmental protection 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
on march   the epa finalized two separate but related rules the camr that sets mercury emissions limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  and encourages a cap and trade approach to achieving those caps  and a delisting rule that eliminated any requirement to pursue a maximum achievable control technology approach for limiting mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
nox and so controls also are effective in reducing mercury emissions 
however  according to the epa  the second phase cap reflects a level of mercury emissions reduction that exceeds the level that would be achieved solely as a co benefit of controlling nox and so under cair 
the delisting rule was challenged by a number of parties 
sixteen states subsequently petitioned for a review of the epa s determination confirming the delisting 
on february   the dc court of appeals decided in favor of the petitioners and vacated the delisting determination and the camr 
the exact impacts of this decision are uncertain until the court s mandate is issued 
the three states in which the utilities operate have adopted mercury regulations implementing camr and submitted their state implementation rules to the epa 
it is uncertain how the vacation of the federal camr will affect the state rules 
on june   the epa issued the final cavr 
the epa s rule requires states to identify facilities  including power plants  built between august and august with the potential to produce emissions that affect visibility in specially protected areas  including national parks and wilderness areas 
to help restore visibility in those areas  states must require the identified facilities to install bart to control their emissions 
the reductions associated with bart begin in cavr included the epa s determination that compliance with the nox and so requirements of cair may be used by states as a bart substitute 
plans for compliance with cair and mercury regulation may fulfill bart obligations  but the states could require the installation of additional air quality controls if they do not achieve reasonable progress in improving visibility 
on december   the florida department of environmental protection finalized a regional haze implementation rule that requires sources significantly impacting visibility in class i areas to install additional controls by december  pec s bart eligible units are asheville units no 
and no 
 roxboro units no 
 no 
and no 
 and sutton unit no 
pef s bart eligible units are anclote units no 
and no 
 bartow unit no 
and crystal river units no 
and no 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on december   the dc court of appeals decided in favor of the epa in a case brought by the national parks conservation association that alleges the epa acted improperly by substituting the requirements of cair for bart for nox and so from electric generating units in areas covered by cair 
pec and pef are each developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet all the requirements of the cair  cavr and mercury regulation 
we are evaluating various design  technology and new generation options that could change pec s and pef s costs to meet the requirements of cair  cavr and mercury regulation 
the integrated compliance strategy pef anticipates implementing should provide most  but not all  of the nox reductions required by cair 
therefore  pef anticipates utilizing the cap and trade feature of cair by purchasing annual and seasonal nox allowances 
because the emission controls cannot be installed in time to meet cair s nox requirements in  pef anticipates purchasing a higher level of annual and seasonal allowances in that year 
the costs of these allowances would depend on market prices at the time these allowances are purchased 
pef expects to recover the costs of these allowances through its ecrc 
on october   the fpsc approved pef s petition for the recovery of costs associated with the development and implementation of an integrated strategy to comply with the cair  camr and cavr through the ecrc see discussion above regarding camr 
on march   pef filed a series of compliance alternatives with the fpsc to meet these federal environmental rules 
at the time  pef s recommended proposed compliance plan included approximately million of estimated capital costs expected to be spent through  to plan  design  build and install pollution control equipment at our anclote and crystal river plants 
on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for its integrated strategy to address compliance with cair  camr and cavr 
they also approved cost recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy 
on june   pef filed a supplemental petition for approval of its compliance plan and associated contracts and recovery of costs for air pollution control projects  which included approximately billion to billion of estimated capital costs for the range of alternative plans 
the estimated capital cost for the recommended plan  which was billion in the june  filing  represents the low end of the range in the table of estimated required environmental expenditures shown above 
the difference in costs between the recommended plan and the high end of the range represents the additional costs that may be incurred if pollution controls are required on crystal river units no 
and no 
in order to comply with the requirements of cavr beyond bart  should reasonable progress in improving visibility not be achieved  as discussed above 
the increase from the estimates filed in march is primarily due to the higher cost of labor and construction materials  such as concrete and steel  and refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects 
these costs will continue to change depending upon the results of the engineering and strategy development work and or increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs 
subsequent rule interpretations  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of the initial nox or other compliance dates  among other things  could require acceleration of some projects 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
north carolina attorney general petition under section of the clean air act in march  the north carolina attorney general filed a petition with the epa  under section of the clean air act  asking the federal government to force coal fired power plants in other states  including south carolina  to reduce their nox and so emissions 
the state of north carolina contends these out of state emissions interfere with north carolina s ability to meet national air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter 
on march   the epa issued a final response denying the petition 
the epa s rationale for denial is that compliance with cair will reduce the emissions from surrounding states sufficiently to address north carolina s concerns 
on june   the north carolina attorney general filed a petition in the dc court of appeals seeking a review of the agency s final action on the petition 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
national ambient air quality standards on december   the epa announced proposed changes to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate matter 
the epa proposed to lower the hour standard for particulate matter less than microns in diameter pm from micrograms per cubic meter to micrograms per cubic meter 
in addition  the epa proposed to establish a new hour standard of micrograms per cubic meter for particulate matter that is between and microns in diameter pm 
the epa also proposed to eliminate the current standards for particulate matter less than microns in diameter pm 
on september   the epa announced that it is finalizing the pm naaqs as proposed 
in addition  the epa decided not to establish a pm naaqs  and it is eliminating the annual pm naaqs  but the epa is retaining the hour pm naaqs 
these changes are not expected to result in designation of any additional nonattainment areas in pec s or pef s service territories 
on december   environmental groups and states filed a joint petition with the dc court of appeals arguing that the epa s new particulate matter rule does not adequately restrict levels of particulate matter 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on june   the epa announced proposed changes to the naaqs for ground level ozone 
the epa proposed to lower the hour primary standard from parts per million to a range of to parts per million 
the two alternatives proposed for the secondary standard are to either establish a new cumulative  seasonal standard or set the secondary standard as identical to the proposed primary standard 
depending on air quality improvements expected over the next several years as current federal requirements are implemented  additional nonattainment areas may be designated in pec s and pef s service territories 
the final rule is expected in march the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
water quality general as a result of the operation of certain control equipment needed to address the air quality issues outlined above  new wastewater streams may be generated at the affected facilities 
integration of these new wastewater streams into the existing wastewater treatment processes may result in permitting  construction and treatment requirements imposed on the utilities in the immediate and extended future 
section b of the clean water act section b of the clean water act section b requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
the epa promulgated a rule implementing section b in respect to existing power plants in july the july rule required assessment of the baseline environmental effect of withdrawal of cooling water and development of technologies and measures for reducing environmental effects by certain percentages 
additionally  the rule authorized establishment of alternative performance standards where the site specific costs of achieving the otherwise applicable standards would have been substantially greater than either the benefits achieved or the costs considered by the epa during the rulemaking 
subsequent to promulgation of the rule  a number of states  environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the rule 
on january   the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion and order remanding many provisions of the rule to the epa 
on july   the epa suspended the rule pending further rulemaking  with the exception of the requirement that permitting authorities establish best available technology controls for minimizing adverse environmental impact at existing cooling water intake structures on a case by case  best professional judgment basis 
on november   the utility water act group and several unaffiliated utilities filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the us supreme court 
on december   states filed an amicus brief in support of the utility water act group s petition 
as a result of these recent developments  our plans and associated estimated costs to comply with section b will need to be reassessed and determined in accordance with any revised or new implementing rule once it is established by the epa 
costs of compliance with a new implementing rule are expected to be higher  and could be significantly higher  than estimated costs under the july rule 
our most recent cost estimates to comply with the july implementing rule were million to million  including million to million at pec and million to million at pef 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
north carolina groundwater standard in  the north carolina environmental management commission granted approval for north carolina division of water quality ncdwq staff to publish a notice in the north carolina register and schedule public hearings regarding the ncdwq s recommendation to revise the state s groundwater quality standard for arsenic to milligrams liter from milligrams liter

other environmental matters global climate change the kyoto protocol was adopted in by the united nations to address global climate change by reducing emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
the treaty went into effect on february  the united states has not adopted the kyoto protocol  and the bush administration favors voluntary programs 
there are proposals and ongoing studies at the state and federal levels  including the state of florida  to address global climate change that would regulate co and other greenhouse gases 
see further discussion of the executive orders issued by the governor of florida to address reduction of greenhouse gas emissions under other matters regulatory environment 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by the kyoto protocol and some additional proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks related to changes in market conditions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a risk management committee that includes senior executives from various business groups 
the risk management committee is responsible for administering risk management policies and monitoring compliance with those policies by all subsidiaries 
under our risk policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
such instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the counterparty fails to perform under the contract 
we mitigate such risk by performing credit reviews using  among other things  publicly available credit ratings of such counterparties see note 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
certain market risks are inherent in our financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  changes in the market value of cvos and changes in energy related commodity prices 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with our operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
progress energy interest rate risk from time to time  we use interest rate derivative instruments to adjust the mix between fixed and floating rate debt in our debt portfolio  to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain debt instruments and to hedge interest rates with regard to future fixed rate debt issuances 
the notional amounts of interest rate derivatives are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the risk in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements only with banks with credit ratings of single a or better 
we use a number of models and methods to determine interest rate risk exposure and fair value of derivative positions 
for reporting purposes  fair values and exposures of derivative positions are determined at the end of the reporting period using the bloomberg financial markets system 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 interest rate derivatives that qualify as hedges are separated into one of two categories cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in cash flow due to fluctuating interest rates 
fair value hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and florida progress obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for to and thereafter and the related fair value

these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the fair value of these funds was billion and billion  respectively  including million and million  respectively  for pec and million and million  respectively  for pef 
we actively monitor our portfolio by benchmarking the performance of our investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the utilities regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect earnings 
see note for further information on the trust fund securities 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of florida progress  the parent issued million cvos 
each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
the cvos are derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of the cvos 
the sensitivity analysis performed on the cvos uses quoted prices obtained from brokers or quote services to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december  and  the cvo liability included in other liabilities and deferred credits on our consolidated balance sheets was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the december   market price would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the cvos 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
our exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of the utilities 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  most of our long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
we also have oil price risk exposure related to synthetic fuels tax credits as discussed in md a other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
most of our physical commodity contracts are not derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
or qualify as normal purchases or sales pursuant to sfas no 
therefore  such contracts are not recorded at fair value 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of our derivative commodity instruments that are not eligible for recovery from ratepayers 
the following discussion addresses the stand alone commodity risk created by these derivative commodity instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge 
the sensitivity analysis performed on these derivative commodity instruments uses quoted prices obtained from brokers to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december   the only derivative commodity instruments not eligible for recovery from ratepayers related to derivative contracts entered into on january   to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices as discussed below 
these contracts ended on december   and were settled for cash on january   with no material impact to earnings 
at december   derivative commodity instruments not eligible for recovery from ratepayers were included in discontinued operations as discussed below 
see note for additional information with regard to our commodity contracts and use of derivative financial instruments 
discontinued operations as discussed in note a  our subsidiary  pvi  entered into a series of transactions to sell or assign substantially all of its cco physical and commercial assets and liabilities 
on june   pvi closed the transaction involving the assignment of a contract portfolio consisting of the georgia contracts  forward gas and power contracts  gas transportation  structured power and other contracts to a third party 
this represented substantially all of our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations 
the sale of the generation assets closed on june  additionally  we sold gas on october  see note c 
at december   with the exception of the oil price hedge instruments discussed below  our discontinued operations did not have outstanding positions in derivative instruments 
for the year ended december   million of after tax gains from derivative instruments related to our nonregulated energy marketing and trading operations were included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income 
on january   we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices over an average annual oil price range of to per barrel on a new york mercantile exchange nymex basis 
the notional quantity of these oil price hedge instruments was million barrels and provided protection for the equivalent of approximately million tons of synthetic fuels production 
the cost of the hedges was approximately million 
the contracts were marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
these contracts ended on december   and were settled for cash on january   with no material impact to earnings 
approximately percent of the notional quantity of these contracts was entered into by ceredo 
as discussed in note j  we disposed of our percent ownership interest in ceredo on march  progress energy is the primary beneficiary of  and continues to consolidate ceredo in accordance with fin r  but we have recorded a percent minority interest 
consequently  subsequent to the disposal there is no net earnings impact for the portion of the contracts entered into by ceredo 
at december   the fair value of all of these contracts was recorded as a million short term derivative asset position  including million at ceredo 
the fair value of these contracts was included in receivables  net on the consolidated balance sheet see note a 
as discussed in note b  on october   we permanently ceased production of synthetic fuels at our majority owned facilities 
because we have abandoned our majority owned facilities and our other synthetic fuels operations ceased as of december   gains and losses on these contracts were included in discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statement of income in during the year ended december   we recorded net pre tax gains of million related to these contracts 
of this amount  million was attributable to ceredo of which million was attributed to minority interest for the portion of the gain subsequent to the disposal of ceredo 
at december   derivative assets of million and derivative liabilities of million were included in assets to be divested and liabilities to be divested  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet 
due to the divestitures discussed above  management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts would be fulfilled and cash flow hedge accounting for the contracts was discontinued beginning in the second quarter of for gas and in the fourth quarter of for cco 
our discontinued operations did not have material outstanding positions in commodity cash flow hedges at december  for the years ended december  and  excluding amounts reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges  net gains and losses from derivative instruments related to gas and cco on a consolidated basis were not material and are included in discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   discontinued operations  net of tax includes million in after tax deferred income  which was reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   there were no reclassifications to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges 
economic derivatives derivative products  primarily natural gas and oil contracts  may be entered into from time to time for economic hedging purposes 
while management believes the economic hedges mitigate exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices  these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are monitored consistent with trading positions 
we manage open positions with strict policies that limit our exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures 
the utilities have derivative instruments related to their exposure to price fluctuations on fuel oil and natural gas purchases 
these instruments receive regulatory accounting treatment 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded in regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets on the balance sheets  respectively  until the contracts are settled see note a 
once settled  any realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause 
during the year ended december   pec recorded a net realized loss of million 
pec s net realized gains and losses were not material during the years ended december  and during the years ended december   and  pef recorded a net realized loss of million  a net realized gain of million and a net realized gain of million  respectively 
excluding amounts receiving regulatory accounting treatment and amounts related to our discontinued operations discussed above  gains and losses from contracts entered into for economic hedging purposes were not material to our or the utilities results of operations during the years ended december   and excluding derivative assets and derivative liabilities to be divested discussed above  we did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts at december  and  other than those receiving regulatory accounting treatment at pec and pef  as discussed below 
at december   the fair value of pec s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million long term derivative asset position included in other assets and deferred debits and a million short term derivative liability position included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   pec did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts 
at december   the fair value of pef s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million short term derivative asset position included in prepayments and other current assets  a million long term derivative asset position included in derivative assets  and a million short term derivative liability position included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the fair value of such instruments was recorded as a million long term derivative asset position included in derivative assets  an million short term derivative liability position included in other current liabilities  and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet 
cash flow hedges pec designates a portion of commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the objective for holding these instruments is to hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of power for our forecasted sales 
realized gains and losses are recorded net in operating revenues 
pef did not have any commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges at december  and at december  and  we and pec did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts 
the ineffective portion of commodity cash flow hedges was not material to our or the utilities results of operations for  and at december  and  the amount recorded in our or pec s accumulated other comprehensive income related to commodity cash flow hedges was not material 
pef had no amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to commodity cash flow hedges at december  or pec pec has certain market risks inherent in its financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
pec s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds  and changes in energy related commodity prices
