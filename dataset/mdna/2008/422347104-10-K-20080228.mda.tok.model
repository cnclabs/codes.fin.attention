depreciation increased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the compared period 
this increase is attributable to the growth of our company owned tractor and trailer fleet  and an increased cost of new tractors and trailers relative to the costs of those units being replaced 
our tractor and trailer fleet have grown approximately and respectively in comparison to the same period in this contributed to a million increase in revenue equipment depreciation during also  higher depreciation on new corporate headquarters facilities and new phoenix terminal contributed to an increase of million in other property and equipment depreciation 
other operating expenses were essentially unchanged during the year ended december  compared to the same period of other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of the decline is attributable to an decrease in the total number of tractors and trailers traded during the period compared to the same period of a tractor fleet upgrade was completed in december during the company sold real estate in columbus  ohio  coralville  iowa  and dubois  pennsylvania recording total gains of approximately million 
the proceeds received from these sales were used in the financing of the new corporate headquarters 
interest income decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of because of the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and investments associated with the payment of the special dividend in may offset by improved rate of return on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments

operating revenue for both periods was positively impacted by fuel surcharges assessed to the customer base 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million  to million in from million reported in salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  to million in from million in these increases were the result of increased reliance on employee drivers due to a decrease in the number of independent contractors utilized by the company and a driver pay increase 
the company increased driver pay by per mile in january for all drivers maintaining a valid hazardous materials endorsement on their commercial driver s license and implemented quarterly pay increases for selected operating divisions 
these increases to driver compensation resulted in a cost increase of approximately million in during  employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors of the total fleet miles  compared with and  respectively  in workers compensation expense increased million to million in from million in due to an increase in frequency and severity of claims 
health insurance expense increased million to million in from million in due to an increase in frequency and severity of claims and increased reliance on employee drivers

rent and purchased transportation for both periods includes amounts paid to independent contractors for fuel stabilization 
the company increased the base mileage rate for independent contractors by per mile in the first quarter of for the second consecutive year 
in the first quarter of  the company increased the independent contractor base mileage pay by per mile for all independent contractors maintaining a hazardous materials endorsement on their commercial driver s license  and an additional per mile per quarter beginning on april  fuel increased million  to million in from million in the increase is the result of increased fuel prices and an increased reliance on company owned tractors 
the company s fuel cost per company owned tractor mile increased in compared to fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge  decreased in compared to the company s fuel cost per gallon increased in compared to primarily due to continued instability in the middle east and concerns over domestic inventory levels 
operations and maintenance decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributed to the improved average age of the revenue equipment in our fleet 
the average age of our tractor fleet is years while the average age of the trailer fleet is years 
in  the average age of tractors was years with trailers averaging years 
insurance and claims decreased million  to million in from million in due to a decrease in the frequency and severity of claims 
depreciation increased million  to million in from million in this increase is attributable to the growth of our company owned tractor and trailer fleet  an increased cost of new tractors primarily associated with the epa mandated clean air engines  a fleet upgrade during  and the implementation of sfas no 
new tractors have a higher cost than the models being replaced due to epa mandated clean air standards 
as of december   of the company s tractor fleet had the epa clean air engine compared to at december  for the year ended december   as a result of sfas no 
 approximately million of additional depreciation was recognized due to a higher depreciable basis of revenue equipment acquired through trade ins 
for the same period of  the additional depreciation attributable to sfas no 
was  in future periods  we expect depreciation will increase as we continue to upgrade our fleet in compliance with epa mandated engine changes and due to the impact of sfas no 
other operating expenses increased million  to million in from million in other operating expenses consist of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment increased million  to million in from million in the period 
the period includes million from gains on trade ins of revenue equipment which are recognized under sfas no 
compared to million for the same period of prior to the implementation of sfas no  gains from trade ins of revenue equipment were deferred as a reduction of the basis of the new equipment 
management does not believe gains in the future will be at similar levels realized in the period 
interest income increased million  to million in from million in the increase is the result of higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and higher yields than the company s effective tax rate was for and  respectively 
income taxes have been provided for at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with for net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology  epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufacturered after january   and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout   and  thus increasing our cost of operations 
in addition to the increased fuel costs  the reduced fuel efficiency of the new epa engines has put additional pressure on profitability due to increased fuel consumption 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry  such as lower demand for transportation services  could affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
the company s primary source of liquidity for the year ended december   was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in due primarily to net income excluding noncash depreciation  deferred tax and amortization of unearned compensation  and gains on disposal of equipment being approximately million lower in compared to and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities decrease of approximately million 
the net decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of changes in insurance accruals and accrued compensation 
cash flow from operating activities was of operating revenues in compared with in capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  totaled million for compared to million during we currently expect capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trades in  to be comparable to capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trades in total expenditures for the new corporate headquarters  including furniture and fixtures  and shop facility in north liberty  iowa and phoenix facility were approximately million during the company paid cash dividends of million in compared to million in the company paid a one time special dividend of million during the second quarter of the company declared a million cash dividend in december  included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december   which was paid on january  the company paid income taxes of million in which was essentially unchanged compared to million paid in in september   the board of directors of the company authorized a program to repurchase million shares  adjusted for stock splits  of the company s common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash and cash equivalents 
the authorization to repurchase remains open at december  and has no expiration date 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for approximately million at approximately per share 
this compares to approximately million shares of the company s common repurchased for million at approximately per share during the year ended december  the repurchased shares were subsequently retired 
at december   the company has approximately million shares remaining under the current board of director repurchase authorization 
future purchases are dependent upon market conditions 
management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
management believes the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded from cash flow provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the company ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and no debt 
net working capital for the year ended december  decreased by million over the most significant transaction causing the decrease was the sale of short term investments of approximately million to fund the special dividend payment of million discussed above 
working capital was positively impacted by the million reduction in current tax liabilities due to the adoption of fin based on the company s strong financial position  management believes outside financing could be obtained  if necessary  to fund capital expenditures 
primarily all of the company s investments as of december  are in short term investments in auction rate student loan educational bonds backed by the us government 
the investments typically have an interest reset provision of days with contractual maturities generally greater than years from the date of original issuance 
all investments held by the company have aaa or equivalent ratings from recognized rating agencies 
at the reset date the company has the option to roll the investment and reset the interest rate or sell the investment in an auction 
the company receives the par value of the investment plus accrued interest on the reset date if the underlying investment is sold in an auction 
there is no guarantee that when the company elects to participate in an auction and therefore sell investments  that a willing buyer will purchase the security and therefore the company receive cash upon the election to sell 
the company has not historically experienced any failures in auctions of such investments when it has elected to sell an investment  but has experienced unsuccessful auctions during february as discussed in the footnotes to the financials 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rate of the underlying investment is reset to a default maximum interest rate as stated in the prospectus of the underlying security 
until a subsequent auction is successful or the underlying security is called by the issuer  the company will be required to hold the underlying investment until maturity 
the company only holds senior positions of underlying securities 
the company does not invest in asset backed securities and does not have direct securitized sub prime mortgage loans exposure or loans to  commitments in  or investments in sub prime lenders 
should the company have a need to liquidate any of these investments  the company may be required to discount these securities for liquidity  but the company currently does not have this liquidity requirement 
based on historical and current operating cash flows  the company does not currently anticipate a requirement to liquidate underlying investments at discounted pricing 
if current conditions in the credit and capital markets continue  we may be required to recognize impairments and or reclassify these investments from short term to long term investments 
further  the company may be required to seek alternative financing arrangements 
off balance sheet transactions the company s liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  the company did not have any purchase obligations  significant operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations or outstanding long term debt obligations 
at december   the company had a total of million in gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this amount  million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to the state income tax filing position for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
the total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december  interest and penalties related to income taxes are classified as income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for the years and forward 
tax years and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on the tax code of each state 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
these changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations  examinations or other unforeseen circumstances 
as of december   the company did not have any ongoing examinations or outstanding litigation related to tax matters 
at this time  management s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be a decrease of approximately to million mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been established due to the profitability of the company s business 
further  management judgment is required in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements based on recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period

based on historical and current operating cash flows  the company does not currently anticipate a requirement to liquidate underlying investments at discounted pricing 
if current conditions in the credit and capital markets continue  we may be required to recognize impairments and or reclassify these investments from short term to long term investments 
assuming we maintain our short term investment balance consistent with balances as of december   million  and if market rates of interest on our short term investments decreased by basis points  the estimated reduction in annual interest income would be approximately million 
the company has no debt outstanding as of december  and therefore  has no market risk related to debt 
volatile fuel prices will continue to impact us significantly 
based on the company s historical experience  the company is not able to pass through to customers of fuel price increases 
for the year ended december  and  fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  was million and million or and  respectively  of the company s total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge 
a significant increase in fuel costs  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in february  the board of directors authorized the company to begin hedging activities related to commodity fuels 
in the event of hedging activities  the company will implement the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and contract with an unrelated third party to transact the hedge 
it is expected any such transactions will be accounted for on a mark to market with changes reflected in the statement of income as a component of fuel costs 
as of december   the company has no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to diesel fuel price fluctuations
