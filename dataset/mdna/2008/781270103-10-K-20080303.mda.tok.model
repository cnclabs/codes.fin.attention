item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of high performance process control metrology  defect inspection  and data analysis systems used by semiconductor device manufacturers 
we provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems and integrated modules for both transparent and opaque thin film measurements and macro defect inspection 
all of these systems feature production worthy automation and are backed by worldwide customer support 
on december   rudolph  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  mariner acquisition company llc  entered into  and consummated the transactions contemplated by  an agreement with applied precision holdings  llc and applied precision  llc collectively  applied  pursuant to which we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the semiconductor division of applied to be known as the probe card test and analysis division pcta 
the pcta is engaged in the business of designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing  selling and supporting advanced probe card metrology and wafer probe process monitoring equipment and is complementary to our existing business 
the closing occurred on december  and we paid million in cash and issued million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we agreed to assume the following liabilities of applied relating to the pcta accounts payable  assigned contracts  licenses and leases  warranty claims and employee liabilities 
in addition  we agreed to assume the defense of and all obligations relating to certain litigation 
the cash portion of the purchase price is subject to further post closing adjustment based on the final closing net asset balance 
the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated based on estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the final valuation of net assets is expected to be completed during  but no later than one year from the acquisition date 
the results of operations of the pcta have been included in our consolidated financials statements since the date of the acquisition 
due to the size of the pcta  we do not expect a material effect  other than the in process research and development iprd charge  on comparability to prior periods of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
on february   the merger with august technology was completed 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to former august technology shareholders 
the results of operations of august technology have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the merger 
due to the size of august technology and the effects of purchase accounting  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to prior periods 
with the exception of future tax adjustments related to the merger  the effects of purchase accounting were completed in rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors  including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer  cell phone and personal electronic device sales 
current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year over year decrease in capital spending of for we monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill above one shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
the three month rolling average north american semiconductor equipment book to bill ratio was for the month of december  increasing from the september book to bill ratio of historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the years ended december   and  sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for  
table of contents  and of our revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system and our macro defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon exclusively as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets

table of contents results of operations  and revenues 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and software licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the increase in revenue from to was primarily related to the august technology merger 
the decrease in revenue from to is primarily due to the current weakness in the overall semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector 
the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the different sources of our revenues in dollars and as percentages of our total revenues year ended december  systems metrology inspection parts services software licensing total revenue systems revenue increased from to reflecting additional revenues of million related to the august technology merger and an increase in metrology systems revenues of million 
systems revenue decreased from to due to the current weakness in the overall semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector and reflects a decrease in metrology systems revenue of million and a decrease in inspection systems of million 
systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for and of total revenue for the year over year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to reflects additional parts and service revenues of million related to the august technology merger as well as customers continuing to spend more on repair and maintenance of their existing equipment 
the year over year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to is primarily due to customers continuing to spend more on repair and maintenance of their existing equipment 
parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 
software licensing revenues increased from to due to the august technology merger 
the year over year increase in software licensing revenues in absolute dollars from to reflects the sale of certain technology rights to tokyo electron 
deferred revenues of million are recorded in other current liabilities at december  and primarily consist of million for deferred maintenance agreements and million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables 
gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including inventory step up from purchase accounting  manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  and parts and service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to higher sales volume  partially offset by charges to cost of goods sold including a million charge for the sale of inventory written up to fair value upon the august technology merger and million in charges related to duplicative inventory 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to the sales and transfer of certain technology rights to tokyo electron and higher charges to cost of goods sold in 
table of contents research and development 
the thin film transparent  opaque process control and macro defect inspection and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar increase from to primarily reflects additional research and development cost of million related to the merged activities of august technology and increased compensation costs including share based compensation costs 
the year over year dollar increase from to is primarily due to the engineering team from the august technology merger being included for the full year ended december   and the write off of million for certain software project costs  partially offset by cost containment initiatives 
we continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products as we position ourselves for future growth 
in process research and development 
in  the merger with august technology resulted in our recording of million for the write off of iprd 
at the time of the merger  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
the purchased in process technology projects  which were comprised of macro defect inspection and software projects  had a value assigned to them of million and million  respectively 
the defect inspection projects  relate to the next generation of our axi defect detection systems with enhanced defect capture capabilities  and were approximately complete as of the date of merger 
the estimated costs to complete these projects consisted primarily of internal engineering labor costs and were completed by the third quarter of the software projects  relate to new enhancement features to our next generation inspection products  and were approximately complete as of the date of merger  with the remaining cost to complete consisting primarily of internal software development labor cost 
the software projects were completed in we generated revenue from the inspection project in the third quarter of and the software project in in  the acquisition of the pcta resulted in our recording of million for the write off of iprd 
at the time of the acquisition  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
the purchased in process technology project was a probe card test project related to the next generation of our probeworx systems with enhanced capabilities  and was approximately complete as of the date of acquisition 
the estimated costs to complete this project of million  consist primarily of internal engineering labor costs which will be completed in if we are not successful in completing the inspection project on a timely basis  the future sales of our inspection products may be adversely affected resulting in erosion of our market share 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to million related to merged activities of august technology and increased compensation costs 
the year over year dollar increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to administrative costs associated with the merged activities of august technology being included for the full year of and increased compensation costs 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other  net consisted primarily of interest 
table of contents income and realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities 
the year over year increases in interest income and other  net of million from to and million from to are primarily due to higher invested cash balances and higher average interest rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of primarily as a function of state income taxes offset by benefits from research and development tax credits  the domestic manufacturing production deduction and tax exempt interest 
in addition  in and  our effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility of the iprd charges for tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
however  in  as our revenues declined from million to million  our change in accounts receivables represented a use of cash 
this was primarily due to longer collection times from our japanese customers 
also in  as our revenues declined our change in inventories represented a use of cash 
this was primarily due to increasing inventory related to new products and the slow down in the back end of the inspection business 
because of the lack of visibility in projected sales for  we are uncertain as to the level of expected cash to be provided from operating activities in net cash provided by operating activities in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  a decrease in inventories of million  an increase in other non current liabilities of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
the increase in receivables is primarily due to the timing of shipments towards the end of the year and longer collection times in japan 
during  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in other current liabilities of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million

in  net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of million  acquisition costs for business combinations of million  capital expenditures of million  costs incurred for capitalized software of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately within the range of million to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million 
from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses  products and or technologies 
we may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash 
on february   we announced that our merger with august technology corporation had been completed 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to former august technology shareholders 
on december   we announced that our acquisition of the semiconductor division of applied precision holdings  llc had been completed 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to applied precision holdings  llc 
on january   we announced that we had acquired all intellectual property and selected assets from privately held rvsi inspection  llc  headquartered in hauppauge  new york 
we paid cash for this acquisition and will account for it as a business combination 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations open and committed purchase orders total off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  business acquisitions  intangible assets  share based payments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting primarily of the sale of the product  software  installation and training services 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period 
revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of follow on support 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents business acquisitions 
we account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we normally utilize the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the purchase price is preliminarily allocated based on estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the final valuation of net assets is expected to be completed within one year from the acquisition or merger date 
at the acquisition or merger date  we begin to formulate a plan to exit or restructure certain activities  if applicable 
as we finalize our plans to exit or restructure activities  we may record additional liabilities for  among other things  severance and severance related costs  which would also increase the goodwill recorded 
goodwill 
our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is october st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
in fiscal  we changed our annual impairment testing date from december to october this change was made to allow us additional time to complete the impairment test by the end of the financial statement reporting deadline 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
the initial first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at october  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder 
we obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us 
we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value  we will also consider if  the market capitalization is temporarily low and  if so  we may also perform a discounted cash flow test 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
we believe our estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable 
as of december   a one dollar per share increase or decrease in our common stock would have a million effect on our market capitalization before adding a control premium 
testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such an event may occur if  for an extended period of time  the market value of our common stock plus the implied control premium were less than the carrying value 
should actual results not meet our expectations or assumptions change in future years  our impairment assessment could result in a lower fair value estimate which could result in an impairment charge that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and results from operations 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an 
table of contents asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for share based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million for a portion of deferred tax assets attributable to state r d tax credits and capital losses 
we adopted fasb financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  at the beginning of fiscal as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed by the interpretation 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized when effectively settled 
this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
table of contents of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  and the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements  which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for such arrangements 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions eitf  however  we do not anticipate that adoption will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reporting earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years that begin after november  our adoption of sfas is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which defers the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and non financial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
based on our current operations  we do not expect that the adoption of the non deferred portion of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of the deferred portion of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments us treasury and agency securities  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates  market 
table of contents liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates  market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore  china and korea and wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and japan 
our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies 
these foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material 
a substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of japan and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales 
substantially all our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations each reporting period 
as of december  and  we had fifteen and seventeen forward contracts outstanding  respectively 
the total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
