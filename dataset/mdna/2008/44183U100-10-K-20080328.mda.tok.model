item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general houston american energy was incorporated in april for the purposes of seeking oil and gas exploration and development prospects 
since inception  we have sought out prospects utilizing the expertise and business contacts of john f 
terwilliger  our founder and principal executive officer 
through the third quarter of  the acquisition targets were in the gulf coast region of texas and louisiana  where mr 
terwilliger has been involved in oil and gas exploration for over years 
in the fourth quarter  we initiated international efforts through a colombian joint venture more fully described below 
domestically and internationally  the strategy is to be a non operating partner with exploration and production companies that have much larger resources and operations 
overview of operations our operations are exclusively devoted to natural gas and oil exploration and production 
our focus  to date and for the foreseeable future  is the identification of oil and gas drilling prospects and participation in the drilling and production of prospects 
we typically identify prospects and assemble various drilling partners to participate in  and fund  drilling activities 
we may retain an interest in a prospect for our services in identifying and assembling prospects without any contribution on our part to drilling and completion costs or we may contribute to drilling and completion costs based on our proportionate interest in a prospect 
we derive our revenues from our interests in oil and gas production sold from prospects in which we own an interest  whether through royalty interests  working interest or other arrangements 
our revenues vary directly based on a combination of production volumes from wells in which we own an interest  market prices of oil and natural gas sold and our percentage interest in each prospect 
our well operating expenses vary depending upon the nature of our interest in each prospect 
we may bear no interest or a proportionate interest in the costs of drilling  completing and operating prospects on which we own an interest 
other than well drilling  completion and operating expenses  our principal operating expenses relate to our efforts to identify and secure prospects  comply with our various reporting obligations as a publicly held company and general overhead expenses 
business developments during drilling activities during  we drilled international wells in colombia  as follows wells were drilled on concessions in which we hold a working interest  of which was in production as of december   were temporarily shut in due to mechanical problems or weather conditions and were either dry holes or were ultimately abandoned  including well that was converted to a water disposal well 
wells were drilled on concessions in which we hold a working interest  of which were in production as of december  and were dry holes 
during  we drilled three domestic wells  of which was in production as of december   was a dry hole and was awaiting a pipeline connection before testing and completion 
at december   we had well in colombia being drilled and no domestic wells being drilled 
leasehold activity during  we acquired an interest in a acre prospect known as the caddo lake prospect in caddo parish  louisiana with a right to participate in drilling on an additional  acres 
we paid of the costs of the initial well drilled on the caddo lake prospect and have a working interest net revenue interest until well payout 
after well payout  we will own a working interest and net revenue interest 
on all additional well costs after the initial well and on all additional lease costs  we will have a working interest with a net revenue interest 
during  we relinquished interests in various leases in texas covering approximately gross acres and net acres and leases in louisiana covering approximately gross acres and net acres 
also during  a interest in our cara cara concession reverted to ecopetrol pursuant to the terms of the concession  reducing our interest in the concession from approximately to and resulting in an approximately  acre reduction in our net acreage in colombia 
seismic activity during  we conducted no new seismic activity 
possible sale of cara cara concession on july   our management was advised that hupecol llc had retained an investment bank for purposes of evaluating a possible transaction involving the monetization of hupecol assets 
pursuant to that engagement  in march  hupecol caracara llc  as owner operator under the caracara association contract  entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell all of its interest in the caracara association contract and related assets for a gross sale price of million  subject to certain closing adjustments based on oil price fluctuations and operations between the effective date of the sale  january   and the closing date 
pursuant to our investment in hupecol caracara llc  we hold a interest in the caracara assets being sold and will receive our proportionate interest in the net sale proceeds after deduction of commissions and transaction expenses 
completion of the sale of the caracara assets is subject to satisfaction of various conditions set out in the purchase and sale agreement  including the granting of all consents and approvals of the colombian governmental authorities required for the transfer of the assets to the purchaser 
hupecol tax allocation credits in august  we were advised that hupecol would be adjusting the division of interests among the members of the various hupecol entities to reflect revised colombian tax allocations among the various hupecol entities 
specifically  hupecol advised that colombian tax attributes were allocated among the hupecol entities without taking into account the specific contributions of each individual entity resulting in an improper shifting of tax expenses and benefits among the hupecol entities and  in turn  the members of each of the hupecol entities  including our company 
as a result of the adjustment by hupecol  during  we received a net credit from hupecol for excess colombian taxes allocated to us in the amount of  the credit is reflected in our financial statements as a credit to income tax expense 
corporate developments during  our compensation committee engaged a compensation consultant  as called for by the terms of employment of our chief financial officer  to review the compensation arrangements of our senior executives with a view to adjusting such compensation to reflect industry compensation practices 
following that review  the compensation committee approved increases in base salary of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  the payment of one time cash bonuses to each and the grant of shares of restricted stock to each  which grants are subject to approval of the same by our shareholders 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated at prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
excess costs are charged to proved properties impairment expense 
unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to depletable oil and gas properties 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
we record an allowance for impairment based on a review of present value of future cash flows 
any resulting charge is made to operations and reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the recorded asset 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and caption at december  at december  
del acquisition costs   evaluation costs   retention costs  total   del 
the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects include  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
subordinated convertible notes and warrants derivative financial instruments 
the subordinated convertible notes and warrants issued during have been accounted for in accordance with sfas and eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
we identified the following instruments and derivatives requiring evaluation and accounting under the relevant guidance applicable to financial derivatives subordinated convertible notes conversion feature conversion price reset feature company s optional redemption right warrants warrants exercise price reset feature we identified the conversion feature  the conversion price reset feature and our optional early redemption right within the convertible notes to represent embedded derivatives 
these embedded derivatives were bifurcated from their respective host debt contracts and accounted for as derivative liabilities in accordance with eitf the conversion feature  the conversion price reset feature and our optional early redemption right within the convertible notes were bundled together as a single hybrid compound instrument in accordance with sfas no 
derivatives implementation group implementation issue no 
b  embedded derivatives separate accounting for multiple derivative features embedded in a single hybrid instrument 
we identified the common stock warrant to be a detachable derivative 
the warrant exercise price reset provision was identified as an embedded derivative within the common stock warrant 
the common stock warrant and the embedded warrant exercise price reset provision were accounted for as a separate single hybrid compound instrument 
the single compound embedded derivatives within subordinated convertible notes and the derivative liability for warrants were recorded at fair value at the date of issuance may   and were marked to market each quarter with changes in fair value recorded to our income statement as net change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
we utilized a third party valuation firm to fair value the single compound embedded derivatives under the following methods a layered discounted probability weighted cash flow approach for the single compound embedded derivatives within subordinated convertible notes  and the black scholes model for the derivative liability for warrants based on a probability weighted exercise price 
the fair value of the derivative liabilities was subject to the changes in the trading value of our common stock 
as a result  our financial statements were subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter based on factors  such as the price of our stock at the balance sheet date  the amount of shares converted by note holders and or exercised by warrant holders 
consequently  our financial position and results of operations varied from quarter to quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenues and expenses 
in may  each of the subordinated convertible notes and warrants accounted for as derivative financial instruments was converted or exercised 
accordingly  for subsequent periods  we have no derivative financial instruments requiring account under sfas stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the vesting term  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues 
total oil and gas revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenue is due to a increased production resulting from the development of the colombian fields and b increases in oil and natural gas prices  partially offset by declines in us production 
we had interests in producing wells in colombia and producing wells in north america during as compared to producing wells in colombia and producing wells in north america during average prices from sales were per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas during as compared to per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas during following is a summary comparison  by region  of oil and gas sales for the periods

lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses  excluding joint venture expenses relating to our colombia operations discussed below  increased to  in from  in the increase in lease operating expenses was attributable to the increase in the number of wells operated during wells as compared to wells partially offset by improved operating efficiencies 
additionally operations have increased in workovers as well as in the dorotea and cabiona areas where we have a higher working interest  which increased the amount of operating expense we incurred during the period

depreciation and depletion expense 
depreciation and depletion expense increased by to  in fiscal when compared to  in the increase in depreciation and depletion expense was primarily attributable to increases in colombian production and an increase in the depletable cost pool 
impairment expense 
during  we recorded a provision for impairments of  all of which was attributable to our north american properties 
impairments related to the termination  during  of operations of seven wells in the us and the fact that  as of december   well testing had not yet been conducted on  and no reserves had been attributed to  the well drilled during on our caddo lake prospect 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense excluding stock based compensation increased by to  during from  in the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in salary to our president in mid  payment of a full year s salary to our chief financial officer hired during  increases in base salary of our president and chief financial officer during the third quarter of and payment of bonuses to our president and chief financial officer during stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses increased by to  in as compared to  in the increase in stock based compensation expense was attributable to the grant of stock options in connection with the hiring of our chief financial officer and the grants of options to our directors during other income  net

capital and exploration expenditures and commitments 
our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to our ongoing efforts to acquire  drill and complete prospects 
with the receipt of additional financing in and prior years  and the increase in our revenues and operating cash flows  we expect that future capital and exploration expenditures will be funded principally through funds on hand and funds generated from operations 
during  we invested  for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  primarily consisting of drilling of domestic wells  drilling wells in colombia  and lease retention payments on domestic properties 
at december   our only material contractual obligation requiring determinable future payments on our part was our lease relating to our executive offices

in addition to the contractual obligations requiring that we make fixed payments  in conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects  financing and services  we have  from time to time  granted overriding royalty interests orri in various properties  and may grant orris in the future  pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay a portion of our interest in revenues from various prospects to third parties 
planned drilling  leasehold and other activities 
as of december   we planned to drill a total of wells during  of which well is planned to be drilled on our domestic exploration projects and wells are planned to be drilled on our colombian exploration projects

additional wells are expected to be drilled at locations to be determined based on the results of the planned drilling projects 
our planned drilling activity is subject to change from time to time without notice 
in particular  we cannot predict the impact on our planned drilling activities in colombia of ongoing efforts by hupecol to monetize assets 
we also plan to selectively evaluate and acquire interests in additional drilling prospects 
at december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately  consisting of  for drilling of wells in colombia   for drilling of domestic well   for seismic operations in colombia  and  for road construction and facilities in colombia 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 
management anticipates that our current financial resources will meet our anticipated objectives and business operations  including our planned property acquisitions and drilling activities  for at least the next months without the need for additional capital 
management continues to evaluate producing property acquisitions as well as a number of drilling prospects 
it is possible  although not anticipated  that the company may require and seek additional financing if additional drilling prospects are pursued beyond those presently under consideration 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
interest rate risk we invest funds in excess of projected short term needs in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily fixed maturity securities 
while it is generally our intent to hold our fixed maturity securities to maturity  we have classified a majority of our fixed maturity portfolio as available for sale 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our available for sale fixed maturity securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity securities 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
because of the short term nature of the interest bearing investments  the quality of the issuers and the intent to hold those investments to maturity  we do not believe we face any material interest rate risk with respect to such investments
