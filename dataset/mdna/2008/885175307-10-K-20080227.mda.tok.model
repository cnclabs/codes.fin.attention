the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we are a leading manufacturer of mechanical circulatory support products for use by patients with hf 
our vads are used primarily by hf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart 
we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation  and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons and hf cardiologists worldwide  position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding hf market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary itc  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems and incision products that provide fast and accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
our business model our business is comprised of two operating divisions cardiovascular and itc 
the product line of our cardiovascular division is circulatory support products 
our mechanical circulatory support products include the pvad  ivad  heartmate xve  heartmate ii and centrimag for acute  intermediate and long term mechanical circulatory support for patients with advanced hf 
we also manufacture and sell small diameter grafts using our proprietary materials to address the vascular access market for hemodialysis 
the product lines of our itc division are point of care diagnostics 
our point of care products include diagnostic test systems that monitor blood coagulation while a patient is being administered certain anticoagulants  as well as monitor blood gas electrolytes  oxygenation and chemistry status 
incision 
our incision products include devices used to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing and screening for platelet function 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to  these policies and estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc divisions when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
we recognize revenue from sales of certain cardiovascular division products to first time customers when we have determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
the amount of revenue under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon the fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on behalf of the company by third party providers 
the amount of revenue allocated to cardiovascular products is made using the fair value method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the products based on the relative fair market values of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair values of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets could be significantly different  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 

table of contents reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales and training services 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
management must make judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if any of these management estimates proves incorrect  our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we adopted fin  on december   as a result of which our tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more likely than not threshold  and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
as a result of adopting fin  we reported a cumulative effect adjustment of million which increased our december  accumulated deficit balance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  on going tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
on december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  of which million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized 
an unrecognized tax benefit under fin is the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with the guidelines set forth in fin our unrecognized tax benefit was reduced by approximately million in to reflect the fin impact of a payment to the state of new jersey in settlement of a tax audit with respect to years through in addition  during  we filed tax returns in certain jurisdictions further decreasing our unrecognized tax benefit by approximately million 
it is reasonably possible that we will file or amend our tax returns in other jurisdictions in that will further decrease our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million 
on december  we had unrecognized tax benefit balance of million plus interest of million and penalties of million 
evaluation of purchased intangibles and goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  recoverability of assets to be held or used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  then the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows and the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheets could become significantly impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  such assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if there is an apparent impairment  a new fair value would be determined 
if the new fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
as of december   we do not believe that any of our long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired 

table of contents valuation of share based awards we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants is based on historical volatility 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated as a percentage of total product sales for the fiscal years ended product sales cost of product sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets purchased in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income and expense interest expense interest income and other income before taxes income tax expense benefit net income 
table of contents for the fiscal years and product sales product sales in increased to million compared to million in cardiovascular sales increased million and itc sales increased million 
product sales increases are due to an increase in volume unless otherwise noted 
the primary components of the total million increase in product sales were the following cardiovascular product sales increased by million  primarily due to increased sales of heartmate ii  partially offset by lower sales in our thoratec product line as a result of increased usage of short term devices 
in addition  a full year of product sales of centrimag in contributed to the overall increase in product sales as compared to the three month of sales in itc product sales increased million  primarily due to increased sales of our hospital point of care products along with increased sales of our alternate site and incision products resulting from market expansion and competitor product recalls 
in addition  product sales of avoximeters also contributed to the increase in sales in as opposed to only fourth quarter sales in sales originating outside of the united states and us export sales accounted for approximately and of our total product sales in and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit was million in as compared to million in as a percentage of product sales  gross margin was and for and  respectively 
gross margin included the following fluctuations cardiovascular gross margin decreased by due to unfavorable non pump product mix and manufacturing variances partially offset by improved foreign currency exchange from our international operations 
itc gross margin was the same for and  due to lower product costs offset by higher costs from product and geographic mix and the voluntary pro time recall charges 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  as compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following cardiovascular costs increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses in related to market expansion and preparation for heartmate ii commercial approval  unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an increase in share based compensation costs 
itc costs increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to higher personnel costs  consulting fees and increase in reserves for overdue accounts receivable 
in addition  in we incurred costs related to the avoximeter products for the full year as compared to selling costs incurred in for the fourth quarter only 
corporate costs increased by million in as compared to because of higher consulting and legal expenses related to the review of our stock option granting practices conducted during the first quarter of  market research and compliance costs 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase was comprised of million at our cardiovascular division and million at our itc division 
research and development costs are largely project driven and the level of spending depends on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
the increase in costs at our cardiovascular division was primarily due to regulatory and clinical costs associated with phase ii of the heartmate ii pivotal trial and heartmate ii product development 
the increase in costs at our itc division was primarily due to higher personnel and consulting costs related to new product development 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase is attributable to higher amortization of intangible costs from the acquisition of avox in october purchased in process research and development our in process research and development ipr d expenses were none in compared to million in ipr d costs from the acquisition of avox in october were expensed in because they related to technological projects that were in development  had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
litigation costs litigation charges in were none compared to million in the expenses in were primarily comprised of costs associated with a federal securities law putative class action  and a related shareholder derivative action 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the components include million and million in interest payments in and  respectively  and amortization of the debt issuance costs of million in both and  related to our senior subordinated convertible notes 
interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in  or a million increase 
interest income and other included million of interest income in as compared to million of interest income in the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and higher interest rates earned from these investments in as compared to in addition  foreign exchange gains increased by million from our hedging activities  we had a gain of million on a life insurance policy and royalty income increased by million in as compared to these increases were offset by a write down of an investment of million in and lower rental income of million in as compared to from the expiration of a sublease on a portion of our pleasanton headquarters in march income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to a benefit of in the increase in our annual effective tax rate of on a comparative basis was primarily due to a tax expense from our us tax return to provision true up recorded in  as compared to a tax benefit associated with this item in  the sunset of the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions in and reduced benefits from favorable foreign tax rates  all of which were only partially offset by increased tax advantaged income  the absence of any in process research and development write down for as compared to  and lower permanent deductions related to expensing of incentive stock options 
the effective rate benefit associated with the return to provision true up as compared to the tax expense recorded for this item in primarily resulted from increased research and development credit realization in our tax return 

table of contents for the fiscal years and product sales product sales in increased to million compared to million in the cardiovascular division increased sales by million and the itc division increased sales by million 
product sales increases are due to an increase in volume unless otherwise noted 
the primary components of the total million increase in product sales were the following cardiovascular product sales increased by million  primarily due to higher sales of our heartmate ii product line  partially offset by lower sales of our thoratec product line 
in addition  vectra product sales decreased by million  principally due to the recognition in of a payment received related to the modification of our distribution agreement with cr bard corporation of million 
itc product sales increased million  due primarily to increases in sales of our protime and hemochron products  as well as sales of avoximeter products in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our irma product 
in addition  incision product sales decreased million in as compared to sales originating outside of the united states and us export sales accounted for approximately and of our total product sales in and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit was million in as compared to million in gross margin as a percentage of product sales for and was and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the proportionate sales of itc versus cardiovascular products in conjunction with the following cardiovascular gross margin decreased by primarily due to recognition in of the payment received from the cr bard corporation for the modification of our distribution agreement as well as an unfavorable product mix in these decreases were partially offset by increased average selling prices 
itc gross margin decreased by  due to unfavorable product mix and manufacturing variances as well as increased freight costs 
costs related to share based compensation of million were recorded in and not in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  as compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following costs related to share based compensation of million were recorded in and none were recorded in cardiovascular costs increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses in related to the expansion of our sales force and marketing organization  marketing initiatives and management consulting services 
itc costs increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to higher personnel costs  rent  group purchasing organization fees and consulting costs related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning software erp system 
corporate costs increased by million in as compared to because of higher consulting and personnel costs  partially offset by lower ceo transition costs 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in of the million increase  million resulted from an increase in our stock based compensation expenses combined with increase in our cardiovascular and itc divisions of million and million  respectively  year over year 
the increased expense in the cardiovascular division was partially due to a one time charge of million related to the redirection of our heartmate iii program in december research and development costs are largely project driven  and the level of spending depends on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
the primary component of our research and development costs is employee salaries and benefits 
research and development costs also include regulatory and clinical costs associated with our compliance with fda regulations and clinical trials such as the phase ii heartmate ii pivotal trial 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase is attributable to higher amortization of intangible costs from the acquisition of avox in october and a change in business conditions that caused us to modify the remaining economic useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets under sfas no 
in january purchased in process research and development our in process research and development ipr d expenses in totaled million and none in ipr d costs from the acquisition of avox in october  were written off because they related to technological projects that were in development  had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
litigation costs litigation charges in were million compared to million in the expense in both years is primarily comprised of costs associated with a federal securities law putative class action  and a related shareholder derivative action 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the components include million and million in interest payments and million and million in amortization of the debt issuance costs  related to our senior subordinated convertible notes in and  respectively 
interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our investment portfolio based on increased average cash and investment balances and higher interest rates in compared with additionally  we received rental income of million from the sublease of a portion of our headquarters building in the first quarter of income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to an expense of in the decrease in our annual effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to a decrease in income before taxes  foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested outside the us and increases in tax advantaged interest income and research and development credits 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non deductible share based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of million  as well as cash taxes paid  purchases of property  plant and equipment and a strategic investment  partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans and from cash generated by operations 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
this amount included net income of million increased by positive non cash adjustments to net income of million primarily comprised of million for depreciation and amortization  million related to share based compensation expenses  and million of tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
these positive cash contributions were partially offset by a decrease of million related to excess tax benefits from share based compensation and a decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability 
changes in assets and liabilities used additional cash of million largely due to the increase in receivables  inventory and income tax receivable 

table of contents in  investing activities used million in cash  with million from the net purchase of investment securities  million from the purchase of property  plant and equipment  net  which includes million in build up of product inventory of drivers and demonstration equipment into fixed assets  and million in a strategic investment 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  and primarily was comprised of million from proceeds related to stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and million from excess tax benefits from share based compensation  partially offset by million of restricted stock for payment of income tax withholding due upon vesting 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
recent turmoil in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on debt and equity market activities including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there has not been a significant impact to our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during in addition  the impact of inflation on our financial position and the results of operations was not significant during any of the periods presented 
as of december   we owned approximately million of various tax exempt notes  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
even though the stated maturity dates of these auction rate securities may be one year or more beyond the balance sheet date  we have classified all auction rate securities as short term investments in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter a  working capital current assets and current liabilities  as they are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold during our normal operating cycle 
at february   we owned approximately million of various tax exempt notes  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
a majority of our auction rate securities are student loans substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  several auctions failed related to our auction rate securities and there is no assurance other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will experience successful auctions 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not and are instead required to hold the investment until a successful auction is held 
if the issuers are unable to successfully complete future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
notwithstanding our expectation that the auction rate securities market will return to normal and provide liquidity for these investments  it could conceivably take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit we maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
unless terminated by one of the parties  the letter of credit automatically renews on june of each year 
at december   our letter of credit balance was approximately  this letter of credit has not been drawn against 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c total a includes interest of million and original issue discount of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k related to our long term debt 
b our operating lease obligations of million were comprised of our various leased facilities and office equipment 
c our purchase obligations include million of supply agreements in effect at december  as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties and this liability is excluded from the table above 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

the fair value option is applied instrument by instrument with certain exceptions  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs and is applied only to an entire instrument 
if we measure eligible instruments using the fair value option  we would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront cost and fees associated with the instrument for which the fair value option is elected from and after january  we are currently evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements that this guidance will have on our results of operations or financial condition when we adopt sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our senior subordinated convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
as of february   we owned approximately million of various tax exempt notes  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
a majority of our auction rate securities are student loans substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  several auctions failed related to our auction rate securities and there is no assurance other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will experience successful auctions 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not and are instead required to hold the investment until a successful auction is held

foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our mechanical circulatory support products who report to our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of our cardiovascular division 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations stated in uk pounds are translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income loss 
the period end translation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds at the period end exchange rates result in foreign currency gains and losses  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations in interest income and other 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds 
these contracts typically have maturities of three months or less 
our financial instrument contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities and we valued these contracts at the estimated fair value at december  the change in fair value of the forward currency contracts is included in interest income and other  and offsets the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impacts of these foreign currency contracts are for the fiscal years ended in thousands foreign currency exchange losses on foreign currency contracts foreign currency exchange gains on foreign translation adjustments as of december   we had forward contracts to sell euros with a notional value of million and purchase uk pounds with a notional value of million  and as of december  we had forward contracts to sell euros with a notional value of million and purchase uk pounds with a notional value of million 
as of december   our forward contracts had an average exchange rate of one us dollar to euros and one us dollar to uk pounds 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million
