except as required by law  we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason 
overview we are the leading provider  based on revenues and market share  of software on demand  according to a july report by idc 
we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 
we were founded in february and began offering our on demand crm application service in february in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity  we will need to  among other things  continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition 
we plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally  hiring additional personnel  particularly in customer related areas  expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies  expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business  adding to our infrastructure to support our growth  and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business 
additionally  in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering  we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies 
we expect marketing and sales costs  which were percent of our total revenues for fiscal and percent for the same period a year ago  to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers  build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january references to fiscal  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended january  sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service  and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and related professional services and other revenues 
other revenues consist primarily of training fees 
subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues during fiscal subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service 
none of our customers accounted for more than percent of our revenues during fiscal  and subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
the typical subscription and support term is to months  although terms range from one to months 
our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable  though customers 
table of contents typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
we generally invoice our customers in advance  in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue  or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in general  we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training 
our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis 
we also offer a number of classes on implementing  using and administering our service that are billed on a per person  per class basis 
our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider a number of factors  which are described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
as we introduce new service offerings such as unlimited edition  partner edition and salesforce sandbox  we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements 
as a result  when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately  and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in such situations  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract 
approximately percent and percent of our total deferred revenue as of january  and respectively  related to deferred professional services revenue 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support  the costs of additional data center capacity  depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment  costs associated with website development activities  allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service 
we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount 
employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  including stock based expenses  the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services 
the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in a particular quarterly period 
for example  we have obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the united states and we intend to open a data center in asia in fiscal we expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service 
our proprietary  scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain multiple versions  which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 
we expect that in 
table of contents the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for our sales and marketing staff  including commissions  payments to partners  marketing programs and allocated overhead 
marketing programs consist of advertising  events  corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 
we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect that in the future  marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for finance and accounting  human resources and management information systems personnel  legal costs  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 
stock based expenses 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based expenses pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r which we adopted on february  sfas r requires that share based payments  including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods 
these charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
joint venture in december  we established a japanese joint venture  kabushiki kaisha salesforce 
com  with sunbridge  inc  a japanese corporation  to assist us with our sales efforts in japan 
as of january   we owned a percent interest in the joint venture 
because of this majority interest  we consolidate the venture s financial results  which are reflected in each revenue  cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations 
we then record minority interest  which reflects the minority investors interest in the venture s results  exclusive of intercompany charges 
through january   the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture has not been significant 
while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers  we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab and eitf we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract 
as part of their subscription agreements  customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 
consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable 
when accounted for separately  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts 
the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  such as an arrangement that includes subscription  premium support  consulting or training services  we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the nature of the consulting services  the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date  and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the consulting work 
if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
additionally  in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled  at january  and  at january  such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets 
accounting for deferred commissions 
we defer commission payments to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
the commission payments  which are paid in full the month after the customer s service commences  are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 
during fiscal  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
during the same period a year ago  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million at january  and million at january  
table of contents accounting for stock based awards 
we account for share based compensation under sfas r 
we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is the vesting term of four years 
we recognized stock based expense of million  or percent of revenue  during fiscal the requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations 
as of january   we had an aggregate of million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards 
we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january  and assumes no forfeiture activity 
we expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods 
we grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world 
in certain foreign jurisdictions  we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards 
pursuant to sfas r  we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise 
as of january   we would incur as an operating expense in excess of million for these taxes if all vested awards outstanding by employees in these foreign jurisdictions were exercised 
this amount is based on the number of vested awards held and the market price of our common stock as of january  the timing of when employees in these foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested awards could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period 
the impact of sfas r in the future is dependent upon  among other things  the timing of when we hire additional employees  the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees  the total number of stock awards granted  the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant  changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses 
additionally  the application of sfas r requires the use of an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
as of january   there were  restricted stock units outstanding 
we plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future 
the restricted stock units  which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit  have an exercise price of per share  which is equal to the par value of our common stock  and vest over years 
the fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant  and compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the tax expense or benefit for unusual items  or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates  certain non deductible expenses arising from sfas r and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities

the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal by million 
we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded to include more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally 
as described above  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services 
the timing of these additional expenses  as well as the costs related to our new data center in asia  will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues

at january   the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations facilities space computer equipment and furniture and fixtures contractual commitments our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million at january  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points could result in a million market value reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million
