in addition  we buy a considerable amount of precision machined engine components 
we believe that all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers 
research and development we refer to our research and development efforts as our ennovation program 
the goal of the program is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products 
ennovation incorporates a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization  and to identify  analyze  develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth 
an ennovation steering team comprised of engineering and marketing leaders coordinates and oversees our new product development efforts 
we employ scientists  engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop  design and test new and improved products 
we work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions 
the majority of our research and development expenditures are directed toward the development of new sealing products for hostile environments  the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems  the development of bearing products and materials with superior friction and wear characteristics  and the extension of our air compressor product line 
prior to introduction  new products are subject to extensive testing at our various facilities and at beta test sites in conjunction with our customers 

table of contents backlog at december   we had a backlog of orders valued at million compared with million at december  approximately of the backlog  mainly at fairbanks morse engine  is expected to be filled beyond backlog represents orders on hand that we believe to be firm 
however  there is no certainty that the backlog orders will in fact result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered 
in addition  for most of our business  backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality 
quality assurance we believe that product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong  long term relationships with our customers 
in order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers  we maintain stringent standards of quality control 
we routinely employ in process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development  design and production to ensure product quality and reliability 
these include state of the art cad cam equipment  statistical process control systems  laser tracking devices  failure mode and effect analysis and coordinate measuring machines 
we are also able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our cnc machinery 
in addition  we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource 
as a result  we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency  quality and reliability 
as of december   of our manufacturing facilities were iso  qs and or ts certified with the remaining facilities working towards obtaining iso and or ts certification 
twelve of our facilities are iso certified 
oems are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures and as a condition of awarding business 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property we maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the us and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these trademarks and patents 
we routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the us and other countries 
we also have proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets relating to the design  manufacture and operation of our products and their use that is not patented 
we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent  patent right  trademark  trade secret or license 
in general  we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell 
however  we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings 
we are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights 
in several cases  the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products 
for example  fairbanks morse engine licenses technology from man diesel for the four stroke reciprocating engine  and quincy compressor licenses from svenska rotor maskiner ab its rotary screw compressor design and technology 
a loss of these licenses or a failure on the part of the third party to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues 
although these licenses are all long term and subject to renewal  it is possible that we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or that they could be terminated for a material breach 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents employees and labor relations we currently have approximately  employees worldwide 
approximately  employees are located within the us and approximately  employees are located outside the us  primarily in europe  canada and mexico 
approximately of our us employees are members of trade unions covered by collective bargaining agreements 
union agreements relate  among other things  to wages  hours and conditions of employment 
the wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices 
we have collective bargaining agreements in place at five of our us facilities 
the hourly employees who are unionized are covered by collective bargaining agreements with a number of labor unions and with varying contract termination dates ranging from august to june in addition  some of our employees located outside the us are subject to national collective bargaining agreements 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terms 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally garlock sealing technologies llc and the anchor packing company  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing products  that contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers are actively managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd 
several risks and uncertainties may result in potential liabilities to us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following the potential for a large number of future asbestos claims that are not covered by insurance because insurance coverage is  or will be  depleted  the uncertainty of the per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims  the results of litigation and the success of our litigation and settlement strategies  the potential for large adverse judgments against us resulting from any required payments not covered by insurance and any surety appeal bonds and related cash collateral required in connection with appeals  
table of contents an increase in litigation costs  fees and expenses that are not covered by insurance  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them  the timing of claims  payments and insurance recoveries  and limitations imposed on the amount that may be recovered from insurance in any year  the unavailability of any insurance for claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after july   the potential for asbestos exposure to extend beyond specific coltec subsidiaries arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs  bankruptcies of other defendants  and the prospect for and impact of any federal legislation providing national asbestos litigation reform 
to the extent our subsidiaries insurance is depleted or the payments required in any given year exceed the annual limitations on insurance recoveries from our subsidiaries carriers  our subsidiaries would be required to fund these obligations from available cash 
this could adversely affect our ability to use cash for other purposes  including growth of our business  and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  our estimated liability for claims is highly uncertain and is based on subjective assumptions 
the actual liability could vary significantly from the estimate recorded in our financial statements 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of potential future asbestos claims  as well as the amount that will have to be paid to settle or satisfy any such claims in the future including significant bonds required by certain states while we appeal adverse verdicts  and the finite amount of insurance available for future payments  future asbestos claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for a further discussion of our asbestos exposure  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies asbestos 
our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and changes in general market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries  heavy duty trucking  semiconductor manufacturing  capital equipment and the automotive industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
economic downturns or other material weakness in demand in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our business 
customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs for raw materials or the termination of existing supply agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the prices for raw materials we purchase increased in while we have been successful in passing along a portion of these higher costs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers 
similarly  the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have some contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some instances  we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances  we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
specifically  we may potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to by central moloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec also has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
we have insurance  reserves and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate or the funds held in trust are insufficient  
table of contents environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing labor regulations  political and economic instability  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 

table of contents our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant affect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
in particular  reports concerning asbestos litigation or asbestos reform could cause a significant increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
we may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries future asbestos liability 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  payments related to asbestos litigation or annual costs related to asbestos litigation that are not covered by insurance  the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  
table of contents major changes in the level of economic activity in north america  europe  asia and other major regions in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the united states  and economic assumptions and market factors used to determine post retirement benefits and pension liabilities 
various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control 
the anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things  will require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms  if our board is expanded to nine members  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
our shareholder rights plan will also make an acquisition of a controlling interest in enpro in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our convertible debentures 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
in addition  a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of our convertible debentures 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price for our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the trading price of the debentures and the market price of our common stock 

table of contents absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
moreover  our current senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock if availability under the facility falls below million 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of companies with a history of paying regular dividends 
risks related to our capital structure our debt agreement imposes limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 
we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility that imposes limitations on our operations  such as limitations on distributions  limitations on incurrence and repayment of indebtedness  and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio 
these limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investment needs and or pursue business opportunities 
we may not have sufficient cash to repurchase our convertible debentures at the option of the holder or upon a change of control or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion 
upon a change of control  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding convertible debentures at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of debentures converted 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of tendered debentures or settlement of converted debentures 
any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the debentures may also limit our ability to use borrowings to pay any cash payable on a repurchase or conversion of the debentures and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our current million senior secured credit facility prohibits distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make payments of interest on the debentures if a default or event of default exists under the facility 
our senior secured credit facility also prohibits prepayments of the debentures or distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make principal payments or payments upon conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default exists under the facility or the amount of the borrowing base under the facility  less the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facility and letters of credit and reserves  is less than million 
our failure to repurchase tendered debentures at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the debentures would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the change of control itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the debentures or make cash payments upon conversion thereof

overview overview 
enpro is a leader in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of proprietary engineered industrial products 
we have primary manufacturing facilities located in the united states and countries outside the united states 
we focus on four management initiatives improving operational efficiencies through our total customer value  or tcv  lean enterprise program  expanding our product offerings and customer base through our ennovation initiative and new operations in new geographic markets  strengthening the mix of our business by strategic acquisitions and divestitures  and managing the asbestos settlements of our subsidiaries to minimize the impact on cash flows and enhance our liquidity 
we believe these strategic initiatives will increase our sales growth  increase our gross profit  provide additional earnings leverage over time through reduced manufacturing  selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue  increase our income from continuing operations  and provide the cash required to sustain and grow the company 
we manage our business as three segments a sealing products segment  an engineered products segment  and an engine products and services segment 
our sealing products segment designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including metallic  non metallic and composite material gaskets  rotary seals  compression packing  resilient metal seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components and expansion joints  as well as wheel end component 
table of contents systems  ptfe products  conveyor belting and sheeted rubber products 
these products are used in a variety of industries  including chemical and petrochemical processing  petroleum extraction and refining  pulp and paper processing  heavy duty trucking  power generation  food and pharmaceutical processing  primary metal manufacturing  mining  water and waste treatment and semiconductor fabrication 
our engineered products segment includes operations that design  manufacture and sell self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer bearings  filament wound solid polymer bearings  aluminum blocks for hydraulic applications  rotary and reciprocating air compressors  vacuum pumps  air systems and reciprocating compressor components 
these products are used in a wide range of applications  including the automotive  pharmaceutical  pulp and paper  gas transmission  health  construction  petrochemical and general industrial markets 
on july   we acquired compressor products international ltd 
and combined its operations with the operations of france compressor products in the engineered products segment 
beginning in may  we completed four smaller acquisitions for france compressor products 
the four are allwest compressor services  southwest compressor services  har compressor products and texflo machining ltd 
this combination of companies created the world s leading manufacturer of reciprocating compressor components and one of the world s largest producers of reciprocating compressor valves 
to accurately reflect the combined company s products  international presence and objectives for growth  these operations conduct business under the compressor products international brand name 
we now refer to these operations as compressor products international  or cpi 
our engine products and services segment designs  manufactures  sells and services heavy duty  medium speed diesel  natural gas and dual fuel reciprocating engines 
the united states government and general market for marine propulsion  power generation  and pump and compressor applications use these products and services 
as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we actively manage the asbestos claims against our subsidiaries and have a sizeable amount of insurance remaining for the payment of these claims 
we accrue an estimated liability for both pending and future asbestos claims for the next ten years 
for additional information on this subject  see contingencies asbestos 
outlook we continue to make progress in connection with our strategies to improve operating efficiency through our tcv initiative  to expand our product offerings  our markets  and our customer base  to strengthen the mix of our businesses  and to manage asbestos settlements by our subsidiaries 
our strong liquidity  cash flows and relatively low debt ratio provide us with a sound financial base upon which we can continue to grow the company 
we expect sales to increase in compared to  mainly because of improved volumes from market share gained as a result of new products and geographic expansion  market growth  full year results associated with the acquisitions completed in  and price increases 
we expect higher sales volumes  productivity improvements and restructuring initiatives associated with our tcv lean manufacturing program  continued focus on low cost manufacturing operations  and price increases to contribute to operating margins and increased operating profits in improvements in operating margins may be offset  in whole or in part  by the effect of the acquisition of operations with operating margins less than our existing businesses primarily due to amortization of the intangible assets of the acquired operations 
we expect gross profit will continue to 
table of contents increase as a result of acquisitions  but operating margins may increase  be flat or decline depending on the operating margins of the acquired operations and their proportion of our total results 
we anticipate that cash flows in will benefit from improved operating income partially offset by increases in capital expenditures and net asbestos related payments 
capital spending in is expected to be higher than levels as a result of continued investments to expand geographically  and our strategy to improve operational efficiency 
net asbestos related payments are expected to increase in because we expect to collect significantly less from our insurance than in as part of our operating strategy to strengthen our mix of businesses  we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and divestitures in  however  the impact of such acquisitions or divestitures cannot be predicted and therefore is not reflected in this outlook

table of contents compared to sales were billion in  a new record and an increase compared to the million recorded in increases in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with the euro being the most significant  and acquisitions completed in added approximately six percentage points to revenue growth on a year over year basis 
the five percentage points of organic growth were the result of stronger demand from garlock sealing technologies us and european markets  higher shipments from ggb s european operations  continued strong demand in the energy related markets of compressor products international  increased engine and parts shipments from fairbanks morse engine  and selected price increases at several businesses 
these favorable variances were partially offset by lower oem and aftermarket volumes in stemco s heavy duty truck market  a drop in demand for plastomer technologies products in the semiconductor and industrial markets  and a small decrease in shipments from quincy compressor  coming off of a strong year in  for key markets such as energy  industrial and contractors 
segment profit  one of management s primary measures of how our operations perform  increased from million in to million in segment profit was impacted by selected price increases and increased sales volume at several businesses  improved margins on fairbanks morse engine shipments  a contract loss provision for fairbanks morse engine in that did not recur this year  a reduction in us defined benefit pension expense  contributions from acquisitions  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the defined benefit pension expense declined because amendments to our us salaried defined benefit plan implemented in the first quarter of lowered service costs and because returns on pension assets improved 
despite the lower demand experienced by quincy compressor and garlock rubber technologies  each contributed to the year over year increase in segment profit as a result of cost savings and price increases 
volume declines at stemco and plastomer technologies and an increase in restructuring expenses in partially offset the favorable affects of the previously mentioned items 
restructuring expenses in were million compared to million in the restructuring costs in each year were primarily for the modernization project at the garlock sealing technologies facilities in palmyra  new york 
segment margins  defined as segment profit divided by sales  increased from in to in asbestos expenses in were million and included net cash outlays of million for legal fees and expenses incurred during the year and million in non cash charges to maintain a ten year liability estimate for future claims and to reflect an adjustment to our internal estimate of the liability 
in  asbestos expenses were million 
the higher expense in was primarily the result of an adjustment we made to record the asbestos liability at a point that we believe to be the best estimate within our outside expert s range of equally likely estimates for the next ten years 
for a further discussion of asbestos expenses  see contingencies asbestos 
net interest income in was million compared to net interest expense of million last year 
the net interest income was a result of the increase in invested cash balances while the yield on those funds was essentially flat 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in the decrease in the rate for was principally due to the effect on our deferred tax balances of the enactment of reduced income and trade tax rates in germany 
this was partially offset by an unfavorable change in the mix of foreign and us state and local taxable income 
in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of million of taxes  related to the acquisition of the outstanding shares of a subsidiary held by minority shareholders 

table of contents following is a discussion of operating results for each segment during the year sealing products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in the favorable impact of the euro accounted for three percentage points of the growth 
sales at garlock sealing technologies benefited from increased demand in its european markets  continued strength in the oil and gas sector  selected price increases and the stronger euro 
aftermarket and oem sales decreased at stemco due to lower demand in the us heavy duty truck market 
fewer new trucks and trailers were built as usage of existing trucks declined 
a decline in sales to plastomer technologies semiconductor market partially offset the increase attributable to including the amicon business  acquired in july  for a full year in segment profit increased by from million in to million in profits at garlock sealing technologies benefited from higher volumes and selected price increases 
these benefits were partially offset by increased restructuring costs for the modernization project at the garlock sealing technologies facilities in palmyra  ny and additional spending in marketing  business development and r d 
stemco reported a decline in profit in connection with its sales decrease and increased costs  but the decline was partially mitigated by price increases 
garlock rubber technologies increased its profit significantly in by focusing on cost reductions that increased operating margins 
lower volumes negatively impacted plastomer technologies results  as did increased restructuring expenses for the reorganization of its facilities 
segment margins decreased from in to in engineered products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in the increase in the value of the euro and the acquisitions completed in favorably impacted revenue by eleven percentage points when compared to sales for compressor products international were higher in due to the additional volume from the acquisitions completed in and and increased activity in its north american and european markets 
in  ggb benefited from the favorable euro exchange rate and increased volume in europe 
quincy compressor s sales were below the record levels of as demand declined in energy and construction markets 
segment profits of million in were higher than the million reported in ggb s profits increased in  when compared to  due to higher volumes  a stronger euro and selected price increases 
profits at compressor products international improved principally as a result of the acquisitions and selected price increases 
however  amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions resulted in lower operating margins at both cpi and the segment 
despite the decline in revenue  quincy compressor was able to increase its profitability slightly as a result of price increases and cost reductions 
segment margins were essentially flat at in and in engine products and services 
sales increased from the million reported in to million in about half of the increase was attributable to additional engine and related parts shipments for us navy shipbuilding programs with the other half from sales of aftermarket parts and service and selected price increases 
the segment reported a profit of million in compared to million in the year over year improvement was a result of better margins on engine shipments  an increase in parts shipments  which have better margins than engine sales  net cost savings in manufacturing and administration expenses  and a million contract loss on a us navy engine program recorded in segment margins in were compared to in 
table of contents compared to sales increased from million in to million in sales in were favorably impacted by increased demand in garlock sealing technologies markets and increased activity in stemco s heavy duty truck market 
sales in also benefited from strong market demand and new product introductions at quincy compressor  increased activities in the industrial markets of ggb europe and the automotive markets of ggb americas  and higher value engine shipments at fairbanks morse engine 
additionally  the acquisitions completed earlier in the year and favorable foreign currency rates accounted for two percentage points of the sales increase in segment profit  one of management s primary measures of how our operations performed during the year  increased from million in to million in higher volumes  price increases and cost reduction initiatives associated with our tcv program contributed to higher profitability in these favorable variances were partially offset by lower segment profit at garlock rubber technologies due to productivity issues and lower aftermarket sales at fairbanks morse engine 
segment margins were in compared to in corporate expenses for were million compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of higher achievement levels associated with performance based compensation in asbestos expenses in were million  compared to million in the increase in was primarily the result of a revision to our estimated asbestos liability 
previously  we had recorded the liability at the low end of a broad ten year range of equally likely estimates provided by an outside expert 
in the fourth quarter of  based on our experience over the last two years  we identified a best estimate within the expert s range and adjusted the liability accordingly 
as a result  the estimated liability recorded at december  was million 
for additional information on this subject  see contingencies asbestos in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net interest expense for the year ending december  was million  compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense in was a result of lower interest rates associated with our convertible debt financing completed in the second half of  as well as an increase in interest income in associated with higher short term interest rates 
other income  net for was million compared to an expense of million in the results in benefited from the receipt of million associated with excess assets in a trust that was established for a divested business and a reduction in liabilities due to the dismissal of product liability and indemnity lawsuits associated with a previously owned subsidiary 
our effective tax rate for the year ending december  was  compared to in the increase in was largely due to a change in the mix of our pre tax earnings between the us and non us jurisdictions 
the net loss for was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in the decline was the result of the asbestos charge recorded in the fourth quarter of earnings per share are expressed on a diluted basis 
following is a discussion of the operating results for each segment 

table of contents sealing products 
sales increased for the year ending december  to million from million in sales at stemco increased as original equipment demand in the heavy duty truck market exceeded prior year requirements and aftermarket activity improved compared to sales at garlock sealing technologies increased in due to higher demand and selected price increases in its major markets  including the oil and gas and power generation markets 
plastomer technologies benefited from increased demand in sheet products  machined components  and the incremental revenue from the amicon acquisition completed early in the third quarter of segment profit increased from million in to million for the year ending december  profits at garlock sealing technologies were favorably impacted by higher volumes and selected price increases  partially offset by charges for the modernization project at the palmyra  new york facility 
plastomer technologies profit increased as a result of higher demand and the accretive impact of the amicon acquisition 
stemco s profit in was favorably impacted by increased volumes and selected price increases  partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing costs  while garlock rubber technologies profit was negatively impacted by lower productivity 
segment margins increased from in to in engineered products 
sales of million for the year ending december  were higher than the million reported in sales volumes at quincy compressor were significantly higher in as a result of strength in its us markets and new product introductions 
sales increased at ggb in due to higher volumes in the industrial markets of europe and increased automotive demand in the americas 
sales at france compressor products exceeded levels due to higher volumes in europe and the favorable impact associated with the allwest acquisition completed in the second quarter of segment profits were million for the year ending december   or higher than the million reported in profits at quincy compressor increased as a result of higher sales volume  selected price increases and cost reduction initiatives 
ggb s profits increased in due to higher volumes  improved operating efficiencies at its slovakian manufacturing facility and cost reduction initiatives associated with our tcv program 
profits at france compressor products exceeded levels as a result of higher volumes in europe  selected price increases and the favorable impact associated with the allwest acquisition 
segment margins increased from in to in engine products and services 
sales in were million  compared to million in higher revenue associated with us navy shipbuilding programs contributed to the increase in however  this increase was partially offset by lower parts and service revenue 
the segment reported a profit of million in  compared to a profit of million in the results in were impacted by an unfavorable product mix associated with lower aftermarket and service revenue 
results in also include a loss contract charge of million while a loss contract charge of million was recorded in segment margins in were  compared to in restructuring and other costs restructuring expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the expense in all three years was primarily related to restructuring activities associated with the modernization project at our garlock sealing technologies manufacturing facilities in palmyra  new york 
garlock sealing technologies has been on its current site since the early s  with buildings dating from to the project  which is ongoing  will reduce the number of buildings on the site from to and eliminate approximately  square feet of space  or approximately half 
table of contents of the space under roof at the beginning of the project 
the modernization will be completed over five years at an expected cost  including expenses and capital expenditures  of approximately million  excluding the impact of economic development grants  tax abatements and tax credits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring and other costs in each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview and significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical 
some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time title and risk of ownership is transferred or when services are rendered 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue and expensed in cost of goods sold 
asbestos in and the first three quarters of  we recorded a liability related to asbestos claims at the low end of a broad ten year range of equally likely estimates provided by the firm of bates white  llc bates white  a recognized expert in the field of estimating asbestos related liabilities 
due to the uncertain nature of the estimated liability  we and bates white believed that no single amount in the range was a better estimate than any other amount in the range 
in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  we recorded a liability for these claims at the low end of the range of estimated potential liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of  based on our experience during the preceding two years and other factors  we identified a best estimate within the bates white range and adjusted the liability accordingly 
the significant assumptions underlying the material components of the estimated liability include the number and trend of claims to be asserted  the mix of alleged diseases or impairment  the trend in the number of claims for non malignant cases  the probability that some existing and potential future claims will eventually be dismissed without payment  the estimated amount to be paid per claim  and the timing and impact of large amounts that will become available for the payment of claims from the g trusts of former defendants in bankruptcy 
the actual number of future actions filed per year and the payments made to resolve those claims could exceed those reflected in our estimate 
with the assistance of bates white  we periodically review the period over which we can make a reasonable estimate  the assumptions underlying our estimate  the range of reasonably possible potential liabilities and management s estimate of the liability  and we adjust the liability if necessary 
changing circumstances and new data that may become available could cause a change in the estimated liability in 
table of contents the future by an amount that cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant and material 
additional discussion is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies asbestos 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of our operations whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated into us dollars using the current rate method 
under this method  all assets and liabilities are translated in us dollars using current exchange rates  and income statement activities are translated using weighted average exchange rates 
the foreign currency translation adjustment is reflected in our consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have entered into contracts to hedge forecasted transactions occurring at various dates through december that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the contracts is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is reported in income 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into income in the period when the hedged transactions occur 
pensions and postretirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax and book basis of an asset or liability are used to compute future tax assets or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income losses in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and the expected effects on results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  if any 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows operating activities provided million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  operating cash flows increased from the prior year chiefly as a result of higher net earnings  lower net asbestos payments and a decrease in working capital levels compared to these improvements were partially offset by an increase in payments for environmental remediation activities in  which were included in the change in other noncurrent assets and liabilities 
in  working capital increased primarily due to higher inventories and customer receivables at several of our operations 
inventory levels were higher in primarily due to higher material requirements for engine programs at fairbanks morse engine 
although the working capital was impacted by an increase in accounts receivable relating to increased sales activity  the days sales outstanding for receivables remained constant on a year over year basis at days 
payments for asbestos related claims and expenses  net of insurance recoveries  were million in compared to million in investing cash flows we used million  million and million in investing activities in  and  respectively 
investing activities in and included net payments of million and million  respectively  associated with acquisitions  primarily related to the newly constituted compressor products international 
our investing activities in also included capital expenditures of million associated with our manufacturing facilities  compared to million in and million in the increases in capital expenditures in and reflected spending associated with the modernization activities at our manufacturing facilities in palmyra  new york and our continued strategy to expand geographically and to increase investments in our operations as part of an effort to improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs 
the results in were impacted by the reclassification of million of unrestricted cash balances to other current and noncurrent assets based on changes in expected maturity dates of the underlying investments 
the results in were impacted by a million reclassification of unrestricted cash balances to restricted cash balances as a result of posting cash collateral required to secure bonds associated with adverse asbestos verdicts on appeal 
the results benefited from the reclassification of million from restricted cash to unrestricted cash due to the resolution of several verdicts on appeal 
financing cash flows financing activities provided million and million  respectively  in and  and used million in cash in financing cash flows in included proceeds from the sale of million of our convertible debentures 
we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from this sale to redeem the million of outstanding convertible preferred securities term income deferred equity securities  or tides 
we also used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to enter into hedge and warrant transactions  which will reduce potential dilution of our common stock from the conversion of the debentures by increasing their effective conversion price 
debt issuance costs associated with this transaction were million and are being amortized over the term of the debentures 
subsequent to the debenture offering  we sold our goodrich call options and received proceeds of million which is included in net cash used in investing activities described above 
capital resources our primary us operating subsidiaries have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which matures on april  we have not borrowed against this facility 
the 
table of contents facility is collateralized by our receivables  inventories  intellectual property  insurance receivables and all other personal property assets other than fixed assets  and by pledges of of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries and of the capital stock of our direct and indirect us subsidiaries 
the facility contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for an asset based loan  including limitations on dividends  limitations on incurrence and repayment of indebtedness and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio 
certain of the covenants and restrictions apply only if availability under the facility falls below certain levels 
the maximum initial amount available for borrowings under the facility is million 
under certain conditions  the borrowers may request that the facility be increased by up to million  to million in total 
actual borrowing availability at any date is determined by reference to a borrowing base of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and is reduced by usage of the facility including outstanding letters of credit and any reserves 
the actual borrowing availability at december   under our senior secured revolving credit facility was million 
the borrowing availability was less than the full amount of the facility because the borrowing base was less than the facility limit at december  we issued million of convertible debentures in the debentures bear interest at an annual rate of  and we pay accrued interest on april and october of each year 
the debentures will mature on october  the debentures are direct  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
they effectively rank junior to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the debentures do not contain any financial covenants 
holders may convert the debentures into cash and shares of our common stock  if any  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures which is equal to an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  before the close of business on october  upon conversion  we would deliver i cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted or our total conversion obligation  and ii shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
conversion is permitted only under certain circumstances that had not occurred at december  additional discussion regarding the convertible debentures is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to enter into call options hedge and warrant transactions  which entitle us to purchase shares of our stock from a financial institution at per share and entitle the financial institution to purchase shares of our stock from us at per share 
this will reduce potential dilution to our common stock from conversion of the debentures and have the effect to us of increasing the conversion price of the debentures to per share 
dividends to date  we have not paid dividends 
if availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility falls below million  we would be limited in our ability to pay dividends 
the indenture that governs the convertible debentures does not restrict us from paying dividends 
contingencies general various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  all arising in the ordinary course of business  are pending or 
table of contents threatened against us or our subsidiaries and seek monetary damages and or other remedies 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are also involved as plaintiffs in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection  environmental  insurance and other matters 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach in our efforts to comply with all environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we also regularly conduct comprehensive environmental  health and safety audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 
although we believe past operations were in substantial compliance with the then applicable regulations  we or one of our subsidiaries have been named as a potentially responsible party  or are otherwise involved  at sites where the costs to us are expected to exceed  investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at the other six sites 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that were sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater contamination 
as of december  and  enpro had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  for estimated future expenditures relating to environmental contingencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our environmental contingencies 
colt firearms and central moloney we have contingent liabilities related to divested businesses for which certain of our subsidiaries retained liability or are obligated under indemnity agreements 
these contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  potential product liability and associated claims related to coltec s former colt firearms subsidiary for firearms manufactured prior to its divestiture in and coltec s former central moloney subsidiary for electrical transformers manufactured prior to its divestiture in no product liability claims are currently pending against coltec related to colt firearms or central moloney 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in our consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of these operations

asbestos history 
certain of our subsidiaries  primarily garlock sealing technologies llc garlock and the anchor packing company anchor  are among a large number of defendants in actions filed in various states by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
among the products at issue in these actions are industrial sealing products  including gaskets and packing products 
since the first asbestos related lawsuits were filed against garlock in  garlock and anchor have processed approximately  asbestos claims to conclusion including judgments  settlements and dismissals and  together with their insurers  have paid approximately billion in settlements and judgments and over million in fees and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the disease mix in the claims  new claims recently filed  product defenses asserted by our subsidiaries  recent trial and appeal results  and settlements 
status of anchor 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor 
anchor has no remaining assets and has not committed to settle any actions since as cases reach the trial stage  anchor is typically dismissed without payment 
insurance coverage 
at december   garlock had available million of solvent insurance and trust coverage that we believe will be available to cover future asbestos claims and certain expense payments 
in addition  at december   garlock classified million of otherwise available insurance as insolvent 
we believe that garlock will recover some of the insolvent insurance over time 
in fact  garlock collected approximately million from insolvent carriers in  bringing total collections from insolvent carriers from through to approximately million 
there can be no assurance that garlock will collect any of the remaining insolvent insurance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the quality of garlock s insurance  arrangements for payments with certain insurers  the resolution of past insurance disputes  and coverage exclusions for exposure after july  our liability estimate 
prior to mid  we maintained that our subsidiaries liability for unasserted claims was not reasonably estimable 
we estimated and recorded liabilities only for pending claims in advanced stages of processing  for which we believed we had a basis for making a reasonable estimate 
we disclosed the significance of the total potential liability for unasserted claims in considerable detail 
by  however  most asbestos defendants who disclose their liabilities were recording estimates of their liabilities for pending and unasserted claims 
in view of the change in practice by other defendants  during we authorized counsel to retain a recognized expert to assist in estimating our subsidiaries liability for pending and future asbestos claims 
after interviewing and qualifying several recognized experts with us  counsel selected bates white 
bates white s first report  dated february   provided an estimate of the liability as of december  for the following ten years  which represented a time horizon within which bates white believed such liability was both probable and estimable within a range of values 
bates white opined that each value within the range of million to million was an equally likely estimate of the liability 
we adopted the bates white estimate and  accordingly  recorded an additional liability for pending and unasserted claims as of december  to increase our liability to an amount equal to the low end of the estimated range million 
the recording of such increased asbestos liability resulted in our also recording an increase to our insurance receivable 

table of contents bates white has updated its estimate every quarter since the end of the estimated range of potential liabilities provided by bates white at december  was million to million 
according to bates white  increases have been attributable primarily to an increase in settlement values of mesothelioma claims  an increase in claims filings and values in some jurisdictions  most notably california  and the delay in  and uncertain impact of  the funding and implementation of trusts formed under section g of the united states bankruptcy code to pay asbestos claims against numerous defendants in chapter reorganization cases 
because the g trusts are estimated to have more than billion that will be available for the payment of asbestos claims  they could have a significant impact on our future settlement payments and could therefore significantly affect our liability 
each quarter until the fourth quarter of  we adopted the bates white estimate and adjusted the liability to equal the low end of the then current range 
until the second quarter of  the additional liability was recorded with a corresponding increase in our insurance receivable  and thus did not affect net income 
during the second quarter of  however  our insurance was fully allocated to past  present and future claims  and therefore subsequent changes to the bates white estimate were recorded as charges to income 
we have independently developed internal estimates for asbestos related liabilities 
we have used those estimates for a variety of purposes  including guidance for settlement negotiations and trial strategy  in our strategic planning  budgeting and cash flow planning processes  and in setting targets for annual and long term incentive compensation 
until the end of  we did not have sufficient history comparing claims payments to our internal estimates to allow us to identify a most likely point within the bates white range 
therefore  prior to the fourth quarter of  we had adopted the low end of the range provided by bates white 
however  our internal estimate has been within the bates white range of equally likely estimates and has proven to be a more precise predictor of the actual amounts spent on settlements and verdicts than the low end of the range 
as a result  while the low end of the bates white range still provides a reasonable lower boundary of possible outcomes  bates white and management believe that our internal estimate for the next ten years represents the most likely point within the range 
accordingly  we adjusted the recorded liability from the low end of the bates white estimate to our point estimate in the fourth quarter of and have adjusted the liability in each subsequent quarter consistent with our internal estimate 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to reflect our estimate 
we focus on future cash flows to prepare our estimate 
we make assumptions about declining future asbestos spending based on past trends  publicly available epidemiological data  current agreements with plaintiff firms and our judgment about the current and future litigation environment  the availability to claimants of other payment sources  both co defendants and the g trusts  and the input and insight provided to us by bates white 
we adjust our estimate when current cash flow results and long term trends suggest that our targets cannot be met 
as a result  we have a process that we believe produces the best estimate of the future liability for the ten year time period within the bates white range 
we currently estimate that the liability of our subsidiaries for the indemnity cost of resolving asbestos claims for the next ten years will be million 
the estimated liability of million is before any tax benefit and is not discounted to present value  and it does not include fees and expenses  which are recorded as incurred 
the recorded liability will continue to be impacted by our actual claims and settlement experience and any change in the legal environment that could cause a significant increase or decrease in the long term expectations of management and bates white 
we expect the recorded liability to fluctuate  perhaps significantly 
any significant change in the estimated liability could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents although we believe that our estimate is the best estimate within the bates white range of reasonable and probable estimates of garlock s future obligation  we note that bates white also indicated a broader range of potential estimates from million to million 
we caution that points within that broader range remain possible outcomes 
also  while we agree with our expert that beyond two to four years for garlock s economically driven non malignant claims and beyond ten years for garlock s cancer claims and medically driven non malignant claims  there are reasonable scenarios in which the 
asbestos 
expenditure is de minimus  we caution that the process of estimating future liabilities is highly uncertain 
adjusting our liability to the best estimate within the range does not change that fact 
in the words of the bates white report  the reliability of estimates of future probable expenditures of garlock for asbestos related personal injury claims declines significantly for each year further into the future 
scenarios continue to exist that could result in a total future asbestos liability for garlock in excess of billion 
as previously mentioned  the liability estimate does not include legal fees and expenses  which add considerably to the costs each year 
over the last two years  these expenses have averaged approximately million per quarter 
in addition to these legal fees and expenses  we expect to continue to record charges to income in future quarters for increases  if any  in our estimate of garlock s potential liability  plus increases  if any  that result from additional quarters added to maintain the ten year estimation period increases of this type have averaged approximately million per quarter for the last two years  plus amounts  if any  of solvent insurance lost or commuted  offset by insolvent recoveries and earnings from insurance settlement trusts 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge to income of million to reflect net cash outlays of million for legal fees and expenses incurred during the year  and a million non cash charge 
the non cash charge included million related to the addition of periods to maintain a ten year liability estimate and million to adjust the liability based on revisions to management s estimate 
a portion of the non cash charge million resulted from adjustments made to management s estimation model in the fourth quarter of we made this adjustment based on our review of negotiations and payment trends and our belief that it is more likely that  in the future  a higher percentage of settlement commitments made in any year will also be paid in that same year 
quantitative claims and insurance information 
our liability as of december  was million our estimate of the liability described above of million plus million of accrued legal and other fees already incurred but not yet paid 
the total liability as of december   included million classified as a current liability and million classified as a noncurrent liability 
the recorded amounts do not include legal fees and expenses to be incurred in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about pending cases  insurance  cash flows and our liability 
strategy 
garlock s strategy is to focus on trial listed cases and other cases in advanced stages  to reduce new settlement commitments each year  to carefully manage and maximize insurance collections  and to proactively support legislative and other efforts aimed at meaningful asbestos reform 
we believe that this strategy should result in the continued reduction of the negative annual cash flow impact from asbestos claims 
however  the risk of large verdicts sometimes impacts the implementation of the strategy  and therefore it is likely that  from time to time  garlock will enter into settlements that involve large numbers of cases  including early stage cases  when it believes that the risk outweighs the benefits of the strategy 
we believe that  as predicted in various epidemiological studies that are publicly 
table of contents available  the incidence of asbestos related disease is in decline and should continue to decline steadily over the next decade and thereafter  so that claims activity against garlock will eventually decline to a level that can be paid from the cash flow expected from garlock s operations  even after garlock exhausts its insurance coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that epidemiological predictions about incidence of asbestos related disease will prove to be accurate  or that  even if they are  there will be a commensurate decline in the number of asbestos related claims filings 
considering the foregoing  as well as the experience of our subsidiaries and other defendants in asbestos litigation  the likely sharing of judgments among multiple responsible defendants  bankruptcies of other defendants  and legislative efforts  and given the amount of insurance coverage available to our subsidiaries from solvent insurance carriers  we believe that pending asbestos actions against our subsidiaries are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in given future periods 
we anticipate that asbestos claims will continue to be filed against our subsidiaries 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of potential future claims and the amount that will have to be paid to litigate  settle or satisfy claims  and the finite amount of insurance available for future payments  future claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reform legislation 
while reform measures have been adopted in several states and are likely to be considered from time to time on a state by state basis in a number of other jurisdictions  the outlook for federal legislation to provide national asbestos litigation reform continues to be uncertain 
while reform legislation ultimately may be adopted by the us congress  it appears unlikely that any federal asbestos legislation will be enacted in the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements lease agreements we have several operating leases primarily for real estate  equipment and vehicles 
operating lease arrangements are generally utilized to secure the use of assets from time to time if the terms and conditions of the lease or the nature of the asset makes the lease arrangement more favorable than a purchase 
as of december   approximately million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these agreements 
see note  commitments and contingencies other commitments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
debt and capital lease guarantees at december   we have outstanding contingent liabilities for guaranteed debt and lease payments of million related to previously divested businesses

table of contents payments due by period in millions less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total payment for long term debt may be accelerated under certain circumstances because the convertible debentures due in may be converted earlier  requiring payment of the principal amount thereof in cash 
additional discussion regarding the convertible debentures is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in liquidity and capital resources capital resources  and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments for other long term liabilities are estimates of amounts that will be paid for environmental and retained liabilities of previously owned businesses included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  these estimated payments are based on information currently known to us 
however  it is possible that these estimates will vary from actual results if new information becomes available in the future or if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to these liabilities
