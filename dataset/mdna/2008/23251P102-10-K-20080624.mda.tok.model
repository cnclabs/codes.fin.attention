table of contents overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices that provide a unique therapy  vns therapy  for the treatment of epilepsy  depression and other disorders as approved by the applicable regulatory bodies 
our ability to expand successfully the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable coverage  coding and reimbursement for the implant procedure and follow up care 
currently  we have broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of epilepsy 
absent favorable national and regional coverage policies  we have been obtaining certain case by case approvals for depression since fda approval in july  although case by case coverage is very limited at present 
we believe that long term growth in depression is dependent on identifying and entering into an agreement with a third party for the development of vns therapy for depression and obtaining favorable national and regional coverage policies in depression 
our clinical development program has included pilot and pivotal studies in using vns therapy a as an adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency of seizures in patients over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs and b as an adjunctive treatment of patients years of age and older with chronic or recurrent depression in a major depressive episode 
we have also conducted or provided support for small pilot studies for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  anxiety  chronic migraine headache  bulimia and other disorders 
these studies have been conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of vns therapy for the treatment of these disorders and  in the case of pilot studies  to determine which new indications might be considered for pivotal studies and  therefore  these studies are an important component of our clinical research activities 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with sales and marketing activities in the us and clinical research costs associated with vns therapy 
as of april   we incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate increasing investments in post approval clinical studies 
the primary exchange rate movements that impact our consolidated net sales growth include the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the weakening of the us dollar generally has a favorable impact on our sales for the year 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on our operations due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
proceedings related to stock option grants and practices regulatory proceedings 
in june  the sec staff advised us that it had commenced an informal inquiry of our stock option grants and related practices  procedures and accounting 
in october  the sec staff made an additional request for certain documents and information related to our revised guidance on february  and our financial results announced on may   our sales for the quarter ended april   coverage or potential coverage of our vns therapy system by alabama bluecross blueshield and aetna and the aging of our accounts receivable since january  in addition  we received a subpoena from the us attorney requesting documents related to the same matters 
we are cooperating with both of these governmental investigations 
for additional information  see note litigation governmental investigation of options granting practices in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  we received an irs request for a remote limited scope examination and associated information document requests seeking information related to our stock option practices 
in february  the irs made an additional information document request also related to our stock option practices 
we are endeavoring to cooperate with the irs in this examination by providing documents and information in response to its examination requests 
the examination is ongoing 

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies as the most significant because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and most demanding in terms of requiring estimates and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and general historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or what we have historically experienced would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
our calculation of cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand differs from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals  improvements and expansions are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
leases 
sfas no 
accounting for leases establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for leases by lessees and lessors 
we are a party to the contract of leased facilities and other lease obligations recorded in compliance with sfas no 
the lease terms provide for tenant improvement allowances that are recorded as deferred rent and amortized  using the straight line method  as reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
at april  and april   we had approximately and  in deferred rent  respectively 
scheduled rent increases and paid holidays are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
during fiscal year we surrendered a portion of our leased facilities at cyberonics boulevard in houston texas 
the net present value of our future lease obligations related to the space surrendered as of april   is approximately  partially offset by the net present value of estimated proceeds from the sub lease of the space surrendered of approximately  a net expense and accrued liability of approximately  were recorded as of april  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  providing there are no remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
we record estimated sales returns and discounts as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
our net sales are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to our current policies 
changes in these policies or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 

table of contents licensing revenue 
we evaluate our licensing agreements and recognize licensing revenue considering the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  regulation s x rule b sales and revenue  eitf income statement characterization of reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and other regulations as applicable 
see note licensing agreement for additional information 
licensing expense 
we have executed license agreements under which we have secured the rights provided under certain patents 
royalties payable under the terms of these agreements are expensed as incurred 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we have entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred over the duration of the studies and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly due to possible changes in the timing of clinical activity 
stock options 
prior to april   we adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which disclosures are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because of this election  we accounted for our employee stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and the related interpretations 
we adopted sfas r on april  using the black scholes option pricing model and the modified prospective method  which require the compensation cost to be recognized under sfas r for grants issued after the adoption date and the unvested portion of grants issued prior to the adoption date 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  including the impact associated with the resignation of certain officers and employees during fiscal year we anticipate recognizing approximately million in non cash compensation expense during fiscal year stock based compensation cost is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
restricted stock  restricted stock units and other share based awards 
we may grant restricted stock  restricted stock units or stock awards to directors  officers and certain key employees 
nonvested restricted stock grantees are entitled to dividends  if any  and voting rights for their respective shares 
sale or transfer of the shares is restricted until they are vested 
share grants have no purchase cost to the grantee 
typically  grants vest ratably and compensation costs are amortized over the requisite service period of one to five years 
we also grant restricted stock subject to performance or market conditions that can vest over derived service periods 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined for accounting purposes  on the grant date using the grant date fair market value of our stock 
we utilize the monte carlo simulation method to establish the fair value  the expected vesting date and the derived service period of the market conditions based grants 
the monte carlo simulation method is subject to variability  as several factors utilized must be estimated  including stock price volatility 
foreign exchange 
the primary exchange rate movement that impacts our consolidated net sales growth is the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the weakening of the us dollar generally has a favorable impact on our sales 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on our operations due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a more likely than not criteria in determining if a valuation allowance should be provided 

table of contents results of operations net sales we sell vns therapy systems to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers ascs for both epilepsy and depression indications  but we often do not know the intended use for a specific vns therapy system at the time of its sale 
as a result  we use information available from two separate internal databases to estimate our sales by indication for use 
the fda has designated our vns therapy system  which is a class iii implantable medical device  as a tracked device under the fda s medical device tracking regulation 
consistent with the tracking regulation  we urge each implanting hospital or asc to complete and return to us an implant card that provides information from which we can identify the corresponding indication for use 
we maintain the returned information in an implant card database 
separately  we accumulate information relating to prospective and actual patients  prescribing and implanting physicians  and hospitals and ascs in a sales related database 
we do not receive an implant card for each device we sell  and we sometimes sell devices that are not the subject of data included in our sales related database 
in addition  the delay between the date of a sale and the date of receipt of the corresponding implant card may result in an implant card being received in a fiscal quarter subsequent to the fiscal quarter corresponding to the date of the sale 
we assume that any delay  however  will affect each fiscal quarter by approximately the same extent 
by combining information derived from both the tracking and sales related databases  we form an estimate of the split between units and net sales for the epilepsy and depression indications 
the accuracy of our estimates of sales by indication for use  however  may vary from one fiscal quarter to the next  and investors should exercise caution in relying on these estimates 
us net sales attributable to the depression indication have declined significantly since the cms s may issuance of a national non coverage determination with respect to vns therapy for depression 
using the methodology disclosed above  we estimate that our net domestic sales attributable to depression for fiscal year were approximately million compared to million for the same period last year  a decrease of approximately 
for fiscal year  us sales attributable to depression were million compared to million for the fiscal year  an increase of approximately in fiscal year us net product sales decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal year due to the continued reduction in the number of vns therapy systems attributable to the depression indication  following both the preliminary and final non coverage determinations by cms in february and may  respectively 
international net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due primarily to unit growth and the impact of foreign currency movements 
us net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to higher average selling prices 
international net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due to a increase in new patient sales and a higher average selling price  which in turn was largely due to favorable currency impact and changes in country mix 
the increase in average system price in the us market over the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in the average price for generators of  partially offset by an increase in the number of generators assumed to be sold for the purpose of replacing implanted generators having a battery at or near the end of its useful life 
a replacement generator may be sold without a lead  and therefore the total system price is lower than if a lead was included in the sale 
in the most recent year in the us market  the number of generators sold without leads increased from  to  
table of contents effective december   we entered into the ees license agreement  which grants ees an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications pertaining to weight reduction  hypertension or diabetes 
under the terms of the ees license agreement  ees paid an up front  non refundable payment of million in december in addition  the ees license agreement requires ees to pay a royalty on future commercial sales of any product covered by the licensed patents

while the average selling prices were higher in both the us and international markets  the consolidated average selling price was lower due to the mix between domestic and international sales 
gross profit margin decreased by basis points to compared to fiscal year due to a lower production volumes affecting operational efficiencies  which had an adverse impact of basis points  b stock based compensation expense of million  which had an adverse impact of basis points and c higher average selling prices in generators offset by lower volume of complete systems  which had an unfavorable impact of basis points

debt instruments and related covenants line of credit effective january   we voluntarily terminated the credit agreement in accordance with its terms

convertible notes in september  we issued the convertible notes 
interest on the convertible notes at the rate of per year on the principal amount is payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year  beginning march  the convertible notes are unsecured and subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt and equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior subordinated debt

factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to limited market risk on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not hedge our interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
based upon the average outstanding balances in cash  cash equivalents and our line of credit  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with respect to the us dollar over the euro 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon the net loss recorded during fiscal year would be favorable by approximately million  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on our operations would be unfavorable by approximately million  or 
our convertible notes are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible 
changes in equity prices may result in changes in the fair value of the convertible subordinated debt due to the difference between the current market price of the debt and the market price at the date of issuance of the debt 
at april   a decrease in the price of our common stock could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million on the net fair value of our convertible notes  while a increase in the price of our common stock could have resulted in an increase of approximately million on the fair value of our convertible notes
