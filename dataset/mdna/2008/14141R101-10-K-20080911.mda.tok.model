item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture and market proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery 
in coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg  procedures  veins or arteries are used to construct alternative conduits to restore blood flow beyond closed or narrowed portions of coronary arteries  bypassing the occluded portion of the coronary artery that is impairing blood flow to the heart muscle 
our products provide cardiovascular surgeons with easy to use automated systems to perform consistent  rapid and reliable connections  or anastomoses  of the vessels  which surgeons generally view as the most critical aspect of the bypass procedure 
we currently sell our c port distal anastomosis systems  or c port systems  in the united states and europe 
the c port systems include the c port xa system which was cleared by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in november  the c port flex a system  which was cleared by the fda in april and the c port x change system  which was cleared by the fda in december each of the c port systems is used to perform a distal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to a coronary artery downstream of the occluded portion of the coronary artery 
in addition  we currently sell our pas port proximal anastomosis system  or the pas port system  in europe and japan  and we received k clearance to market our pas port system in the united states in september  the pas port system is used to perform a proximal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to the aorta or other source of blood 
we manufacture c port systems and pas port systems with parts we manufacture and components supplied by vendors  which we then assemble  test and package 
for fiscal year  we generated net revenue of million  including million of development revenue from cook  and incurred a net loss of million 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the next several years as we endeavor to increase adoption of our c port systems and begin to market and sell our pas port system in the united states 
to date  our c port system has had limited commercial adoption 
to help increase adoption of our c port systems in the united states and prepare for the planned us commercial launch of the pas port system  we have increased the size of our sales organization  which has resulted in increased expenses without significant offsetting revenue 
having received k clearance for marketing the pas port system in the united states  we will need to expend additional significant amounts to launch the product in the united states  including increased sales and marketing expenses and increased manufacturing costs 
additionally  we are developing other products both on our own and in collaboration with cook incorporated  or cook  as described below and  unless and until those products are developed and cleared for marketing in the united states and elsewhere  we will have ongoing costs related thereto without related revenue 
our agreements with cook provide us with opportunities for milestone and potentially royalty revenue 
failure to successfully commercially launch our pas port system in the united states and obtain broader adoption of our c port system will further delay potential profitability and negatively impact our financial results and financial position 
in addition  we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may need to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations  including sales and marketing activities and product development 
agreements with cook incorporated in june  we entered into  and in september amended  a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook incorporated  or cook  to develop and commercialize a specialized device  referred to as the 
table of contents pfo device  designed to close holes in the heart from genetic heart defects known as patent foramen ovales  or pfos 
under the agreement  cook funds certain development activities and we and cook jointly develop the device 
once developed  cook receives an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the pfo device 
under this agreement  we have received payments totaling million and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of million in fiscal year and none in fiscal year a total of  under this agreement has been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we are also entitled to receive from cook up to a total of an additional million in future payments if development milestones under the agreement are achieved 
we will receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of the pfo device  if any 
in december we entered into  and in september amended  a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook to develop the cook vascular closure device  formerly called the x port vascular closure device 
under the agreement  cook funds certain development activities  and we and cook jointly develop the device 
cook has received an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the rights to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the cook vascular closure device for medical procedures in any part of the body 
under this agreement  we have received payments totaling million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
a total of  under this agreement has been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we will receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of the cook vascular closure device  if any 
we have also received during fiscal year a payment totaling  from cook for the initial purchase of parts to build a specific number of the cook vascular closure devices for commercial use 
this amount is included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet as of june  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to make significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then the recognition of revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we record product sales net of estimated product returns and discounts from the list prices for our products 
the amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have not been material to date 
we include shipping and handling costs in cost of product sales 
revenue generated from development contracts is recognized upon receipt of milestone payments or upon incurrence of the related development expenses in accordance with contractual terms  based on the actual costs incurred to date plus overhead costs for certain project activities 
amounts paid but not yet earned on the project are refundable and are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the related development expenses are incurred 

table of contents inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market which is determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory write downs are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand or reductions in selling prices 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of product sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory write downs that could adversely impact our financial results 
clinical trial accounting 
clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses and include fees paid to participating hospitals and other service providers that conduct clinical trial activities with patients on our behalf and the cost of clinical trial insurance 
the various costs of the trial are contractually based on the nature of the services  and we accrue the costs as the services are provided 
accrued costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of information received from our third party service providers and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation 
during fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its interpretations 
we adopted sfas no 
r applying the prospective method under which we will continue to account for nonvested equity awards outstanding at the date of adoption of sfas no 
r in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to adoption  that is  we will continue to apply apb no 
in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date we adopted sfas no 
r 
the expected term of options granted under sfas no 
r is determined using the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 as extended by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
since the company is a newly public entity with limited historical data on volatility of its stock  the expected volatility used in fiscal years  and is based on volatility of similar entities referred to as guideline companies 
in evaluating similarity  the company considered factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size  and financial leverage 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a risk free zero coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for option awards using the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period of each grant 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  or per share   or per share and  or per share for fiscal years  and  respectively 
total compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized is approximately million at june  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  certain stock options were granted with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation  net of cancellations due to terminated employees  of million in fiscal year  in accordance with apb no 
 and will amortize this amount on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the 
table of contents options 
we recorded employee stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation of   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded for all option grants through june  is expected to be amortized as follows  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year stock compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these options and warrants granted to non employees  including lenders and consultants  are re measured over the vesting terms as earned  and the resulting value is recognized as an expense over the period the services are received or the term of the related financing

table of contents cmi of million during the period 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year was primarily attributable to cash received of million from our initial public offering completed in february our future capital requirements depend upon numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following market acceptance and adoption of our products  our revenue growth  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals for our products  securing  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs  the progress of clinical trials  and the effects of competing technological and market developments 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with the cash that we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through june  until we can generate significant continuing revenue  if ever  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any licensing or strategic agreements we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or upon terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts or one or more of our research and development programs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate debt securities and debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio as of june  we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions to any material extent 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
as of june   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows in thousands duration less than year to years total principal amount fair value average interest rate additionally  as of june   we had million of notes payable to century 
the notes are due in june and bear interest at per annum
