overview vitran corporation inc vitran or the company is a leading  predominantly non union  provider of freight surface transportation and related logistics services throughout canada and in states in the eastern  central  southwestern and western united states 
its business consists of three operating segments less than truckload services ltl  logistics services  and truckload services 
these services are provided by stand alone business units within their respective regions 
depending on a customer s needs  the units can operate independently or in a complementary manner 
as is more fully described in item business  the ltl segment transports shipments in less than full trailer load quantities through freight service center networks  the logistics segment provides supply chain solutions and freight brokerage services and the truckload segment delivers full trailer loads point to point on a predominantly short haul basis 
vitran s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received for the services provided  and the mix of services supplied to clients 
vitran must manage its fixed and variable operating cost infrastructure in the face of fluctuating volumes to realize appropriate margins while maintaining the quality service expected by its customers 
the long term mission of the company is to build a north american transportation infrastructure with national and regional coverage in both canada and the united states offering regional  inter regional  national  and transborder ltl services 
in conjunction with the ltl services  vitran will also focus on logistics service offerings that are not only profitable as stand alone business opportunities  but also increase the utilization of ltl freight service assets where appropriate 
as a result of an increased number of us shareholders and the continued expansion within the united states  the company  commencing the first quarter of  elected us gaap as its primary reporting standard

executive summary the year ended december  was a challenging year for vitran and the entire freight transportation industry in north america 
the economic slowdown in north america that became apparent to vitran in the third quarter of persisted throughout however  vitran still managed to establish record annual revenue of million and record cash flows from operations before working capital changes of million for the year ended december  these general economic challenges resulted in intensified price competition in vitran s core regional ltl operations and the company s diluted earnings declined to per share 
notwithstanding the economy  the company remained committed to its strategic objectives in the company completed its fourth acquisition in the past three years and its first logistics supply chain purchase  acquiring ontario  california based las vegas la express inc lvla on november  lvla preceded three ltl acquisitions  pjax freight systems pjax on october   sierra west express swe on january  and chris truck line ctl on may  these three ltl acquisitions expanded vitran s ltl coverage from us central states to us states from new jersey to california 
lvla added six leased facilities and  square feet of supply chain logistics space in the states of california  arizona  nevada and new mexico to vitran s existing logistics operations  bringing the total to approximately million square feet under management throughout the us and canada 
the purchase price consideration was million in cash  million of assumed debt  million of potential cash consideration contingent upon lvla reaching specific financial objectives over the next two fiscal years and transaction costs totaling million 
the cash portion of the transaction was financed from vitran s syndicated operating facility 
within vitran s us ltl business unit  significant progress was made on the strategic initiative to migrate all us ltl operations to a new common transportation operating system 
considerable operating management and it resources were consumed to ensure milestones were successfully realized in and to ensure effective system wide migration would be complete in this new transportation operating system will allow for the successful integration of operations across all the acquired entities in the united states and enhance vitran s ability to provide superior service to its customers 
furthermore  the company re invested in its core operating segments in by purchasing all its rolling stock requirements and acquiring real estate in strategic markets 
the ltl segment purchased and expanded service centers in wichita  kansas and cincinnati  ohio respectively and is nearing completion of construction of the new toronto  ontario  canada service center

if not for this write off  interest expense for the year would have been approximately million 
income tax expense for was million compared to million in the effective tax rate was for compared to in the decline in income tax expense is due to a decline in earnings before tax and a decline in the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate can be attributed to a higher proportion of income being earned in lower tax jurisdictions as well as a decline in future tax rates in canada 
on a consolidated basis  the company generated taxable losses in the united states  which have been recognized as future tax assets 
these taxable losses are the result of tax depreciation and amortization on capital assets and goodwill in excess of gaap depreciation and amortization attributable to the company s acquired businesses over the last three years 
management believes the company will generate sufficient taxable income to use these losses in the future

in addition the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the income tax expense differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state and provincial income taxes and earnings in foreign jurisdictions 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates  unfavourable changes in tax laws and regulations  or by adverse tax rulings

intermodal service issues that impacted growth in the canadian national line of business for the previous two years were not factors in and the canadian business unit posted historical growth rates 
the unique transborder service offering between vitran s canadian and us ltl operations grew in compared to lastly  the ltl segment commenced its us inter regional sales initiatives in may of between the central and southwest regions and november between the central and western regions

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 
the company s business is sensitive to general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations  although these factors are mitigated somewhat by the variable nature of many of the company s costs 
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  as well as downturns in the principal regional economies where the company s operations are located  may affect results of operations 
in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are generally lowest in the first and fourth quarters 
vitran is dependent on a major railroad for its national ltl service in canada 
any reduction in service by the railroad is likely to increase costs for the company and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 
the company s exposure to credit risk is not significant as it is not dependent on any particular industry or customer 
the company s single largest customer accounted for of revenue in the general manufacturing industry at approximately of total ltl revenue in represents the most significant industry serviced by the company

the company is subject to numerous laws and regulations by the dot  environmental protection agency epa  internal revenue service  canada customs regulation agency and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
new or more comprehensive laws and regulation including but not limited to fuel emission  driver hours of service  taxation or other mandated regulation could impact profitability 
measures taken by the us and canadian governments to strengthen border security regulations could impact service levels 
vitran s cross border activity represented approximately of the ltl segment revenue in and the company has responded to the new requirements to ensure compliance and safety without jeopardizing the quality of service 
in order to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk in and for future periods  the company entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts with various expiry dates extending to december  at december   of the company s syndicated credit facility was subject to fixed interest rate derivatives 
of vitran s total debt is subject to fixed interest rates 
management continues to evaluate the company s need to fix interest rate exposure or unwind current interest rate swap contracts on an ongoing basis 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the us dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company 
management has designated the company s million of us dollar denominated long term debt in canada as a hedge to the foreign currency exposure generated by the company s us operations 
the company s canadian operations realize foreign exchange gains and losses on the us dollar revenue generated against expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
furthermore  the company reports its results in us dollars thereby exposing the results of the company s canadian operations to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is subject to financial maintenance tests under its term and revolving credit facilities

vitran is also dependent on the availability and price of terminal facilities 
the company is exposed to insurance and claims expenses 
vitran is exposed to claims resulting from cargo loss  auto liability and workers compensation 
an increase in the number and severity of future claims could have an impact on profitability 
the company has indicated that it will integrate the information technology and operations of its acquired companies and future acquisitions within its us ltl business unit 
integration initiatives may not realize the anticipated benefits due to operational issues  disruptions and distractions for employees and management  and potential failures in due diligence 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations before working capital changes for the year increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
non cash working capital changes consumed million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

the majority of capital expenditures in were for replacement rolling stock and real estate related expenditures 
the company purchased a facility in wichita  kansas expanded its cincinnati  ohio facility and is nearing completion of construction of its new ltl service center in toronto  ontario 
the table below sets forth the company s capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands of dollars real estate and buildings tractors trailing fleet information technology leasehold improvements other equipment total management estimates that cash capital expenditures for will be between million and million 
this includes real estate purchase commitments for facilities in las vegas  nevada and kansas city  kansas 
the company may potentially enter into operating leases to fund the acquisition of specific equipment with a capital cost of between million and million 
the company expects to finance its capital requirements with cash flow from operations  new capital or operating leases and if required  its million of unused credit facilities 
the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt consisting of term debt facilities  revolving credit facilities  capital leases for operating equipment and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of tractor  trailing fleet and real estate leases 
operating leases form an integral part of the company s financial structure and operating methodology as they provide an alternative cost effective and flexible form of financing

the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s credit agreement contains certain financial maintenance tests that require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
management does not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving facilities  will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements in as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook as previously mentioned  fiscal was a challenging year  with the continued sluggishness of the north american economy and pricing pressures with the transportation sector impacting the operating results of all segments 
albeit vitran established record revenue and cashflow from operations for the year  net income declined 
the company in reduced its claims ratio in the us ltl operation 
significant milestones were achieved in the us ltl it systems migration with vitran s eastern region successfully going live in the third quarter of the ltl segment achieved a double digit transborder growth rate and both the canadian ltl and us ltl business units increased revenue and yield

critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states together with a reconciliation to canadian gaap  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis  based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
significant estimates are used in determining  but not limited to  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  claims and insurance accruals  share based compensation  intangible asset values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition the company s ltl and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred 
revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the allowance is based on the company s knowledge of the financial condition of its customers  the aging of the receivables  current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance 
the provision for bad debts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in canada  the company has a  deductible and in the united states  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states the company has an  sir per incident for workers compensation and  sir per incident for employee medical 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually  and uses factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method requires certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
the discount rate is based on the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
actual recovery of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired  a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 
the company has not yet completed the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets for the lvla acquisition in property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all property and equipment and continuously evaluates and updates these when circumstances warrant 
actual carrying value of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors or by the company s compensation committee
