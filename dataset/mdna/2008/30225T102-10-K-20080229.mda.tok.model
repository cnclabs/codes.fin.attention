overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  formed to continue the business commenced in by our predecessor companies to own  operate  acquire  develop and redevelop professionally managed self storage properties 
since  our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than self storage properties 
in july  we  along with joint venture partner prudential real estate investors prei  acquired storage usa susa from ge commercial finance for approximately billion in cash 
the transaction made us the second largest operator of self storage facilities in the united states 
at december   we owned or managed properties in states and washington  dc as of december   of our properties were wholly owned  we held joint venture interests in properties  and our taxable reit subsidiary  extra space management  inc  operated an additional properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee 
the properties that we own or in which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately  units and currently serve a customer base of approximately  tenants 
our properties are generally situated in convenient  highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta  baltimore washington  dc  boston  chicago  dallas  houston  las vegas  los angeles  miami  new york city  orlando  philadelphia  phoenix  st 
petersburg tampa and san francisco 
these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels 
the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale 
we consider a property to be in the lease up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy  but before it has achieved stabilization 
a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january  or has been open for three years 
the susa acquisition gave us a national platform upon which to leverage operational  advertising and other economic efficiencies 
the acquisition also created a built in acquisition pipeline through various joint venture  franchise and third party management partners from which we have grown and can continue to grow in the future 
we also retained several key executives from the susa organization  as well as the majority of its field operations team 
to maximize the performance of our properties  we employ a state of the art  proprietary  web based tracking and yield management technology called store 
developed by our management team  store enables us to analyze  set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions 
as part of the susa acquisition  we gained access to susa s industry leading revenue management team revman  which managed susa s rental rate and discount strategies 
we believe that the combination of store s yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by revman has allowed us to more proactively manage revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self storage properties  from management fees on the properties we manage for joint venture partners  franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant insurance program 
our management fee is equal to approximately of total revenues generated by the managed properties 
we operate in competitive markets  often where consumers have multiple self storage properties from which to choose 
competition has impacted  and will continue to impact our property results 
we experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels  with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity 
our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self storage units  to actively manage unit rental rates  and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments 
we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local  regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store  and through the use of the processes developed by revman 
we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value 
our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following maximize the performance of properties through strategic  efficient and proactive management 
we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations 
our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through store s ability to provide real time  interactive rental rate and discount management 
our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national  regional and local marketing programs  which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 
focus on the acquisition of self storage properties from strategic partners and third parties 
our acquisitions team will continue to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi property portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value 
our july acquisition of storage usa has bolstered our reputation as a reliable  ethical buyer  which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close non brokered  private deals 
in addition  our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals 
develop new self storage properties 
we currently have several joint venture and wholly owned development properties and will continue to develop new self storage properties in our core markets 
our development pipeline through includes projects 
the majority of the projects will be developed on a wholly owned basis by the company 
expand our management business 
we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline 
we expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale 
nineteen of our acquisitions came from this channel 
during  we acquired wholly owned properties and a minority equity interest in one additional consolidated property 
we completed the development of six properties in our core markets 
of the properties completed  three are wholly owned  and three are owned by us in joint ventures 
these joint venture properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future 
twelve properties are scheduled for completion in  of which are wholly owned and one of which will be owned by us in a consolidated joint venture 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies consolidation we follow fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
under fin r  arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
under fin r  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or ii the entity s equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur  or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin r  the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
based on the provisions of fin r  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit  or ii enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures  a vie may be created under condition ii b or c of the previous paragraph 
for each vie created  we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin r 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements 
real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development  construction  renovation  and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized 
interest  property taxes  and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements  which are generally between five and years 
in connection with our acquisition of properties  the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values 
the value of the tangible assets  consisting of land and buildings  are determined as if vacant  that is  at replacement cost 
intangible assets  which represent the value of existing tenant relationships  are recorded at their fair values 
we measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities 
we amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a straight line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility currently estimated to be months 
intangible lease rights include purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases  these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and intangibles related to ground leases on four properties that were acquired in these ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases 
the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles  which will be amortized over the lease terms 
evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
if such events occur  we compare the carrying value of these long lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset 
when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value  net of selling costs 
if the estimated fair value  net of selling costs  of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets  then a valuation allowance is established 
the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
investments available for sale we account for our investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires securities classified as available for sale to be stated at fair value 
adjustments to fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
a decline in the market value of investment securities below cost  that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
we classify our investments in auction rate securities as investments available for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the estimation process for fair valuing the investments included consideration of such factors as issuer and insurer credit rating  comparable market data  if available  credit enhancement structures  projected yields  discount rates and terminal periods 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale  receivables  other financial instruments included in other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  variable rate notes payable and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and approximate fair value 
the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december  and was billion and million  respectively 
the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december  and was billion and million  respectively 
investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control  and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary  are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under the equity method  our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions 
equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures 
for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows  we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures 
under this approach  distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg  a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture s sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 
our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
an investment is impaired if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value 
to the extent impairment has occurred  and it is considered to be other than temporary  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income loss  outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock  when converted under the original provisions of the agreement  are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with eitf no 
 implementation issues related to the treatment of minority interest in certain real estate investment trusts 
revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants 
leases are generally on month to month terms 
prepaid rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period 
late charges  administrative fees  merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned 
management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the management agreements 
tenant insurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage 
development fee revenues are recognized as development costs are incurred 
equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities 
interest income is recognized as earned 
property expenses  including utilities  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred 
we accrue for property tax expense based upon estimates and historical trends 
if these estimates are incorrect  the timing of expense recognition could be affected 
real estate sales we evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
in general  sales of real estate and related profits losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition  other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  among other things  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets 
as a reit  we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders 
we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
we are subject to certain state and local taxes 
provision for such taxes has been included in property operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated

revenues from management and franchise fees have remained fairly stable compared to the previous year 
increased revenues at our joint venture  franchise  and third party managed sites related to rental rate and occupancy increases have been offset by lost management fees due to the termination of certain management agreements mainly due to the acquisition of the managed properties 
tenant insurance the increase in tenant insurance revenues is due to the introduction of our captive insurance program at all wholly owned properties in october in addition  during the year ended december   we promoted the tenant insurance program and successfully increased overall customer participation to approximately at december  compared to approximately at december  development fees the increase in development fee revenues was due to the increased volume of development relating to joint ventures in compared to expenses the following table sets forth information on expenses for the years indicated year ended december  change change expenses property operations    tenant insurance    unrecovered development and acquisition costs general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    total expenses    property operations the increase in property operations expense in was primarily due to increases of  associated with acquisitions completed in and there were also increases in expenses of  at existing properties primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance  insurance and property taxes

management and franchise fees our taxable reit subsidiary  extra space management  inc  manages properties owned by our joint venture franchisees and third parties 
management fees generally represent of cash collected from properties owned by third party franchisees and unconsolidated joint ventures 
the increase in management fees is due mainly to fees associated with the susa acquisition which occurred in july through this acquisition we obtained equity interests in joint ventures which owned over properties 
we obtained management contracts for these new joint venture properties  and also obtained over new third party and franchise management contracts in conjunction with the susa acquisition

we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings loss because net earnings loss assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
we believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis 
we believe that to further understand our performance  ffo should be considered along with the reported net income loss and cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance  as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions

the decrease consisted primarily of additional borrowings in of  versus  in  and net proceeds from share issuances of  in versus  in this was offset by repayments on borrowings of  in  compared to  in in addition  the company also paid  in dividends to common stockholders in  compared to  in operational summary our operating results were positive and reflected solid operating fundamentals and operational efficiency with increases in both revenues and net operating income 
on a same store basis  revenue increased and noi increased 
same store expense increases were minimal  with a year on year increase of a modest 
revenue increases were driven mostly by rate growth to existing tenants  as year end same store occupancy decreased to as compared to the previous year 
the markets of chicago  columbus  dallas and houston were top performers in year on year revenue growth at stabilized properties 
the markets of san francisco oakland and detroit also realized solid year on year increases in revenues 
markets performing below the portfolio average in year on year revenue growth included atlanta  las vegas  sacramento and phoenix 
properties in markets throughout florida continue to perform below the portfolio average  though the occupancy began to stabilize during the three months ended december  outlook though the level of growth experienced in was less than in  we continue to see strength in self storage fundamentals in many of our core markets 
we believe that the ability to increase revenues in over levels achieved in exists  as field surveys show low levels of new supply and our internal customer research indicates continued demand for the self storage product type 
we anticipate continued competition from all operators  both public and private  in all of the markets in which we operate 
however  we believe that the quality and location of our property portfolio  our scale as the second largest operator of self storage  our revenue management systems  and experienced team give us the ability to perform well in various competitive and economic environments 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million available in cash and cash equivalents 
we intend to use this cash to purchase additional self storage properties  to fund development and to fund operations in the first two quarters of we are required to distribute at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit 
therefore  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
at december   we had million par value invested in ars which are classified as available for sale investments 
auction rate securities are generally long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par 
our investments are in non mortgage backed ars  are insured against loss of principal and interest and have credit ratings of aaa aa 
as a result of unsuccessful auctions  the interest rate is paid at libor plus or basis points and the liquidity of these investments has been diminished 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash including our credit line  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business 
related to these failed auctions  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge and a million temporary impairment charge to reduce the value of our investment in ars to an estimated fair value of million 
on october   we entered into a new million revolving line of credit the credit line that matures october  we intend to use the proceeds of the credit line for general corporate purposes 
the credit line has an interest rate of between and basis points over libor  depending on certain of our financial ratios 
the credit line is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets 
as of december   the credit line had million of capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit line 
no amounts were outstanding on the credit line at december  on october   we entered into a reverse interest rate swap the swap agreement with us bank national association  relating to our existing million fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank  which is due in pursuant to the swap agreement  we will receive fixed interest payments of and pay variable interest payments based on the one month libor plus on a notional amount of million 
there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 
as of december   we had approximately billion of debt  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 
as of december   the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 
the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december  was we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements  including operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures  dividends to stockholders  distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit line 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders  new facility development  property acquisitions  principal payments under our borrowings and non recurring capital expenditures 
we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings  joint ventures with third parties  and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt 
we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from self storage owners who desire tax deferral in their exiting transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations dollars in thousands the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december  total less than year years years after years operating leases      notes payable  exchangeable senior notes and notes payable to trusts interest      principal      total contractual obligations    as of december   the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was  and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 
financing strategy we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors 
although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur  we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time  as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate 
in making financing decisions  we will consider factors including but not limited to the interest rate of the proposed financing  the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties  prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing  the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing  long term objectives with respect to the financing  target investment returns  the ability of particular properties  and our company as a whole  to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments  overall level of consolidated indebtedness  timing of debt and lease maturities  provisions that require recourse and cross collateralization  corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage  debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets  and the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt 
our indebtedness may be recourse  non recourse or cross collateralized 
if the indebtedness is non recourse  the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates 
in addition  we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties  or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 
we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness  to refinance investments  including the redevelopment of existing properties  for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 
seasonality the self storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september 
historically  our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july  while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 
results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
recent accounting pronouncements emerging issues task force eitf topic d  determining the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share under fasb statement no 
topic d  discussed at the march  eitf meeting  was effective at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after june  topic d provides the sec staff s view as to how one must evaluate whether a preferred stock host contract is a debt host or an equity host 
it states that the determination of the nature of the host contract for a hybrid financial instrument that is  whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity issued in the form of a share should be based on a consideration of economic characteristics and risks 
the sec staff believes that the consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract should be based on all the stated and implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument 
this may represent a change from the way these instruments were analyzed in the past 
we elected to early adopt topic d which specifically relates to the issuance of preferred op units in connection with the aaaaa rent a space acquisition that was completed during the quarter ended june  in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  and does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
the fsp 
the fsp amends fas to delay the effective date for fas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
for items within its scope  the fsp defers the effective date of fas to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not quantified the impact that the adoption of fas will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
under fas  a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not quantified the impact that the adoption of fas will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revised statement no 
 business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
generally  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction will be recorded at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
fas r will also change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination 
fas r applies proactively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after december  we will assess the impact of fas r if and when a future acquisition occurs 
however  the application of fas r will result in a significant change in accounting for future acquisitions after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not currently expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our future income  cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we had approximately billion in total debt of which million was subject to variable interest rates including the million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap 
if libor were to increase or decrease by basis points  the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december  was billion 
the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at december  was billion
