item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of digital power control systems that are used to control motion and power primarily in material handling  elevator and energy delivery applications 
our systems consist primarily of programmable motion control and power conditioning systems used in the following applications overhead cranes and hoists  elevators  coal mining equipment  and alternative energy applications  including wind turbines and photovoltaic power systems 
we believe that with our technical and productive resources we are well positioned to respond to increasing demand in our served markets 
our operations are located in north america  predominantly in menomonee falls  wisconsin  our company headquarters 
product offerings for material handling applications include drive systems  radio remote controls  and braking  collision avoidance  and electrification subsystems  sold primarily to oems of overhead cranes and hoists 
we have a significant market share in north america in ac control systems and believe we have growth opportunities in dc control systems for retrofit applications  wireless remote controls and in automating existing manual material handling processes 
our product offerings for elevator applications are comprised of highly integrated subsystems and drives used to control motion primarily in high rise  high speed elevator applications 
our products are sold mainly to elevator oems and we have a significant share of the available market for dc drives and subsystems used in high rise elevators for both new and retrofit projects 
we believe we have opportunities for growth in available elevator markets by introducing new energy saving product offerings for dc applications  expanding the breadth of our product offering to include competitive low end products for lower performance ac applications  and using our new product offerings to expand geographically 
our product offerings for energy delivery applications include power inverters for alternative energy applications  including wind turbines and photovoltaic installations  which deliver ac power to the utility grid from generators inside wind turbines or from solar panels  or deliver power for consumption at the source 
both the wind and solar markets are growing very rapidly in north america as wind and solar power are becoming increasingly competitive from a cost standpoint with more traditional methods of power generation 
we believe our product offerings have us well positioned to take advantage of growth in alternative energy markets and expect sales of power inverters for alternative energy applications to be our fastest revenue growth product over the next several years 
continuing operations we focus on a variety of key indicators to monitor our business performance 
these indicators include order rates  sales growth  gross profit margin  operating profit margin  net income  earnings per share  and working capital and cash flow measures 
these indicators are compared to our operating plans as well as to our prior year actual results  and are used to measure our success relative to our company objectives 
our company objectives are to grow sales at least on a year over year basis  to achieve gross margins and operating profit margins  and to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations and meet our obligations 
during fiscal  we achieved year over year sales growth from fiscal mainly due to successful introduction of new products in our served markets 
sales growth of material handling product offerings was mainly due to higher sales of digital dc drives for retrofit applications and higher sales of automation projects  while our base ac business also increased as industrial activity in the us remained strong throughout most of fiscal we also began initial production and shipments of wind inverters during fiscal fiscal gross margin was while operating profit margin was in our first full year of operation since completion of our fiscal restructuring initiatives 
during fiscal we completed the divestiture of our power electronics business  repaid all of our outstanding debt  and made a million contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
we also restructured our management team  reduced our corporate overhead by over million annually and relocated our corporate headquarters to menomonee falls  wisconsin 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we classified the assets and liabilities of our tps business as held for sale  and the results of operations of the business as discontinued operations 
our telecom product offerings have been focused on providing back up power for wireless applications 
during fiscal  we relocated the telecom power manufacturing operations from dallas  texas to menomonee falls  wisconsin 
while we were successful at increasing operating efficiencies and reducing overhead costs in the tps business  we were not able to increase telecom power sales by expanding our customer base and we continued to generate operating losses in the tps business throughout fiscal in april  we announced our decision to divest our tps business after concluding that our best growth prospects lay in our core power control and systems businesses 
we believe we can better achieve our sales growth objectives by redirecting resources currently deployed in the tps business to our product offerings in the material handling  elevator and energy delivery markets 
we are currently in negotiations with a prospective buyer and expect to complete the transaction during the first quarter of fiscal we believe that future increased profitability is dependent upon increased sales revenue and improvement in gross margins 
our fiscal sales growth has been  and we believe our fiscal sales growth will continue to be  dependent on continuing strong demand for material handling products and successful introduction and increasing acceptance of new products  mainly in the elevator and alternative energy markets 
recent new product offerings are gaining acceptance with customers in the marketplace  however  the rate of growth is slower than we previously expected 
while we believe we can achieve double digit year over year sales growth with existing product offerings and new product introductions  we may pursue selective external growth opportunities to enhance or expand our product offerings  market channels or technical resources 
in addition  our material handling business is influenced by cyclical forces in the industrial marketplace 
a cyclical slowdown could negatively impact our sales growth rate 
sales of material handling product offerings comprised nearly of our sales in fiscal gross margins in our continuing operations have historically been near or above and we are targeting this level of gross margin going forward 
improvement in gross margins is mainly dependent upon a continuing economic expansion  continued acceptance of recently introduced product offerings by the marketplace  and successful cost reduction actions related to recent new elevator and alternative energy product offerings 
we intend to focus our development and marketing efforts on internal sales growth opportunities across all product lines  with an emphasis on energy efficient power products 
while we also intend to control our operating expenses  we expect these expenses to increase in fiscal due to increased sales and marketing expense aimed at enhancing our sales infrastructure across all product lines  higher volume related selling expenses and higher non cash pension expense  which is expected to increase by approximately million over fiscal levels 
the expected higher pension expense in fiscal is mainly due to negative returns on plan assets experienced during fiscal we expect that fiscal operating margin as a percent of sales will likely be comparable to or down slightly from fiscal operating margins of  due mainly to the expected higher pension expense 
through utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes  we believe the majority of our reported operating profit can be realized as net income 
discontinued operations as discussed above  the operating results of our tps business as well as certain expenses related to previously divested businesses  including the historical operating results of the power electronics business divested in fiscal  have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to previously divested businesses have historically included charges for an arbitration award in a patent infringement claim and related legal fees  as well as certain expenses for environmental issues  asbestos claims and product liability claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all of these issues relate to businesses we no longer own and most relate to indemnification agreements we provided when we divested those businesses 
going forward  our discontinued operations will include the results of our telecom power systems business until it is divested  as well as additional costs we may incur related to businesses no longer owned  and may include additional costs above those currently estimated and accrued related to the divestiture of our power electronics business 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and judgments by management that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
such estimates are based upon historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable given known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and update our estimates  and we believe the following discussion addresses our policies which are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations and which require our most complex judgments 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to losses from uncollectible receivables in excess of our allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from customers inability to make required payments 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
our total allowance includes a specific allowance based on identification of customers where we feel full payment is in doubt  as well as a general allowance calculated based on our historical losses on accounts receivable as a percentage of historical sales 
we believe that our methodology has been effective in accurately quantifying our allowance for doubtful accounts and do not anticipate changing our methodology in the future 
however  if the financial conditions of any of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we believe that all appropriate allowances have been provided 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
we identify potentially obsolete and excess inventory by evaluating overall inventory levels in relation to expected future requirements and market conditions  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and inventory valuation are recorded accordingly 
items with no usage for the past months and no expected future usage are considered obsolete  and are disposed of or fully reserved 
reserves for excess inventory are determined based upon historical and anticipated usage as compared to quantities on hand 
excess inventory is defined as inventory items with on hand quantities in excess of one year s usage and specified percentages are applied to the excess inventory value in determining the reserve 
our assumptions have not changed significantly in the past  and are not likely to change in the future 
we believe that our assumptions regarding inventory valuation have been accurate in the past 
long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment 
impairment charges are recorded in operating results when the undiscounted future expected cash flows derived from an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill  and may be required to test more frequently in certain circumstances 
we have elected to perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in assessing potential impairment  we make estimates regarding the fair value of the related long lived assets 
no impairments were recognized in long lived assets or goodwill for the years ended june   and july  for the fiscal year ended july   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our discontinued power electronics business  included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal pension benefits we sponsor a defined benefit plan frozen in that covers primarily former employees in the us the valuation of our pension plan requires the use of assumptions and estimates that attempt to anticipate future events to develop actuarial valuations of expenses  assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and mortality rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
our plan assets are comprised mainly of common stock and bond funds 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and is generally not changed on an annual basis 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was in fiscal  and the discount rate reflects the market for high quality fixed income debt instruments and is subject to change each year 
as of june   the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation was as compared to at july  changes in assumptions typically result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized over future accounting periods in accordance with the methods specified in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended 
if our actual return on plan assets is below our expected return on plan assets  this typically results in increased future pension expense 
as a result of lower than expected returns on plan assets in fiscal  our fiscal pension expense is expected to increase by million from fiscal  due to amortization of actuarial losses and a decrease in our expected return on plan assets 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual future investment returns or discount rates could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations and related funding requirements 
reserves for contingencies we periodically record the estimated impact of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
the accounting for such events is prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
sfas no 
does not permit the accrual of gain contingencies under any circumstances 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of uncertain events  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment and we use our internal expertise and outside experts  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and to assist in determining the amount or range of the loss 
in those circumstances where we determined that it was probable that a loss had been incurred  our estimates of the amount of loss have been reasonably accurate 
income taxes we operate in several taxing jurisdictions and are subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities 
we believe we have reasonably estimated our tax positions for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
however  it is possible that  upon closure of our tax periods  our final tax liabilities could differ from our estimates 
we record deferred income tax assets in tax jurisdictions where we generate losses for income tax purposes 
we also record valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  when in our judgment  the deferred income tax assets will likely not be realized in the foreseeable future 
since fiscal we have provided valuation reserves against our us deferred tax assets that result in a net deferred tax liability position 
a portion of our deferred tax liability relates to tax deductible amortization of goodwill that is no longer amortized for financial reporting purposes 
under applicable accounting rules  such deferred tax liabilities are considered to have an indefinite life and are therefore ineligible to be considered as a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
results of operations for year ended june   compared with year ended july  net sales and gross profit net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal is due primarily to increased sales of material handling systems of million  and shipments of wind inverters of million 
net sales by market were as follows  in millions june  july  fiscal year ended sales of sales sales of sales material handling elevator motion control energy systems total net sales gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the million increase in gross profit in fiscal is due to higher sales volume of material handling products  partially offset by start up costs and shipment of relatively lower margin wind inverters and lower sales volume of mining products in fiscal the start up costs and wind inverter shipments were also the main reason for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses research and development r d expense was million in fiscal  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal fiscal r d expense includes million in restructuring costs related to elimination of our corporate r d function

net loss we recorded a net loss in fiscal of million  or a loss per share on both a basic and diluted basis  compared to a fiscal net loss of million  or a loss per share on both a basic and diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalent balance  including restricted cash  decreased million during the year ended june   from million at july   to million at june  restricted cash decreased by million during fiscal  due mainly to a payment of million in settlement of a patent infringement arbitration proceeding the settlement payment brought against us by ole k 
nilssen see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unrestricted cash balances increased during the year from million at july   to million at june  the primary sources of cash during fiscal were income from operating activities of million  proceeds from a settlement trust of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  deposits received from escrow net of the settlement payment of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
the primary uses of cash in fiscal were for the settlement payment  a million contribution to our defined benefit pension plan  and million for the purchase of the assets of enrange llc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  comparable to depreciation expense of million 
while we may make further investments to increase capacity and improve efficiency  we do not anticipate that capital expenditures in fiscal will exceed million 
the expected amount of capital expenditures could change depending upon changes in revenue levels  our financial condition and the general economy 
on november   based upon mutual agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc wff  our amended revolving credit agreement with wff was terminated without penalty prior to its expiration in december  and we entered into an agreement with associated bank  na providing for a million revolving credit facility the associated facility 
borrowings under the associated facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus  with borrowing levels determined by a borrowing base formula as defined in the agreement  based on the level of eligible accounts receivable 
the associated facility also supports the issuance of letters of credit  places certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions  and includes covenants which require minimum operating profit levels and limit annual capital expenditures 
borrowings under the associated facility are secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
the associated facility expires in november unless renewed by the parties prior to that time 
there were no amounts outstanding under the associated facility and the company is in compliance with all covenants as of june  primarily as a result of the decline in interest rates over the past several years and a more recent decline in values in equity markets  the accumulated benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plan currently exceeds plan assets 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the divestiture of our power electronics business to contribute million to our pension plan in december we also made a contribution of million in april funded by existing cash on hand 
under funding regulations  actuarial projections as of december indicate that we will be required to make quarterly contributions to the plan aggregating approximately million within the next months  beginning in july required contributions beyond the next months could still be significant  and will depend on future interest rate levels  values in equity and fixed income markets  and the level and timing of additional interim contributions we may make to the plan 
we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities as of june  based upon current plans and business conditions  we believe that current cash balances  borrowing capacity under our associated facility and internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated operational needs  capital expenditures and other commitments over the next months 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments future payments due under contractual obligations of our continuing operations as of june   follow in thousands less than year to years to years more than years total pension funding operating leases purchase obligations enrange acquisition capital lease obligations total pension funding amounts in the table above are based on current regulations and actuarial calculations at june  actual funding amounts could vary  depending on future interest rate levels and values in equity and fixed income markets 
the amounts in the table above do not include our aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable subleases of million as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks has changed significantly as a result of the divestiture of our power electronics business in october our exposure to interest rate risk decreased significantly  as we have no debt outstanding as of june   and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates decreased significantly  as the divestiture included the majority of our international operations 
we did not have any outstanding hedge instruments or contracts at june  and july  interest rates the fair value of our debt was effectively zero at june  our reported debt balance was comprised entirely of capital lease obligations 
as a result  at june   a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have a negligible impact on our annual interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates  but we may selectively enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures 
gains and losses on these non us currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure 
we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding at june   and july
