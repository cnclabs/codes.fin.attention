power costs in its general rate order  the opuc also approved a process by which pge can continue to adjust prices to reflect power cost forecasts for future years 
an annual power cost update tariff  which replaced the former resource valuation mechanism  provides for rate adjustments to reflect updated forecasts of net variable power costs nvpc for future calendar years 
in addition  a new power cost adjustment mechanism pcam was approved by the opuc  effective january  under the pcam  pge can adjust future prices to reflect a portion of the difference between each year s forecasted nvpc included in prices the baseline  and actual nvpc 
under the pcam  pge is subject to a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the difference between actual nvpc and that included in base prices by application of an asymmetrical deadband within which pge absorbs cost increases or decreases  with a sharing of costs and benefits between customers and the company outside of the deadband 
a refund will occur only to the extent that it results in pge s actual return on equity roe for that year being no less than basis points above the company s last authorized roe 
a collection will occur only to the extent that it results in pge s actual roe for that year being no greater than basis points below the company s last authorized roe 

table of contents for  the deadband ranged from million below  to million above  the baseline 
pge s actual nvpc as determined under the pcam for were less than the established baseline by million 
accordingly  an estimated refund to customers of million was recorded as a regulatory liability and is reflected as an increase to purchased power and fuel expenses 
any regulatory asset or liability arising from application of the pcam is subject to the results of a regulated earnings test  with final determination of any customer refund or collection made by the opuc through a public filing and review 
for  the deadband will range from million below  to million above  baseline nvpc 
retail customer choice program implemented in as part of oregon s electricity restructuring law  oregon s customer choice program  along with related regulations and pge s tariff  allows the company s commercial and industrial customers direct access to other suppliers of electricity electricity service suppliers  or esss 
while direct access customers purchase their electricity from other suppliers  pge continues to deliver the energy to these customers 
the program provides for a transition adjustment for customers that choose to purchase energy at market prices from investor owned utilities or from esss 
such transition adjustments reflect the above market or below market cost  respectively  of energy resources owned or purchased by the utility and are designed to ensure that such costs or benefits do not unfairly shift to the utility s remaining energy customers 
the retail customer choice program has no material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
in  the three esss registered to transact business with pge served a total of customers with a total average load of approximately mwa  representing approximately of pge s non residential load and of the company s total retail load 
cost of service and market price options are also available to pge s commercial and industrial customers 
the company offers an option by which certain large non residential customers may  for a minimum three or five year term  elect to be removed from cost of service pricing  with energy supplied by an ess or at a daily market rate by pge 
a total of commercial and industrial customers were receiving service from pge under market based pricing options at the end of residential and small commercial customers can purchase electricity from pge from a portfolio of rate options that include a basic cost of service rate  a time of use rate  and renewable resource rates 
approximately  customers have chosen renewable energy options and approximately  customers have chosen the time of use option 
public purpose charge the restructuring law also provides for a public purpose charge to fund cost effective conservation measures  new renewable energy resources  and weatherization measures for low income housing

the following table summarizes pge s revenues for the years indicated dollars in millions years ended december  amount amount amount revenues retail wholesale other operating revenues total revenues retail pge serves a diverse retail customer base 
residential customers comprise approximately of the company s total customers  with the remainder comprised of commercial and industrial customers 
total retail revenues for were fairly evenly divided between residential and commercial and industrial customer classes 
residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather  with demand highest during the winter heating season 
commercial and industrial customer classes are not dominated by any single industry 
while the largest customers constitute about of total retail revenues  they represent nine different commercial and industrial groups  including high technology  paper manufacturing  metal fabrication  health services  and governmental agencies 
no single customer represents more than of pge s total retail load or of total retail revenues 
wholesale pge participates in the wholesale marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts 
the company s wholesale market participation includes power purchases and sales resulting from economic dispatch decisions for its own generation  which allows pge to secure reasonably priced power for its customers  and purchases and sales of natural gas 
interconnected transmission systems in the western states serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power  water conditions  and seasonal demand 
most of pge s wholesale sales are to utilities and power marketers and are predominantly short term 
the company may net purchases and sales with the same counterparty termed book outs rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power  with only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations physically settled 
other operating revenues other operating revenues include sales of natural gas in excess of generating plant requirements and revenues from transmission services  pole contact rentals  and certain other electric services to customers

table of contents power and fuel supply power supply pge relies upon its existing base of generating resources  as well as short and long term power contracts  to meet its customers energy needs 
at december   pge s total firm resource capacity  including short term purchase agreements  was approximately  mw net of short term sales agreements of mw 
the pacific northwest peak usage season historically occurs in the winter  when residential and commercial heating and lighting demand is highest 
pge s all time high net system load peak  mw occurred in december the company s all time summer peak  mw  driven by unusually warm weather and increased air conditioning demand  occurred in july generation pge s current generating portfolio consists of thermal primarily coal and natural gas  hydro  and wind resources that together provide  mw of total net capability 
see item properties for a full listing of pge s generating facilities 
thermal the company s thermal generation facilities continued to supply reliable power during in june  port westward  a new mw natural gas fired generating plant  was placed in service at a total cost of million  including allowance for funds used during construction afdc 
hydro the company s lowest cost generating resources are its ferc licensed hydroelectric projects 
northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region s power supply  with water conditions significantly impacting pge s cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases 
current forecasts indicate near normal hydro conditions for wind biglow canyon wind farm biglow canyon  located in sherman county  oregon  is pge s newest and largest renewable energy project 
phase i of biglow canyon  comprised of wind turbines with a total capacity of mw  was completed and placed in service in mid december at a total cost of approximately million including afdc 
phases ii and iii of the project are in the advanced planning stages  with an estimated total cost of million to million  including approximately million of afdc 
phase ii is expected to be completed by the end of and phase iii is expected to be completed by the end of when completed  the three phase project is expected to have a total installed capacity of to mw 
purchased power pge supplements its own generation with short and long term wholesale contracts as needed to meet its retail load requirements and provide the most economic mix on a variable cost basis 
pge also has firm contracts  ranging from one to thirty years  to purchase up to mwa of power from counterparties  including pacific northwest utilities and the confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation of oregon 
the year agreement is for mwa of wind capacity with an independent power producer 
in addition  pge has an exchange contract with a summer peaking california utility to help meet the company s winter peaking requirements  and an exchange contract with another northwest utility to help meet the company s summer peaking requirements 
these resources  along

mid columbia hydro matters the company has long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington related to four hydroelectric projects on the mid columbia river 
the contracts provide approximately mw of firm capacity  and expire between and in  pge executed new agreements with grant county public utility district grant  operator of the priest rapids and wanapum projects  for periods corresponding to grant s new license term  to be determined by the ferc 
the priest rapids agreement became effective in november and the wanapum agreement will become effective november  both contracts  approved by the ferc  extend through the life of grant s new license  which is expected to be approximately years 
under the terms of the agreements  grant will annually determine the output required for its purposes  while pge will be required to purchase approximately of the output in excess of grant s requirements over the term of the new license  for which pge will pay a proportional share of the project s debt service and operating costs 
pge s share in the projects is expected to steadily decline as grant s needs increase  with the company s share in the two projects reduced from the current mw to an estimated mw in also under the agreements  pge is to purchase an additional mwa annually during the period for further information regarding pge s power purchase contracts from mid columbia projects  see note  commitments and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fuel supply pge contracts for natural gas and coal supplies used to fuel the company s thermal generating plants 
pge also uses forward  swap  option  and futures contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
the company acquires coal and natural gas as follows coal boardman pge has a purchase agreement that provides coal for boardman s operating requirements through the coal  obtained from surface mining operations in wyoming  is delivered by rail under two separate ten year transportation contracts  the terms of which began january  coal purchases in  totaling million tons  contained approximately of sulfur by weight 
utilizing low sulfur coal  the plant emitted less than the limit allowed by the epa of pounds of sulfur dioxide so per mmbtu 
colstrip coal for colstrip units and  located in southeastern montana  is obtained from an adjacent mine under a contract that expires in the contract requires that the coal not exceed a maximum sulfur content of by weight 
in  actual sulfur content for coal used at colstrip ranged from approximately to by weight 
available coal supplies are sufficient to meet future requirements of the plant 
coal purchases for pge s share of colstrip units and totaled million tons in utilizing wet scrubbers to minimize so emissions  the plant operated in compliance with epa s source performance standards 
natural gas beaver and port westward pge owns of the kelso beaver pipeline  which directly connects both its beaver and port westward generating plants to northwest pipeline  an interstate gas pipeline operating between british columbia and new mexico 
pge has received authorization from the ferc to transport natural gas for others under a part blanket transportation certificate 

table of contents currently  pge transports gas on the kelso beaver pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement  with capacity offered on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the company 
firm gas supplies for beaver and port westward may be purchased up to months in advance  based on anticipated operation of the plants 
pge has access to  dth day of firm gas transportation capacity to serve the two plants 
in addition  pge has contractual access  through april  to natural gas storage in mist  oregon  from which it can draw in the event that gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available to fully meet anticipated requirements of beaver and port westward for coyote springs the coyote springs generating station utilizes  dth day of firm transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in alberta  canada 
firm gas supplies for coyote springs  based on anticipated operation of the plant  may be purchased up to months in advance 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available to fully meet requirements of coyote springs for oil beaver the beaver generating station has the capability to operate at full capacity on no 
diesel fuel oil when it is economic or if the plant s natural gas supply is interrupted 
pge had an approximate day supply of oil at the plant site at december  coyote springs the coyote springs plant has the capability to operate on oil  although such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations 
reliability wholesale power market products  along with pge s base of thermal  hydroelectric and wind generating capacity  currently provide the company with the flexibility to respond to seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity from its retail and wholesale customers 
although surplus generation has diminished in recent years due to economic and population growth in the western united states  the recent construction of new generating plants has increased the region s capacity to meet its power needs 
pge anticipates that generating capacity within the wecc  as well as an active wholesale market  will continue to provide sufficient energy to supplement the company s generation and purchases under current short and long term power contracts 
to meet anticipated future requirements and help assure continued system reliability  pge s integrated resource planning process utilizes input from several sources  including long term forecasts prepared by both pge and the wecc 
integrated resource plan pge s integrated resource plan irp  required by the opuc  describes the company s energy supply strategy 
the primary goal of the irp is to identify a resource action plan that  when considered with the company s existing portfolio  provides the best combination of expected cost and associated risks and uncertainties for pge and its customers 
pge filed an irp with the opuc in june that covers the years through it includes additional renewable and demand side resources  energy efficiency programs  power purchase agreements of varying terms  and the acquisition of additional peaking capacity 
the plan was developed over an month period that included significant research and discussion with customer groups  independent consultants  and regulators 

table of contents the irp action plan proposes the following continued development of biglow canyon  with wind turbines to provide a total maximum generating capacity of to mw 
phase i is complete with phase ii expected to be completed by the end of  and phase iii by the end of procurement of an additional mwa of renewable power 
combined with biglow canyon and existing renewable resources  this will help pge meet oregon s new renewable energy standard 
expansion of energy efficiency programs in partnership with the eto 
the goal is to increase the amount of load met through efficiency measures by an additional mw beyond the amount already targeted by the eto by purchase power agreements with durations of five to ten years  intended to reduce reliance on spot market purchases  help stabilize customer prices  and meet electricity demand while giving new technologies time to mature and become cost effective 
acquisition of mw of peaking capacity  through ownership or contract  to meet an increase in forecasted winter and summer peak requirements and to facilitate the integration of variable wind generation 
seasonal capacity purchases of mw 
review of the irp by stakeholders and the opuc staff is continuing and will be completed when the opuc determines the action plan appears reasonable and issues an acknowledgement order  which is expected in march the company expects to issue a request for proposal for energy related resources shortly after acknowledgement of the irp 

table of contents environmental matters pge operates in a state recognized for environmental leadership 
the company s policy of environmental stewardship seeks to minimize environmental risk and waste in its operations and promote the efficient use of energy 
pge s operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  including those related to air and water quality  noise  and waste disposal 
the epa and certain state agencies  including the oregon environmental quality commission oeqc  the oregon department of environmental quality deq  the oregon department of energy  and the efsc  have direct jurisdiction over environmental matters that include the siting and operation of generating facilities and the accumulation  cleanup  and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
climate change greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impacts on climate change and global warming have recently received increased public attention  with several legislative efforts initiated to establish mandatory control of emissions from thermal electricity generating plants 
pge is participating as a stakeholder in the western climate initiative  a regional accord with a stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to below levels by the year any future laws that impose mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions could have a material impact on electric utilities that rely on coal as a fuel resource 
pge s ownership shares of the boardman and colstrip coal plants comprise approximately one fourth of the company s net generation capability 
renewable energy standards renewable energy standards adopted by the oregon legislature require that pge and other large electricity providers serve at least of their retail load within the state from renewable resources by the year  increasing to by additional interim steps in the standard include meeting of retail load by and by biglow canyon  which is expected to have a total installed capacity of to mw when all three phases are completed by the end of  represents a significant step toward the company s achievement of these goals 
air quality standards pge s operations  principally its fossil fuel generation plants  are subject to the federal clean air act caa 
primary pollutants addressed by the caa that affect pge are so  nitrogen oxides  carbon monoxide  and particulate matter 
state governments also monitor and administer certain portions of the caa and must set standards that are at least equal to federal standards 
oregon s air quality standards currently exceed federal standards 
pge manages its emissions by the use of low sulfur fuel  emission controls  emission monitoring  and combustion controls 
the so emissions allowances awarded under the caa  along with expected future annual allowances  are sufficient to operate boardman at to of capacity 
pge has acquired additional emissions allowances  which  in combination with the allowance awards  are expected to allow pge to meet the so emission requirements for the boardman plant at forecasted capacity for at least the next ten years 
the federal government and the states in which pge operates have adopted the following regulations concerning mercury emissions in may  the epa adopted the clean air mercury rule that establishes a cumulative total cap of mercury emissions from all electric generating plants in the united states and assigns to each state a mercury emissions budget 

table of contents in october  the montana board of environmental review adopted final rules on mercury emissions from coal fired generating plants in montana  including colstrip  which set strict mercury emission limits by in december  the oregon environmental quality commission adopted the utility mercury rule  which requires installation of mercury control technology at boardman and requires that the plant reduce its mercury emissions by by july  in february  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit published a unanimous decision vacating both the epa s rule delisting coal and oil fired electric generating units from regulation under of the caa and the clean air mercury rule 
the oregon utility mercury rule was not directly affected by this decision  however  it contains significant components of the federal clean air mercury rule and thus it is reasonably likely that amendments will be required if the district of columbia circuit decision is not overturned 
in accordance with new federal regional haze rules aimed at visibility impairment in several federally protected areas  the deq is conducting an assessment of emission sources pursuant to a regional haze best available retrofit technology bart process 
several other states are conducting a similar process 
those sources determined to cause  or contribute to  visibility impairment at protected areas will be subject to a bart determination 
in response to the epa s regional haze rules  the company volunteered to participate in a deq pilot project to analyze information about air emissions from boardman 
an exemption modeling analysis for identified sources  which began in september  has indicated that the boardman and beaver generating plants may cause or contribute to visibility impairment in several federally protected areas 
in november  the company submitted a bart determination to the deq for boardman that stated that the bart for boardman is a combination of new low no 
x 
burners  modified over fire air system  selective non catalytic reduction sncr  and semi dry flue gas desulphurization  and that mercury emission regulations should be addressed through a mercury sorbent injection system 
the cost for these controls is estimated to be in the range of million to million of total costs 
while the company believes that these controls meet bart requirements  it is possible that the regulatory agencies could require selective catalytic reduction rather than sncr  which would increase the estimated cost to a range of million to million of total costs 
the company has no commitments in place at this time and cautions that the cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change 
final approval of the plan is expected to occur in the second half of as the regulatory requirements are clarified by the relevant agencies and the related costs more closely estimated  pge will further evaluate the economic prudency of these expenditures 
in doing so  the company will also consider additional costs  including taxes  emission fees and other costs that may be imposed under any future laws related to climate change 
such additional costs  as well as the requirement to install selective catalytic reduction controls  could require an investment in excess of what the plant can economically support 
the ultimate impact that the above regulatory requirements and air emission controls will have on future operations  costs  or generating capacity of the company s thermal generating plants is not yet determinable 
pge will seek to recover its share of any associated costs through the ratemaking process 
restoration of salmon runs populations of most salmon species in the pacific northwest have declined significantly over the last several decades 
many of these distinct populations of salmon have been granted protection under the federal endangered species act esa 
long term recovery plans for these species include major 
table of contents operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects 
significant changes thus far include modification in the timing of stored water releases  a spill program to assist juvenile salmon at federal dams located in the columbia river and snake river basins  and continued investment in fish protection infrastructure ladders and screens 
these changes have resulted in reductions at times in hydroelectric generation capability and the seasonal shifting of other generation from the fall and winter periods to the spring and summer periods 
pge is implementing a series of salmon protection measures on the clackamas  deschutes  and willamette rivers that were prescribed by the united states fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service under their authority granted in the esa and are contained in pge s ferc operating licenses 
esa consultations on pge s clackamas river project  completed in  will be in effect until a new license is granted by the ferc 
a settlement agreement related to the license application for the company s four hydroelectric projects on the clackamas river was submitted to the ferc in march for review and approval 
pending issuance of the new license  which is expected to occur in  the project will continue to operate under annual licenses issued by the ferc 
in accordance with a agreement with state and federal agencies  environmental groups  and others  pge is proceeding with the decommissioning of the company s bull run hydroelectric project  which includes the marmot and little sandy dams  located in the sandy river basin 
the marmot dam was removed in july  with removal of the little sandy dam planned for as required under the year license that the ferc issued to pge in for its pelton round butte project on the deschutes river  pge began construction of a selective water withdrawal system in late in an effort to restore fish passage on the upper portion of the river 
the system will collect juvenile salmon and steelhead and allow them to bypass the dam when migrating to the pacific ocean  and will regulate downstream water temperature 
completion of the system  at a total cost of approximately million to million  is expected in pge s portion of the cost is expected to be approximately million  including afdc 
hazardous waste pge has a comprehensive program to comply with requirements of both federal and state regulations related to hazardous waste storage  handling and disposal 
the handling and disposal of hazardous waste from pge facilities is subject to regulation under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
in addition  the use  disposal  and clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  contained in certain electrical equipment  is regulated by the federal toxic substances control act 
pge is also subject to regulation under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  also referred to as superfund 
cercla can assert joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs regardless of fault or legality of original conduct 
pge is currently listed by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites discussed below 
other hazardous waste spills are considered minor  with clean ups conducted on a regular basis 
nuclear fuel disposal under the nuclear waste policy act of  the us department of energy usdoe is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
pge has contracted with the usdoe for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel for trojan 
trojan spent nuclear fuel is stored in the independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi  an nrc approved interim dry storage facility that 
table of contents houses the fuel at the plant site until the permanent off site storage is available 
no federal repository is expected to be available until after for further information concerning pge s nuclear fuel disposal  see note  trojan nuclear plant  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
epa actions pge is currently involved in two matters  known as portland harbor and harbor oil  both of which have been included by the epa on the federal national priority list as federal superfund sites pursuant to cercla 
in  pge  along with sixty eight other prps on the portland harbor initial general notice list  received a notice of potential liability from the epa with respect to the portland harbor superfund site 
a investigation of a portion of the willamette river by the epa  known as portland harbor  revealed significant contamination of sediments within the harbor 
in january  pge received a request from the epa to provide additional information concerning its properties in or near the portland harbor superfund site 
sufficient information is currently not available to determine either the total cost of the investigation and remediation of the portland harbor or the liability of the prps  including pge 
in  pge received a special notice letter for remedial investigation feasibility study from the epa  in which the company was named as one of fourteen prps with respect to the harbor oil superfund site  located in north portland 
harbor oil is the location of a company  harbor oil  inc  that pge and other entities used to process used oil from power plants and electrical distribution systems from at least until sufficient information is currently not available to determine either the total cost of the investigation and remediation of the harbor oil site or the liability of the prps  including pge 
for further information regarding these two matters  see environmental matters in note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
risk factors certain risks and uncertainties that may affect pge s business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows  or that may cause the company s actual results to vary from the forward looking statements contained in the annual report on form k  include those set forth below 
pge is subject to the risk that the opuc will not allow sufficient recovery of the company s costs and thus not provide a reasonable rate of return to shareholders 
the prices that the opuc allows pge to charge for its retail services is the major factor in determining the company s operating income  financial position  liquidity  and credit ratings 
the opuc has the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred 
further  the regulatory process does not provide assurance that pge will be able to achieve earnings levels authorized 
the opuc order in the company s recent comprehensive general rate case  issued in january  approved the use of a pcam by which pge can adjust future prices to reflect a portion of the difference between each year s forecasted and actual nvpc 
however  use of the approved cost sharing deadband methodology will require that pge absorb some power cost increases before the company is allowed to recover any amount from customers 
accordingly  future application of the pcam is expected to only partially mitigate the potentially adverse financial impact of unplanned generating plant outages  severe weather  reduced hydro availability  and volatile wholesale energy prices 
pge faces regulatory and litigation risk with respect to recovery of the company s investment in the closed trojan nuclear plant 
there remains uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to pge s recovery of its investment in the trojan nuclear plant  which was closed in for further information  see trojan investment recovery within legal matters of note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
however  while management believes that it will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of the company  it may have a material adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows for future reporting periods 
the effects of weather on electricity usage can adversely affect operating results 
weather conditions can adversely affect pge s revenues and costs and have an impact on the company s financial and operating results 
temperatures outside the normal range can affect customer demand for electricity  with warmer than normal winters or cooler than normal summers reducing energy sales and revenues 
particularly for residential customers  weather conditions are the dominant cause of usage variations from normal seasonal patterns 
severe weather can also disrupt energy delivery and damage the company s distribution system 
rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected adverse weather changes  particularly if coupled with transmission constraints  could adversely impact pge s cost and ability to meet the energy needs of its customers 
conversely  rapid decreases in load requirements could result in the sale of excess energy at depressed market prices 

table of contents unplanned outages at pge s generating plants can increase the cost of power required to serve customers because the cost of replacement power purchased in the wholesale market generally exceeds the company s cost of generation 
unplanned outages at the company s generating plants could result in replacement power costs greater than those power costs included in customer prices  and any inability to recover such costs in future rates could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
as indicated above  application of the company s pcam can be expected to mitigate adverse financial impacts of future unplanned outages at the company s generating plants 
weather conditions that reduce stream flows could adversely affect the company s hydro production and increase the company s generation or power purchase costs required to meet the shortfall 
pge derives a portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities and from those owned by certain public utility districts in the state of washington and the city of portland  with whom the company has long term power purchase contracts 
regional rainfall and snow pack levels affect stream flows and the resulting amount of generation available from these facilities 
shortfalls in low cost hydro production will require increased generation from the company s higher cost thermal plants and or power purchases in the wholesale market  the adverse financial effects of which are not expected to be fully mitigated by the company s pcam 
wholesale energy markets are subject to forces that are often not predictable and which can result in price volatility  deterioration of liquidity  and general market disruption  adversely affecting pge s costs and ability to manage its energy portfolio and procure required energy supply 
wholesale electricity prices in the western united states are influenced primarily by factors related to supply and demand 
these factors include the adequacy of generating capacity  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  hydroelectric generation levels  prices and availability of fuel sources for generation  disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities  weather conditions  economic growth  and changes in technology 
volatility in wholesale energy markets can affect the availability and price of purchased power and demand for energy 
changes in the creditworthiness of large wholesale customers can also affect pge s variable power costs 
further  disruption in wholesale markets may result in a deterioration of market liquidity  increase the risk of counterparty default  affect the regulatory and legislative process in unpredictable ways  affect wholesale energy prices  and impair pge s ability to manage its energy portfolio 
changes in wholesale energy prices also affect the market value of derivative instruments and unrealized gains and losses  as well as cash requirements to purchase electricity 
although the company s pcam can be expected to partially mitigate the financial effects of adverse wholesale market conditions  cost sharing features of the mechanism do not provide for full recovery in customer prices 
market risk related to adverse fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchased as fuel for electricity generation can also impact the company s results of operations 
pge purchases natural gas in the open market or pursuant to short term or variable price contracts as part of its normal business operations 
if market prices rise  especially during periods when the company requires greater than expected volumes that must be purchased at market or short term prices  pge may incur greater costs than originally estimated 
the company may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through ratemaking 

table of contents sustained downturns in the economy in its service territory could reduce demand for electricity and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
current and projected slowing of the oregon and national economies could result in reduced demand for electricity that could decrease earnings and cash flow 
economic conditions can also impact the company s ability to collect accounts receivable 
measures required to comply with state and federal regulations related to emissions from thermal electric generating plants could result in increased capital expenditures and changes to the company s operations that could increase operating costs  reduce generating capacity and adversely affect pge s results of operations 
oregon and federal regulators are currently considering the air emission standards applicable to pge s thermal generating plants in oregon as part of separate regulatory processes related to haze  mercury  and the company s air permits 
oregon regulators have adopted measures that will require installation of mercury controls at the boardman coal plant 
additional emissions controls may be required at pge s boardman coal plant  although specific measures will depend on the outcome of the regulators reviews 
for further information regarding the total costs and the company s portion  see environmental matters in item business 
in addition  pge may be subject to litigation brought by environmental groups and other private parties alleging violations of state or federal law and seeking the imposition of penalties  injunctive relief  and the closure of plants 
on january   pge received a notice of intent to sue from a coalition of environmental groups alleging violations of the clean air act and the oregon state implementation plan relating to boardman 
the company has not yet fully evaluated the claims referenced in the notice and cannot determine at this time its estimated exposure  if any 
if the plaintiffs file their complaint and articulate their claims in greater detail  pge will be better able to assess the likelihood  if any  that the claims will have a material adverse effect on the company 
montana regulators have adopted strict requirements related to mercury emissions that could impact the operations of colstrip  in which pge has a ownership interest in units and although the full impact of required state and federal remediation measures is not yet determinable  they could have an adverse effect on future operations  operating costs  and generating capacity at both boardman and colstrip 
adverse changes in the company s credit ratings may negatively affect its access to the capital markets and cost of funds 
access to capital markets is important to pge s ability to operate 
increased scrutiny of the energy industry and the impacts of regulation  as well as changes in the company s financial performance  could result in credit agencies re examining its credit rating 
a ratings downgrade could increase the interest rates and fees on pge s revolving credit facility  increasing the cost of funding day to day working capital requirements  and could also require the company to pay higher interest rates on future long term debt 
in addition  access to the commercial paper market  a principle source of short term borrowings  could be restricted  resulting in higher interest costs 
the company s secured and unsecured debt is currently rated at investment grade by moody s investors service and standard and poor s 
should moody s and or standard and poor s reduce their rating on the company s unsecured debt to below investment grade  pge could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral 

table of contents failure of the company s wholesale suppliers to perform their contractual obligations could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver electricity and increase the company s costs 
the company relies on suppliers to deliver natural gas  coal and electricity  in accordance with short and long term contracts 
failure of suppliers to comply with existing contracts in a timely manner  could disrupt pge s ability to deliver electricity and require the company to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of its customers 
in addition  as these contractual agreements expire  pge may be unable to continue to purchase natural gas  coal or electricity on terms and conditions equivalent to those of current agreements 
cost and availability of fuel supplies  primarily natural gas and coal  can also impact the cost and output of the company s thermal generating plants 
the construction of new generating facilities  or modifications to existing facilities  may be subject to risks that result in disallowance of certain costs for recovery in prices  reduced plant efficiency  or higher operating costs 
increases in both the number of customers and demand for energy will require continued expansion and reinforcement of pge s generation  transmission  and distribution systems 
construction of new generating facilities  or modifications to existing facilities  may be affected by various factors  including unanticipated delays and cost increases  which could result in the disallowance of certain costs in the rate determination process 
in addition  if construction projects are not completed according to specifications  reduced plant efficiency and higher operating costs could result 
equipment failure  the ability of generating plants to operate as intended  and other factors can result in plant performance that falls below expected levels 
capital expenditures and changes in operations required to comply with both existing and new environmental laws related to fish and wildlife could adversely affect pge s results of operations 
a portion of pge s total energy requirement is comprised of generation from hydroelectric projects on the columbia  clackamas  deschutes  willamette  and sandy rivers 
operations of these projects are subject to extensive regulation related to the protection of fish and wildlife 
the listing of various species of salmon  wildlife  and plants as threatened or endangered species has resulted in significant changes to federally authorized activities  including those of hydroelectric projects 
salmon recovery plans could include further major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects  including those owned by pge and those from which the company purchases power under long term contracts 
in addition  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to such facilities  which could further increase required expenditures for salmon recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydro generation available to meet the company s energy requirements 
legislative efforts to reduce carbon emissions  in response to concerns related to climate change and global warming  could lead to increased capital and operating costs and have an adverse impact on the company s operations and operating results 
the outcome of legislative efforts regarding carbon dioxide emissions  whether at the federal  regional  or state level  or the timing of any such laws or regulations that may be enacted  could have a material adverse affect on future results of operations and cash flows unless the additional costs incurred to comply with such laws or regulations can be recovered through regulated rates and or future market prices for electricity 
the company would seek to recover through the ratemaking process any capital and operating costs of additional emission control equipment or emission reduction measures  such as the cost of sequestration or purchasing allowances  or offset credits that may be required 

table of contents pge is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings  the outcome of which is uncertain  and resolution adverse to pge could adversely affect the company s cash flows  financial condition or results of operations

these actions are subject to many uncertainties and management cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
the final resolution of some of the matters in which the company is involved could require the company to make additional expenditures  in excess of established reserves  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on pge s cash flows and results of operations 
similarly  the terms of resolution could require the company to change its business practices and procedures  which could also have an adverse affect on pge s cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
certain legal and regulatory proceedings  such as the proceedings related to refunds on wholesale market transactions in the pacific northwest described in note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in item legal proceedings  may have an adverse affect on results of operations and cash flows for future reporting periods

however  changes in these regulations can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the company s costs 
pge has an aging workforce with a significant number of employees approaching retirement age 
the company anticipates higher than previous averages of retirement rates over the next ten years and may need to replace a significant number of employees in key positions 
pge s ability to successfully implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon the company s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers 
without a skilled workforce  the company s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be tested and could affect operating results 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures 
pge is currently involved in renewing the federal license for its hydroelectric projects on the clackamas river 
the ferc  under the federal power act  may impose conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters in connection with the renewal of pge s license 
the company cannot predict with certainty the requirements that may be imposed during the relicensing process  the economic impact of those requirements  whether a new license will ultimately be issued or whether pge will be willing to meet the relicensing requirements to continue operating its clackamas hydroelectric projects 

table of contents storms and other natural disasters could damage the company s facilities and disrupt its delivery of electricity resulting in significant property loss or repair costs and customer dissatisfaction 
the company has exposure to natural disasters that can cause significant physical damage to its generation  transmission  and distribution facilities 
such events can interrupt the delivery of electricity  increase repair and service restoration expenses  and reduce revenues 
such events  if repeated or prolonged  can also affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight

table of contents in a separate action  on march   the california attorney general filed a complaint the lockyer case with the ferc against various sellers in the wholesale power market  alleging that the ferc s authorization of market based rates violated the federal power act fpa  and  even if market based rates were valid under the fpa  that the quarterly transaction reports required to be filed by sellers  including pge  did not contain the transaction specific information mandated by the fpa and the ferc 
the complaint argued that refunds for amounts charged between market based rates and cost based rates should be ordered 
the ferc denied the challenge to market based rates and refused to order refunds  but did require sellers  including pge  to re file their quarterly reports to include transaction specific data 
the california attorney general appealed the ferc s decision to the ninth circuit 
on september   the court issued an opinion upholding the ferc s authority to approve market based tariffs  but also holding that the ferc had the authority to order refunds  if quarterly filing of market based sales transactions had not been properly made

table of contents overview pge is a vertically integrated electric utility engaged in the generation  purchase  transmission  distribution  and retail sale of electricity in the state of oregon  as well as the wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas in the western united states and canada 
the company generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its service territory 
the company s revenues and income from operations are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity  price changes  customer usage patterns  and the availability and price of purchased power and fuel 
pge is a winter peaking utility that typically experiences its highest retail energy sales during the winter heating season  with a slightly lower peak in the summer that generally results from air conditioning demand 
customers as of december   the company served approximately  retail customers  a increase from the end of the number of residential and commercial customers both increased during  with total retail energy deliveries up for the year 
this growth was the result of continued economic expansion  as oregon s non farm employment seasonally adjusted grew in and the state s unemployment rate seasonally adjusted was down slightly from the company expects weather adjusted retail loads to increase in  with higher commercial demand and increased deliveries to industrial customers  including new solar panel manufacturers  expected to more than offset slower growth in the housing market and lower residential use resulting from conservation and energy efficiency efforts
