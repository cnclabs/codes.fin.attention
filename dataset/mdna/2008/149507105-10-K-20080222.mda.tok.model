item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands overview cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries produce  sell  and finance manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
since the beginning of  the industry has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a severe reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels  each of which contributed to a reduction in wholesale industry shipments to a year low in in june  we entered into contracts totaling approximately  to build and deliver a total of homes to the mississippi emergency management agency mema under the alternative housing pilot program as part of that state s ongoing efforts to provide permanent and semi permanent housing for residents displaced by hurricane katrina 
we recorded revenue of  on homes shipped during and expect to ship the remaining homes during the first quarter of in late january  we received an order to build and deliver an additional homes under the mema contract  which we expect to deliver in the first and second quarters of during  we entered into agreements as a subcontractor to provide  homes to the federal emergency management agency fema as part of that agency s hurricane relief efforts 
revenue for shipments of homes to fema under these agreements was recorded in the last two quarters of and the first quarter of shipments under these agreements had a significant impact on our results of operations and the manufactured housing industry during these three quarters 
industry company shipments and market share based on information provided by mhi  wholesale floor shipments of hud code homes were down cumulatively from the year ended december  through december  as shown by the data in the following table floor shipments nationwide cavalier s core states year industry increase decrease from prior year cavalier increase decrease from prior year market share industry increase decrease from prior year cavalier increase decrease from prior year market share during  our floor shipments decreased as compared to  while industry wide shipments decreased  with our market share in increasing to 
in our core states  our market share in increased to from in due to new products we introduced in early and our participation in the mema alternative housing pilot program 
modular housing we primarily produce hud code homes 
we also produce modular homes  which are constructed to local  regional or state building codes 
modular homes generally have a different and more complex roof system than hud code homes  are typically two or more sections  and  when combined with land  usually qualify for traditional mortgage financing  which generally has better terms than financing for a hud code home 
the national market for modular housing was  homes in according to the national modular housing council nmhc 
modular homes shipped industry wide in decreased from and continued to decline in the first nine months of the latest data available with total shipments in this period of  homes  a decrease from the first nine months of we shipped and modular homes during and  respectively  for a year over year decrease of 
we believe the decline in modular home shipments may be attributable to the general downturn in the real estate market and tightening credit standards  since modular homes typically are more expensive and represent closer competition for site built homes  which have also experienced a decline 

table of contents industry finance environment a major factor that impacts the manufactured housing industry is the availability of credit and the tightening relaxation of credit standards 
in more recent years  the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry 
in  the mortgage credit markets experienced a significant upheaval related to sub prime mortgages that appears to have impacted  or may impact in the future  the overall credit markets 
more restrictive credit standards will impact the ability of home buyers to obtain financing and the downturn in the real estate markets have increased home repossessions 
we believe these factors are also impacting the manufactured housing industry  particularly modular housing 
we believe a meaningful expansion for our industry will be delayed until there is substantial entry of finance resources to the manufactured housing market 
raw materials cost and gross margin in  our gross margin decreased in large part due to production inefficiencies we experienced early in the year related to new product introductions and later in the year as a result of the complex design and product specifications of the mema homes 
due to continued increases in crude oil prices  we continued to experience pricing pressure on all petrochemical based raw materials 
other steel and steel or copper related raw materials also continued to increase on a monthly basis 
in general  commodity materials remained stable throughout  and we believe they will be stable in unless another major natural disaster significantly increases demand for these material 
while we seek to offset rising costs through increasing our selling prices  sudden increases in raw material costs  coupled with dealers order backlogs  can affect the timing and our ability to pass on these cost increases 
we are uncertain at this time as to the impact the extent and duration of the increased costs will have on our future revenue and earnings 
capacity and overhead cost our plants operated at capacities ranging from to in we closed one of two manufacturing lines in millen  georgia in september and consolidated our winfield  alabama production line with our operations in hamilton  alabama 
these actions reduced our number of operating home manufacturing facilities from seven at december  to five as of december  we will continue to monitor the relationship between demand and capacity and may take additional steps to adjust our capacity or enhance our operations based on our views of the industry and its general direction 
outlook we believed the substantial hurricane damage in the gulf coast region in and would create opportunities for our industry beyond the temporary housing supplied through fema orders 
we further expected the strain on conventional home building resources would likely cause some of those looking to replace damaged homes to consider manufactured housing  including modular homes  as a viable alternative to traditional site built housing 
we expected rebuilding efforts to impose greater strains on the availability of certain building materials  which would likely result in increased costs 
the contract we entered into with mema to deliver homes is an example of these opportunities 
however  additional opportunities for our industry in this region have been much slower in developing than we had originally anticipated 
we find it difficult to predict the timing of the recovery effort due to issues associated with zoning  insurance settlements  flood plain restrictions  customer and community acceptance of manufactured housing  as well as local economic conditions 
in  we will continue to focus on programs to improve manufacturing efficiencies  increase gross margins  and to reduce costs 
was a very challenging year for our industry  and we do not anticipate any meaningful improvement as the overall economy struggles with the crisis in the credit markets  which may have been one of the factors that contributed to the continued decline in industry home shipments in further changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer purchases  availability of adequate financing sources  increases in repossessions or dealer failures and further commodity price increases could affect our results of operations

table of contents gross profit gross profit was  or of total revenue for  versus  or of total revenue in the  decrease in gross profit and basis points decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of lower sales volume  especially in the last half of the year  and increased raw material prices 
gross profit was favorably impacted in by higher production levels of a large number of homes with like specifications for the fema related orders  primarily in the fourth quarter

general corporate operating expense  which is not identifiable to a specific segment  decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreased incentive compensation costs 
other income expense interest expense decreased in to  from  in primarily due to lower levels of borrowings  including the march repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit of  which we borrowed in the fourth quarter of to fund short term cash requirements to complete the fema order

realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including anticipated operating results  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning strategies 

table of contents in  our assessment of the valuation allowance considered the following factors our operating performance  which was significantly below previous projections  a year industry low in for shipments of manufactured housing with each quarter s shipments lower than the previous quarter  projected shipments for that could be relatively flat compared to shipments  and our lack of visibility with respect to our results 
due to these factors  we recorded an adjustment to our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets  which totaled  as of december in  as a result of continuing improvements in operating performance and projected income and tax liability for  we reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and realized  in deferred tax benefits

general liquidity and debt agreements historically  we have funded our operating activities with cash flows from operations supplemented by available cash on hand and  when necessary  funds from our credit facility 
we also benefited from the proceeds of sales of idle facilities as a replacement source of funds due to net operating losses 
currently  we have two previously idled facilities that are being marketed for sale 
in january  we entered into an agreement to sell one of these facilities for  subject to the completion of due diligence by the buyer 
this sale is currently scheduled to close by the end of february we cannot predict whether  when or at what amounts the remaining idle facilities may ultimately be sold 
in june  we entered into agreements to provide homes to the mississippi emergency management agency mema as part of that state s ongoing efforts to provide permanent and semi permanent housing for residents displaced by hurricane katrina 
in order to fund our short term cash needs required to produce these homes  we amended our credit facility the credit facility on june  with our primary lender to increase the revolving line of credit component during the period from june  through february  the temporary advance period from  to the lesser of  or the collateral loan value as defined in the credit facility  effectively waiving temporarily the tangible net worth requirement listed in the following table

the credit facility contains certain restrictive and financial covenants which  among other things  limit our ability without the lender s consent to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed in the aggregate  iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate  excluding floor plan notes payable which cannot exceed  and iv make annual capital expenditures of  for the year ended december  and thereafter

we were not in compliance with the cash flow to debt service ratio covenant for the year ended december   but we obtained a waiver from our lender for noncompliance with this annually measured covenant 
we were in compliance with all other debt covenants as of december  in february  subsequent to year end  we further amended the terms of the credit facility to  among other things  i extend the maturity date to april  ii revise the amount available under the revolving credit line to  and eliminate the tiered availability based on tnw shown above  iii revise the interest rate as follows tnw greater than  prime less  tnw from  to  prime  tnw from  to  prime plus  and tnw less than  prime plus  and iv modify certain financial covenants as follows maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  maintain a current ratio of at least to  maintain minimum cash and cash equivalents of  achieve an annual cash flow to debt service ratio of not less than to  and achieve an annual minimum profitability of we have amounts outstanding under industrial development revenue bond issues bonds which totaled  and  at december  and december   respectively

since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amount of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
from time to time  we evaluate the potential to sell all or a portion of our remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
cis re sells loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
we believe the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase our liquidity  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and enhance our ability to increase our volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that we will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
at december   we sold a portion of our portfolio held for investment totaling  with cash settlement in early january 
table of contents we believe existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund our operations and plans for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  or if we are unable to remain in compliance with our covenants under our credit facility  we would seek to maintain or enhance our liquidity position and capital resources through modifications to or waivers under the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond our control 
cash to be provided by operations in the coming year is largely dependent on sales volume 
our manufactured homes are sold mainly through independent dealers who generally rely on third party lenders to provide floor plan financing for homes purchased 
in addition  third party lenders generally provide consumer financing for manufactured home purchases 
our sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing for manufactured home purchasers and dealers as well as our own retail locations 
the availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry  the departure of financial institutions from the industry  the financial institutions lending practices  the strength of the credit markets in general  governmental policies  and other conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
throughout the past nine years the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
unfavorable changes in these factors and terms of financing in the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements our material off balance sheet arrangements consist of repurchase obligations and letters of credit 
each of these arrangements is discussed below under contractual obligations and commitments

we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  based on prior experience and an evaluation of dealers financial conditions 
we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our surety bonds and insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
the outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under our credit facility 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies 
critical accounting estimates we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements as summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors  current economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product warranties we provide the initial retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical sales amounts and warranty costs related to homes sold and any outstanding service work orders 
we have a reserve for estimated warranties of  and  
although we maintain reserves for such claims  based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims or per claim costs exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
insurance our workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance coverages are generally provided under incurred loss  retrospectively rated premium plans 
under these plans  we incur insurance expense based upon various rates applied to current payroll costs and sales 
annually  such insurance expense is adjusted by the carrier for loss experience factors subject to minimum and maximum premium calculations 
refunds or additional premiums are estimated and recorded when sufficiently reliable data is available 
we were contingently liable at december  for future retrospective premium adjustments and recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  related to these contingent claims 
claims exceeding our current expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
reserve for repurchase commitments manufactured housing companies customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions  which provide wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
a majority of our sales are made to dealers located primarily in the south central and south atlantic regions of the united states pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions 
these agreements generally provide that we will repurchase our new products from the lending institutions in the event of dealer default 
our risk of loss under repurchase agreements is reduced by the following factors sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of sales in  excluding mema fema related sales  the price that we are obligated to pay under such repurchase agreements declines based on predetermined amounts over the period of the agreement generally to months  and we historically have been able to resell homes repurchased from lenders 

table of contents we apply fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to account for our liability for repurchase commitments 
under the provisions of fin  issuance of a guarantee results in two different types of obligations a non contingent obligation to stand ready to perform under the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to fin and a contingent obligation to make future payments under the conditions of the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to sfas no 

we review the retail dealers inventory to estimate the amount of inventory subject to repurchase obligation which is used to calculate the fair value of the non contingent obligation for repurchase commitments and the contingent liability based on historical information available at the time 
during the period in which a home is sold inception of a repurchase commitment  we record the greater of these two calculations as a liability for repurchase commitments and as a reduction to revenue 
we estimate the fair value of the non contingent portion of our manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment under the provisions of fin when a home is shipped to dealers whose floor plan financing includes our repurchase commitment 
the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement has been estimated on a pooled dealer approach based on the creditworthiness of the independent dealers  as determined by the floor plan institution  and is derived using an income approach 
specifically  the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement is determined by calculating the net present value of the difference in a the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the prevailing floor plan note interest rate and b the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the interest rate of a similar type loan without a manufacturer s repurchase agreement in force 
we estimate the contingent obligation to make future payments under our manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment for the same pool of commitments as used in the fair value calculation above and record the greater of the two calculations 
this sfas no 
contingent obligation is estimated using historical loss factors  including the frequency of repurchases and the losses we experienced for repurchased inventory 
additionally  subsequent to the inception of the repurchase commitment  we evaluate the likelihood that we will be called on to perform under the inventory repurchase commitments 
if it becomes probable that a dealer will default and a sfas no 
loss reserve should be recorded  then such contingent liability is recorded equal to the estimated loss on repurchase 
based on identified changes in dealers financial conditions  we evaluate the probability of default for the group of dealers who are identified at an elevated risk of default and apply a probability of default to the group  based on historical default rates 
in this default probability evaluation  we review repurchase notifications received from floor plan sources and review our dealer inventory for expected repurchase notifications based on various communications from the lenders and the dealers as well as for dealers who  we believe  are experiencing financial difficulty 
our repurchase commitments for the dealers in the category of elevated risk of default are excluded from the pool of commitments used in both of the calculations at and above 
changes in the reserve are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
following the inception of the commitment  the recorded reserve is reduced over the repurchase period and is eliminated on the earlier of the date the dealer sells the home or the commitment expires 
the maximum amount for which we are contingently liable under repurchase agreements approximated  and  at december  and  respectively 
we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  
changes in the level of retail inventories in the manufactured housing industry  either up or down  can have a significant impact on our operating results 
the deterioration in the availability of retail financing experienced in recent years  along with significant competition from repossessed homes  extended the inventory adjustment period for excess industry retail inventory levels beyond what was originally expected 
if these trends were to continue  or if retail demand were to significantly weaken  the inventory overhang could result in even greater intense price competition  cause further pressure on profit margins within the industry  and have a material adverse effect on us 
the inventory of cavalier manufactured homes at all retail locations decreased in from and increased in from the changes in retail inventory  and corresponding changes in repurchase commitments  have been impacted in the last several years by the leveling of retail inventory with demand 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed above  the manufactured housing industry has experienced an overall market decline since the latter part of due to the overall reduction in units sold  we have idled  closed or sold manufactured housing facilities  a portion of our insurance and premium finance business  a portion of our supply operations and under performing retail locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including other intangible assets  when events 
table of contents and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than our carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived assets 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair market values are based primarily on independent appraisals and preliminary or definitive contractual arrangements less costs to dispose 
we recorded impairment charges totaling in based on our estimates of fair values for certain equipment idled in connection with the closing of the winfield  alabama facility 
deferred tax asset realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in  we reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and realized  in deferred tax benefits as a result of continued improvements in operating performance in that year and projected income and tax liability for in  we again reviewed information available to us  including the decline in home shipments to a year industry low  our anticipated operating results in  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and our view of industry conditions 
based on this evaluation  we reestablished a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  under the standards of sfas no 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future  which may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance of  related party transactions we purchased raw materials of approximately   and  from msr forest products  llc during  and  respectively  which is a company in which we own a minority interest 
we recorded net income of investees accounted for by the equity method of   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we used the services of a law firm  lowe  mobley lowe  a partner of which  mr 
john w lowe  is one of our directors 
we paid legal fees to this firm of   and 
in addition  this law firm received an indirect legal fee payment of in from the proceeds of the settlement of one of our claims 
impact of inflation we generally have been able to increase our selling prices to offset increased costs  including the costs of raw materials 
however  as the number of units shipped by the manufactured housing industry continues to decline  downward pressures on selling prices may not allow us to increase our selling prices to cover any increases in costs 
sudden increases in costs as well as price competition  however  can affect our ability to increase our selling prices 
we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability  but can give no assurance that this trend will continue in the future

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments  but are not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we purchase retail installment contracts from our dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resell a majority of these loans to financial institutions under the terms of retail finance agreements 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time 
our portfolio consisted of fixed rate contracts with interest rates generally ranging from to and an average original term of months at december  we estimated the fair value of our installment contracts receivable at  using discounted cash flows and interest rates offered by cis on similar contracts at december  we have one industrial development revenue bond issue that is exposed to interest rate changes 
since this borrowing is floating rate debt  an increase in short term interest rates would adversely affect interest expense
