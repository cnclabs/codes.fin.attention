overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets  designing and manufacturing standard  modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components  thermal management products  and accessories 
in  we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling billion 
our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense  security  medical and networking 
we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and the highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry in north america 
from mid through  the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the datacommunication and telecommunication markets 
from through  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products and higher demand in targeted markets 
key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in the future the housing market and new pool starts slowed in the last three quarters of and continued to shrink in we believe that construction of new homes and new pools starts in north america affects approximately of our sales  especially for our pool and spa businesses 
this downturn will likely have an adverse impact on our revenues for the telecommunication equipment market  particularly in north america  has slowed over the past year and a half and impacted north american electronics sales within our technical products group 
for the full year  north american electronics sales declined approximately when compared with the revenue decrease was attributable to telecommunication industry consolidation which has delayed enclosure product sales and some oem datacommunication programs reaching end of life 
based on some recovery of telecommunications equipment procurement in the second half of  we anticipate continuing improvement in and growth rates in the low double digits for our north american electronics sales 
a weak economy in the united states and europe could reduce the telecommunications capital investments and therefore our anticipated revenue growth 
we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
end user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august 
the magnitude of 
table of contents the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and weather patterns  particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 
we expect our operations to continue to benefit from our pims initiatives  which include strategy deployment  lean enterprise with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management and lean operations  and ignite  our process to drive organic growth 
we are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses 
we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases we have experienced in base materials such as stainless steel  carbon steel and copper and other costs such as health care and other employee benefit costs 
if sales of products into residential end markets in our water business continue to slow appreciably  we may consider reducing our investments and consequentially organic growth in those markets and further restructure our operations by closing or downsizing facilities  reducing headcount or taking other market related actions as we did in and we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of our net income 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
free cash flow for the full year was approximately million  or of our net income 
see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources in this report 
we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on net sales in our currency effect is primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may or may not trend favorably in the future 
the effective tax rate for was 
the tax rate for includes a favorable adjustment related to the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for changes in german tax law enacted on august  we estimate our effective income tax rate for the full year to be between and 
we continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate 
the tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following continue to drive operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives  with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management  and lean operations  continue the integration of acquisitions and realize identified synergistic opportunities  continue proactive talent development  particularly in international management and other key functional areas  achieve organic sales growth in excess of market growth rates  particularly in international markets  and continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our existing platforms in our water and technical products groups 
on february   we reaffirmed our previously issued fiscal guidance  which anticipates our earnings per share growth between and to approximately to per share 
our estimate is based on three primary variables 
first  we anticipate modest organic growth in the range of to  including some price and product mix improvements  bringing our total revenues to to billion for the full year 
second  we anticipate that our manufacturing productivity initiatives  in particular our materials sourcing programs  will improve through our lean enterprise initiatives and through somewhat higher unit volumes 
third  we anticipate our selling  marketing and r d expenses will flex with economic conditions in our primary markets 

table of contents if economic conditions worsen in north america and europe  then we expect that our sales and productivity increases may deteriorate from current forecast 
in that event  we would reduce discretionary selling  marketing and r d costs in order to minimize the impact of these declines on our earnings per share  which we anticipate would still meet the bottom of our guidance range 
conversely  if economic conditions hold up and improve over the year  we expect our net income should be able to reach the top of our guidance range 
we would then have the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling  marketing and r d efforts to maximize organic sales growth in and sustain anticipated growth in we based our guidance on an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in as noted above  in our objectives may seek to expand our geographic reach internationally  expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses capabilities to serve additional markets 
we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 
the ability to achieve our operating objectives and guidance will depend  to a certain extent  on factors outside our control

at the same time  standard poor s affirmed its long term debt rating of bbb 
standard poor s stated that the outlook revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit metrics that would result from the acquisition of porous media 
the negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if financial policies become more aggressive or if operating results are weaker than expected 
we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations  or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers  or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we issue short term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of  million in total indebtedness and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was  compared with at december  our targeted debt to total capital ratio is or less 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt  and to pay dividends to shareholders 
in order to meet these cash requirements  we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds  and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
we paid dividends in of million  compared with million in and million in we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis
