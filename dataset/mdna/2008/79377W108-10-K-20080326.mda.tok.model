the maximum contingent payment had the agreement been terminated early at february  would have been approximately million 
management believes the risk of incurring a contingent payment is remote 
in september of the company entered into agreements with hsbc and mastercard international incorporated to issue a co branded mastercard card to new and existing proprietary credit card customers 
under this program  qualifying customers are issued a sfa and mastercard branded credit card that functions as a traditional proprietary credit card when used at any sfa or off fifth store and at saks direct or as a mastercard when used at any unaffiliated location that accepts mastercard cards 
hsbc establishes and owns the co brand accounts  retains the benefits and sales associated with the ownership of the accounts  receives the finance charge and other income from the accounts  and incurs the bad debts associated with the accounts 
capital needs the company estimates capital expenditures for will be approximately million  net of any proceeds  primarily for store expansions and renovations  enhancements to management information systems  maintenance capital and replacement capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that working capital requirements related to existing stores  store expansions  store renovations and capital expenditures will be funded through cash on hand  cash provided by operations and the revolving credit agreement 
maximum availability under the revolving credit agreement is million 
there is no debt rating trigger 
during periods in which availability under the agreement exceeds million  the company is not subject to financial covenants 
if availability under the agreement were to decrease to less than million  the company would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to during  weighted average letters of credit issued under this credit agreement were million 
the highest amount of letters of credit outstanding under the agreement during was million 
the company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities combined with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement in order to sustain its current levels of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns occur within a matter of days of the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation  excluding depreciation and amortization the company s inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail prices for merchandise held for sale too high  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over forty percent of the company s assets at february  are represented by investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company principally utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
when constructing stores  the company receives allowances from landlords 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain events  annually 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during the year ended february   february  and january   the company incurred net charges of million  million  and million  respectively  related to asset impairments and other costs in the normal course of business 
leases the company leases stores  distribution centers  and administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space and includes such rent expense in store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s deferred tax assets at february  consist of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during  the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards was reduced based on projections of future profitability 
at february  the company believes that it will be sufficiently profitable during the periods from to to utilize all of its federal nols and a portion of its state nols 
to the extent management s estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction are greater than or less than management s current estimates  future increases or decreases in the benefit for net operating losses could occur 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state and local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
audit authorities may question the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
during  an additional reserve of million was established for issues raised in current state tax examinations and previously filed federal tax returns relating to prior periods 
during  the company concluded a federal income tax examination for the and tax years and concluded a number of state income tax examinations as well which resulted in a decrease in the amount previously accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions of million 
at february   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
the company adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective as of the beginning of fiscal year as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 the company recorded a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to the beginning shareholder s equity 
including the cumulative effect decrease  at the beginning and ending of the company had approximately million and million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
of these totals  million and million net of the federal benefit on state issues represents the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next twelve months as a result of settling uncertain tax positions 
however  the company does not anticipate this to result in any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
as a result of the analysis of uncertain tax positions due to the adoption of fin  the net deferred tax asset related to the state net operating loss carryforwards increased 
therefore  the company performed a valuation allowance analysis to determine the realization of this asset 
this analysis resulted in an additional valuation allowance of million with the offset recorded to shareholders equity in accordance with statement of positions  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
the company is subject to the provisions of statement of position for these net operating losses since these losses were acquired through the acquisition of a company that had previously filed bankruptcy 
the company files a consolidated us federal income tax return as well as state tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions 
the company has completed examinations by the internal revenue service for taxable years through january  with no significant adjustments 
with respect to the state and local jurisdictions  the company has completed examinations in many jurisdictions through the same period and currently has examinations in progress for several jurisdictions 
pension plans pension expense is based on actuarial models used to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to associates and is allocated to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
the company s funding policy provides that contributions to the pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of the company may provide additional contributions from time to time  generally not to exceed the maximum tax deductible limitation 
the pension plans are valued annually on november st 
the projected unit credit method is utilized in recognizing the pension liabilities 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 

the company adopted sfas no 
prospectively on february  this statement requires the company to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
sfas no 
requires the company to recognize all unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax 
such amounts will be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost or income pursuant to the current recognition and amortization provisions 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a pension asset of million and eliminated the prepaid pension asset of million 
based on the funded status of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as of february   the company also recorded a net decrease in aoci of million 
the adoption of sfas no 
on february  had no impact on the company s earnings 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates as of the annual measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration similar to the plan s liabilities as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net pension expense 
at november   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s abo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is approximately million on the abo and approximately 
million on annual pension expense 
to the extent the abo increases  the after tax effect of such increase serves to reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
it is the company s policy to invest approximately of the pension fund assets in equities  in fixed income securities and in real estate 
the company s estimate of the expected long term rate of return considers the historical returns on plan assets  as well as the future expectations of returns on classes of assets within the target asset allocation of the plan asset portfolio 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately years 
the company s expected long term rate of return on assets was in and the assumed average rate of compensation increases is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
this rate is estimated to be for the periods following november  and is utilized principally in calculating the pbo and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a change in the assumed rate of compensation increases would not be material to the pbo or annual pension expense 
inflation and deflation inflation and deflation affect the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its sg a expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation  which has occurred in recent years in sg a  through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of net sales and net income realized during the second half of the fiscal year  which includes the holiday selling season 
in light of these patterns  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first three fiscal quarters of each year  and working capital needs are greater in the last two fiscal quarters of each year 
the increases in working capital needs during the fall season have typically been financed with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
generally  more than of the company s sales are generated during the fourth quarter and a large portion of its operating income is generated during the fall season 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the application of statement by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
for a benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the benefit to be recognized for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
the company adopted fin as of february  during september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or a liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas  until the beginning of our fiscal year  as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit plan and other postretirement plans 
the company adopted sfas no 
prospectively on february  sfas no 
requires an employer that sponsors one or more defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement plans to recognize the funded status of a plan  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation  in the balance sheet  recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end balance sheet  and disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position for the year ended february  additionally  sfas no 
will require the company to change the measurement date for the assets and liabilities of its employee benefit plans from november to the company s fiscal year end beginning with the year ending january  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that currently are not required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective no later than fiscal years beginning on or after november  we believe this statement has an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in business combinations 
sfas r also establishes expanded disclosure requirements for business combinations 
sfas r will become effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this standard outlines the accounting and reporting for ownership interest in a subsidiary held by parties other than the parent 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the fasb is contemplating an amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  that would require the company to ignore the cash presumption of net share settlement and to assume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share 
although the company is now required to ignore the contingent conversion provision on its convertible notes under eitf  it can still presume that it will satisfy the net share settlement upon conversion of the notes in cash  and thus exclude the effect of the conversion of the notes in its calculation of dilutive earnings per share 
if and when the fasb amends sfas no 
 the effect of the changes would require the company to use the if converted method in calculating dilutive earnings per share except when the effect would be anti dilutive 
the effect of adopting the amendment to sfas no 
would increase the number of shares in the company s dilutive calculation by  shares
