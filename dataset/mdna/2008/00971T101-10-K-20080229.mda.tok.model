item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
in recent years  however  we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly  twelve month or longer periods 
our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions that our existing customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than  or at the same rate as  our revenues 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality  price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 
our improved financial results in as compared to and reflect the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed to support such growth

table of contents we were profitable for fiscal years  and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future during each quarter of  the dollar volume of new recurring revenue contracts that we booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues 
during each quarter of  unit prices offered to some new and existing customers declined  including contracts signed with certain customers at higher committed service levels  which contributed to the declining unit prices due to volume discounts 
additionally  increased competition from new entrants into the market that are willing to use low unit prices as a method of differentiation contributed to these price declines 
if we continue to experience decreases in unit prices for new and existing customers  our operating profit percentage could decrease 
during each quarter of  we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers 
additionally  we continue to invest in internal use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total bandwidth costs increased during these periods 
we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  but we anticipate continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in during each quarter of  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we expect that customer concentration levels will continue to decline compared to those in prior years if our customer base continues to grow 
during the year ended december   revenues derived from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues 
we expect revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be between and in as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards at fair value at the time of grant 
for the years ended december  and  our stock based compensation expense was million and million  respectively 
we expect that stock based compensation expense will continue at the current level  or slightly increase in the future  because we have a significant number of unvested employee awards outstanding and plan to continue to grant stock based compensation awards in the future 
as of december   our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock based awards were million  which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of years 
this expense is expected to be recognized through depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased during as compared to due to expected future purchases of network equipment during  we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings and capitalize stock based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects  which would increase the amount of capitalized internal use software costs 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will increase in compared to during the year ended december   our effective income tax rate  including discrete items  was 
while we expect our annual effective income tax rate to remain relatively constant during  we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments due to the continued utilization of our deferred tax assets 

table of contents based on our analysis of  among other things  the aforementioned trends and events  as of the date of this annual report on form k  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during  however  our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including generating positive net income  in any future period 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  capitalized internal use software costs  intangible assets and goodwill  income and other taxes  impairment and useful lives of long lived assets  loss contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenue in accordance with the commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract 
table of contents has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge customers an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive income from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
for most multi element service arrangements to date  the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period provided that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
in limited instances resulting in less than of total revenue in each year reported  we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
as prescribed by this guidance  we apply the residual method of accounting 
the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  be deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements so long as all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage of completion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 long term construction type contracts  and with the applicable guidance provided by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type 
table of contents contracts 
we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project 
in certain customer arrangements  we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract 
the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change 
at the outset of a fixed fee arrangement  if we are not able to estimate the total cost to complete  nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones  we account for the arrangement using the completed contract method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables 
in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed fee contract indicates a loss  we will record the loss immediately 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be objectively established 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  deferred installation and activation set up fees  and amounts billed under extended payment terms 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 
valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities the fair value of our investments and marketable securities is generally determined from quoted market prices based upon transactions in active markets 
we also have investments in auction rate securities that consist entirely of municipal debt securities  recorded at cost  which approximates fair market value unless the auction fails due to their variable interest rates  which reset through an auction process typically every days 
this auction mechanism generally allows existing investors to continue to own their securities with a revised interest 
table of contents rate based on the auction or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
because of these short intervals between interest reset dates  we monitor these auctions to ensure they are successful  which provides evidence that the recorded values of these investments approximate their fair values 
to the extent an auction were to fail such that the securities were deemed to be not liquid  we would need to seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities  which may not be based on quoted market transactions 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  and overall market conditions and trends 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of december  and december  these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of completed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability 
material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  comprised of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during  our management determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized  and  accordingly released substantially all of our valuation allowance 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a twelve quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income at that time 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stock based payments that continue to be classified as equity awards 
additionally  we elected to use the long form method  as provided in paragraph of sfas no 
r  to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
the long form method required us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 subject to adjustments for net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as of the date of adoption  we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties  and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
accounting for stock based compensation since january   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
prior to that date  we recognized stock based compensation costs pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 
 share based payment  in the notes to our financial 
table of contents statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and deferred stock units  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature 
for awards with a performance condition vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the awards expected vesting periods 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increases in revenue during the years presented were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers  the latter leading to increases in the average revenue per customer during each year  partially offset by reduced unit prices offered to new and renewing customers 
we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers  particularly in the media and entertainment segment  is the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services 
we expect this trend to continue in also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december  were revenues generated through our acquisitions of netli and nine systems 
as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to  at december   and  at december  for and  and  respectively  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which and of total revenues  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
for  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which of total revenues was derived from operations in europe 
other than the united states  no single country accounted for or more of our total revenues during these periods 
we expect international sales to increase slightly as a percentage of our overall sales in as compared to prior years 
resellers accounted for of revenues in  in and in for  and  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock based compensation for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software 
cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel stock based compensation depreciation and impairment of network equipment amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit  and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 
additionally  in and  cost of revenues included stock based compensation expense  which increased by million and million  respectively  as compared to and  respectively 
cost of revenues during  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  will vary 
we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
for the years ending december   and  the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co location services are approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  for  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 
additionally  cost of revenues is expected to increase as a result of higher stock based compensation expense due to additional equity awards we expect to grant to network related personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock based compensation for research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  net of impairments 
these development costs consisted of external consulting and payroll and payroll related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
additionally  for the years ended december  and  we 
table of contents capitalized million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
these capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 
research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   as compared million for the year ended december  the research and development expense increases in both and as compared to the prior years were due to increases in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount  as well as additional stock based compensation expense 
the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation capitalized salaries and other total net increase we believe that research and development expenses will increase in  as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make investments in our core technology  develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel  attributable to revenue growth and as a result of higher stock based compensation expense  particularly for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in sales and marketing expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation marketing and related costs other expense total net increase

table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate of was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes  the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  and an increase in our tax valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate of was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was a benefit of and was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a tax benefit of million recorded in connection with the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
provision for income taxes increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  benefit from income taxes was million for the year ended december  during  in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  we recorded an income tax benefit of million which was offset by provisions for income taxes primarily related to our alternative minimum tax obligations and income earned in profitable foreign jurisdictions 
as a result of the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million in and  respectively 
based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a twelve quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  during the third quarter of  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration 
as a result  during  we released a total of million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
of such amount  million was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations  million was attributable to stock option exercises  which was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on our balance sheet  and approximately million was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we had a total valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against capital loss carryforwards that are expected to expire unused and also reversed an existing valuation allowance of million related to certain state nol carryforwards 
while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in to remain relatively consistent with  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 
r or any potential tax planning strategies 
our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 
further  our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter  due to items arising from discrete events  including settlements of tax audits and assessments  the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 
because of the availability of the nols discussed above  a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a non cash expense  consequently  the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 

table of contents we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes  which notes were repaid in  an initial public offering of our common stock in october  which generated net proceeds of million  the sale in june of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  which generated net proceeds of million and were repaid or redeemed in full between december and september  the sale in december and january of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which generated net proceeds of million  the public offering of million shares of our common stock in november  which generated net proceeds of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock awards  and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which consisted of corporate debt securities  us treasury and government agency securities  commercial paper  municipal debt securities  and municipal auction rate securities  totaled million 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
we held approximately million in municipal auction rate securities at december  these investments consisted solely of municipal debt securities  none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
in mid february  many of our municipal auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
of the million of auction rate securities we held at december   approximately million had experienced failed auctions through february  the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  which has caused our auction rate securities to fail  prevented us from liquidating certain of our holdings of auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially 
table of contents offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount and higher commissions 
the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for reflects net purchases of short and long term available for sale securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million  including the capitalization of internal use software development costs related to our current and future service offerings

in addition  approximately million of cash  including transaction costs  was used to acquire nine systems in december these purchases and investments were offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and long term securities of million and a decrease of million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflects purchases of property and equipment of million and net purchases of short and long term marketable securities of million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november these investments were offset by sales and maturities of short and long term securities of million  acquisition of million in cash through the acquisition of speedera and a decrease of million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
for  we expect total capital expenditures  a component of cash used in investing activities  to be approximately of total revenues 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan

changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events

if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
we may not  however  be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders

approximately million of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities  of which million are classified as long term marketable securities and million are classified as short term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet at december  the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit 
these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may the remaining million irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  shareholders of acquired companies  joint venture partners and third party licensees of our technology
