item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that harness the immune system to fight cancer 
our portfolio includes active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge sipuleucel t  an active cellular immunotherapy for prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing efforts 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge and other product candidates we may develop 
the 
table of contents majority of our resources continue to be used in support of provenge 
we own worldwide commercialization rights for provenge 
we will not generate revenue from the sale of our potential commercial therapeutic products in the us until provenge or another product candidate we may develop is approved by the us food and drug administration fda 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources and future offerings of equity  debt or other securities 
we anticipate our operating expenses to decrease in in september  we announced plans to submit our biologics license application our bla to the fda for approval to market provenge 
this decision followed a pre bla meeting in which we reviewed safety and efficacy data with the fda from our two completed phase clinical trials for provenge  d and da 
in these discussions the fda agreed that the survival benefit observed in the d study in conjunction with the supportive data obtained from study da and the absence of significant toxicity in both studies was sufficient to serve as the clinical basis of our bla submission for provenge 
provenge was granted fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer patients  which enabled us to submit our bla on a rolling basis 
on august   we submitted the clinical and non clinical sections of our bla and on november   we submitted the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section  completing our submission of our bla to the fda for provenge 
on january   the fda accepted our bla filing and assigned priority review status for provenge 
the fda s cellular  tissue and gene therapies advisory committee the advisory committee review of our bla for the use of provenge in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent also known as hormone refractory prostate cancer was held on march  the advisory committee was unanimous yes  no in its opinion that the submitted data established that provenge is reasonably safe for the intended population and the majority yes  no believed that the submitted data provided substantial evidence of the efficacy of provenge in the intended population 
on may   we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding our bla 
in its letter  the fda requested additional clinical data in support of the efficacy claim contained in the bla  as well as additional information with respect to the cmc section of the bla 
as a result  our board of directors  on may   approved the reduction of company personnel that were focused on the near term commercialization activities of provenge 
this resulted in immediate personnel reductions of approximately of our total workforce  or the elimination of approximately positions 
in a meeting with the fda on may   we received confirmation that the fda will accept either a positive interim or final analysis of survival from our ongoing phase db impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study to support licensure of provenge 
these analyses are event driven  rather than time specific 
we anticipate that interim results will be available from our impact study during the second half of recently  the fda agreed to amend the special protocol assessment for the impact study 
this amendment will enable us to receive final results from the impact study approximately one year earlier than previously anticipated with comparable power for the study 
we anticipate that final results will be available from our impact study during the second half of upon the receipt of positive interim or final analysis of survival  we intend to amend our bla 
the special protocol assessment for the impact study  as amended in september  elevated survival to the primary endpoint 
men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease were eligible for the study 
we completed the target enrollment of patients in the impact study during october critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates  that could have reasonably been used  would have materially changed our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we also recognize license revenue from intellectual property and technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
license fees license fees from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which we have continuing obligations  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products  and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  sfas our research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable upfront fees and milestones become due  whichever occurs first 
the value of acquired in process research and development is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
our research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and related overhead costs 
accounting and reporting for our clinical trial and manufacturing costs require assumptions and estimations to be made that are uncertain at the time and are based upon our experience and assessment of progress 
although we believe that our approach to determining these amounts is reasonable  final billing may be materially different than that which has been historically reflected and may change our reported results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  
table of contents stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we grant restricted stock awards that generally vest over a four year period  however in and we granted restricted stock awards with certain performance conditions to all employees 
in accordance with sfas r  management is required to estimate the probability of achieving each acceleration provision 
compensation expense is recorded based upon our assessment of accomplishing each provision 
we recorded stock based employee compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations in  and of million  million and  respectively 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock based payment awards on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to other conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche 
stock based employee compensation was determined based upon apb no 
in and sfas r in and we determine the grant date fair value of our stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan under sfas r using the bsm option pricing model 
for additional information about stock based compensation and the pro forma effect of recording our share based compensation plans under the fair value method of sfas  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate and there was no material effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing fin we are subject to us federal and state income tax examinations for years after and however  carryforward attributes that were generated prior to may still be adjusted by a taxing authority upon examination if the attributes have been or will be used in a future period 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
during the year ended december   we did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in july  fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
the consensus requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is not permitted 
in accordance with eitf  a change in accounting policy will occur whereby nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services will be deferred and recognized as the services are rendered 
under existing policy such payments are charged to research and development expense as paid 
this accounting policy change may impact our financial condition and the results of operations in the future 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  in september the new standard provides guidance on the use of fair value measurements 
it also prescribes expanded disclosures about fair value measurements contained in the financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which the effective date has been deferred until periods beginning after november  
table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the two new fair value standards  which are not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the pronouncements  including any new disclosures  are effective for us as of the first quarter of in december  the fasb ratified the final consensuses in eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which requires certain income statement presentation of transactions with third parties and of payments between parties to the collaborative arrangement  along with disclosure about the nature and purpose of the arrangement

results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue was  in   in and  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to revenue related to an intellectual property option purchase agreement entered into in and exercised in our revenue in and also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to two license agreements 
wilex on february   we entered into an option purchase agreement with wilex ag wilex for our intellectual property in small molecule inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator u pa 
on march   wilex exercised its option pursuant to the terms and conditions of the option agreement in exchange for payment to us of  the sale of this technology is a perpetual exclusive arrangement where we have assigned our entire right  title and interest in the intellectual property to wilex 
furthermore  upon exercising its option  wilex is obligated to make additional milestone payments to us upon the occurrence of future events  which includes initiation of the first clinical phase ii and phase iii studies resulting from a product developed from the intellectual property and upon the first sale of this product after an approval from the fda 
genentech under our collaboration agreement with genentech  inc for the preclinical research  clinical development and commercialization of potential products derived from trp p  genentech continues to be primarily responsible for the monoclonal antibody products program and has certain rights with respect to other products in our agreement with them 
genentech s option to participate in the small molecule program has expired 
consequently  we own worldwide rights to the small molecule program 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term of ten years  which represents an estimate of our continuing obligations under this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase compared with was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing costs of million  increased facility related costs of million associated with our morris plains  new jersey manufacturing facility the facility and increased lab expenses of  offset by decreased outside service costs of million and decreased clinical development costs of million

indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  rent  restructuring charges  stock based compensation  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand

the nols and r d credits expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based employee compensation expense in and included the impact of the adoption of sfas r on january  stock based employee compensation expense in was determined using apb no 
and consisted of the amortization of deferred stock based employee compensation resulting from unvested stock options assumed in our merger with corvas international  inc  modifications to stock options  grant of restricted stock awards and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange for services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy  which specifies credit quality standards  limits the credit exposure of any single issuer and defines allowable investments 
no auction rate or mortgage back securities are permitted to be held 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short term and long term investments at december   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment we proactively monitor and manage our portfolio 
if necessary we believe we are able to liquidate our investments without significant loss within the next year 
we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government and major corporate guarantees of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded values 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our debt financings by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
