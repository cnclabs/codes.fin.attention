lazard operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for lazard s management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can lazard assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see the section entitled risk factors in this form k 
net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory global m a activity for the year ended december  increased versus the corresponding prior year for both global and trans atlantic completed transactions and announced transactions  as evidenced by the following industry statistics regarding the volume of transactions year ended december  incr decr in billions completed m a transactions global trans atlantic announced m a transactions global trans atlantic source thomson financial as of january  while overall m a industry statistics regarding the volume of announced transactions remained strong in  the industry outlook for is somewhat uncertain 
we believe that we are well positioned  due to the varied experience of our teams  the investments we have made in our business  and the diversity of our products  even in the current environment 
activity in financial restructuring in continued at low levels  with the amount of corporate debt defaults  according to moody s investors service  inc  at billion  down from the billion recorded in and the lowest level since despite the low level of corporate defaults experienced in  results in our financial restructuring practice reflected not only global expertise in bankruptcy assignments  but also from advising companies on matters relating to debt and financing restructuring and other complex on and off balance sheet assignments 
although default rates were at record low levels in  moody s is expecting increases in default rates in as a result of weaker macroeconomic fundamentals and a modest worsening in the ratings mix of moody s speculative grade issuers 

table of contents asset management as shown in the table below  there were generally modest increases in global market indices at december  as compared to such indices at december   with the markets experiencing significant volatility in the second half of  principally as a result of mixed corporate earnings and developments in the credit markets

financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue is earned from the successful completion of mergers  acquisitions  restructurings  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main driver of financial advisory net revenue is overall m a  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction 
lazard s financial advisory segment also earns revenue from public and private securities offerings in the form of referral fees for referring to lfcm holdings opportunities for underwriting and distribution of securities 
the referral fees received from lfcm holdings is generally half of the revenue recorded by lfcm holdings in respect of such activities 
lazard s asset management segment principally includes lazard asset management llc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as lam  lazard freres gestion sas lfg and fonds partenaires gestion fpg 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to institutional and private clients 
the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level of aum  which is influenced in large part by lazard s investment performance and by lazard s ability to successfully attract and retain assets  as well as the broader performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
in addition  as lazard s aum include significant assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to us currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity products  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
the company also earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including alternative investment funds such as hedge funds  private equity funds and traditional products 
incentive fees are 
table of contents calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
incentive fees on private equity funds also may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits from investments exceed a specified threshold 
these incentive fees are paid at the end of the measurement period 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carry forward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
the company records incentive fees at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the performance fee measurement period is generally an annual period  unless an account terminates during the year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
corporate net revenue consists primarily of net interest income  including amounts earned at lfb  and investment income earned on debt securities at lfb  lam managed equity funds and principal investments in equities and alternative investment funds managed by lazard alternative investments holdings llc lai 
interest expense related to the financing transactions associated with the equity public offering is included in corporate net revenue 
corporate net revenue can fluctuate due to fair value adjustments  changes in interest rates and in interest rate and credit spreads and changes in the levels of cash  investments and indebtedness 
although corporate net revenue during the year ended december  represented of lazard s net revenue  total assets in corporate represented of lazard s consolidated total assets as of december   principally attributable to assets associated with lfb  and  to a lesser extent  investments in lam managed funds  other securities and cash 
lazard expects to experience significant fluctuations in net revenue and operating income during the course of any given year 
these fluctuations arise because a significant portion of financial advisory net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  financial restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
asset management net revenue is also subject to periodic fluctuations 
asset management fees are generally based on aum measured as of the end of a quarter or month  and an increase or reduction in aum at such dates  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  net client asset flows or otherwise  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
in addition  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not recorded until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
for most of our funds that determination is made at year end  and therefore such incentive fees are recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for employees and managing directors 
as a limited liability company  prior to the equity public offering on may  payments for services rendered by the majority of lazard s managing directors were accounted for as distributions of members capital 
in addition  commencing january  and through may   payments for services rendered by managing directors and employee members of lam were accounted for as minority interest in net income 
see minority interest 
for periods subsequent to may   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors  including the managing directors and employee members of lam and distributions to profit participation members  in compensation and benefits expense 
as a result  lazard s compensation and benefits expense and operating income for the years ended december  and includes all such payments  while compensation and benefits expense and operating income for the year ended december  did not include those payments for services rendered by lazard s managing directors prior to the equity public offering on may  if the portion of distributions to managing directors and lam members was accounted for as compensation  total compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher 

table of contents our policy is that our compensation and benefits expense will not exceed of operating revenue each year  including compensation and benefits payable to our managing directors and amortization of restricted stock unit awards rsus under our equity incentive plan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  and  our compensation expense to operating revenue ratio was  and  respectively with the percentage for giving effect to the pre equity public offering portion of distributions to members which represent payment for services rendered and our minority interest in net income related to lam being accounted for as compensation and benefits expense 
we achieved these ratios while continuing to maintain compensation packages for our managing directors that we believe are competitive in the market place 
while we have implemented such steps that we believe will maintain our ongoing compensation expense to operating revenue ratio to the target level of  there can be no guarantee that this will continue to be achieved or that our policy will not change in the future 
increased competition for senior professionals  changes in the financial markets generally or other factors could prevent us from sustaining this objective 
the balance of lazard s operating expenses are referred to below as non compensation expense  which includes costs for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourced services  provision pursuant to a tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings and other expenses 
effective in  lazard implemented a revised categorization of non compensation expenses to better reflect the manner in which we manage and review expenses 
as such  certain expense categories were i eliminated and reclassified to other categories  ii added to enhance clarity to those expenses which may  for example  fluctuate consistent with aum  or iii renamed and combined to more effectively capture related expenses previously included in other categories 
operating expenses also include the costs lazard incurred as a result of the equity public offering after may  lazard has incurred additional expenses for  among other things  directors fees  sec reporting and compliance  insurance  investor relations  legal  accounting and other costs associated with being a public company 
provision for income taxes lazard group primarily operates in the us as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  lazard group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to us federal income taxes because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of the individual partners 
outside the us  lazard group operates principally through corporations and is subject to local income taxes 
income taxes shown on lazard s consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the equity public offering on may  are attributable to taxes incurred in non us entities and to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt attributable to lazard s operations apportioned to new york city 
following the equity public offering  lazard group is continuing to operate in the us as a limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and remains subject to local income taxes outside the us and to ubt 
in addition  lazard ltd s corporate subsidiaries are subject to additional income taxes  which taxes are reflected in its consolidated statements of income 
minority interest minority interest consists of a number of components 
as described below  amounts recorded as minority interest for periods prior to the equity public offering on may  are not comparable to amounts recorded as minority interest for periods commencing may  commencing may   the company records a charge to minority interest in net income relating to laz md holdings ownership interest in lazard group  which approximated  and at december   and  respectively  with such expense amounting to million million and million for the years ended december  and and for the period may  through december   respectively 

table of contents also included in minority interest in our consolidated financial statements are minority interests in various lam related general partnerships held directly by certain of our lam managing directors 
in  certain members of lazard group who provided services to lam contributed capital to lam and ceased being members of lazard group 
in connection with this contribution  lam managing directors and other key lam employees were granted equity units in lam 
these capital interests were included in minority interest on lazard group s consolidated statements of financial condition and through may   payments for services rendered by these individuals were accounted for as minority interest in net income in lazard group s consolidated statements of income 
as a result of the equity public offering  and as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commencing may  the company no longer recognizes payments for services rendered by the managing directors and employee members of lam as charges to minority interest  with such charges now included in compensation and benefits expense 
the lam equity units entitle holders to payments in connection with selected fundamental transactions affecting lazard group or lam  including a dissolution or sale of all  or substantially all  of the assets of lazard group or lam  a merger of  or sale of  all of the interests in lam whereby lazard group ceases to own a majority of lam or have the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of lam  or a non ordinary course sale of assets by lam that exceeds million in value 
as a general matter  in connection with a fundamental transaction that triggers the lam equity units  following the completion of such transactions the holders of the lam equity units would be entitled in the aggregate  as of both december  and  to approximately of the net proceeds or imputed valuation of lam in such transaction after deductions for payment of creditors of lam and the return of lam capital 
as of december   and lam s capital for these purposes totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
during  approximately million of such capital was repaid to the managing directors and employee members of lam  with the remainder now entirely owned by lazard group 
these lam equity units are not entitled to share in the operating results of lam 
a separate class of interests in lam  which we refer to as lam profit units  is entitled to the ordinary profit and losses of lam  all of which are owned by lazard group 
accordingly  in the absence of a fundamental transaction that triggers the lam equity units  all of lam s net income is allocable to lazard group 
we have no current intention to cause or otherwise trigger a fundamental transaction that would give rise to payment obligations to the holders of interests in lam 
the board of directors of lam  a majority of which is appointed by lazard group  may  in its discretion  grant lam equity interests that include profit rights to managing directors of  and other persons providing services to  lam  as a portion of their ongoing compensation 
if granted  these equity interests would be subject to specified vesting conditions 
no such lam equity interests have been granted as of december  nor is there any present intention to do so 
commencing january   lazard group recorded minority interest to reflect its strategic alliance with banca intesa spa intesa  under which intesa was a partner in lazard group s business interests in italy 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on may  lazard group  lazard co 
srl lazard italy  an indirect subsidiary of lazard group  and intesa completed the termination of the strategic alliance 
as a result of the termination  lazard group now owns of lazard italy  and therefore no longer records minority interest with respect to this alliance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the components of the company s minority interest 
discontinued operations as described above  in connection with the separation lazard group transferred the capital markets and other segment to lfcm holdings as of may  capital markets and other net revenue largely consisted of primary revenue earned from underwriting fees from securities offerings and secondary revenue earned in the 
table of contents form of commissions and trading profits from principal transactions in lazard group s equity  fixed income and convertibles businesses and underwriting and other fee revenue from corporate broking in the uk lazard group also earned fund management fees and  if applicable  carried interest incentive fees related to alternative investments and private equity funds managed as part of this former segment 
such carried interest incentive fees were earned if profits from alternative investments and private equity investments exceeded a specified threshold 
in addition  this former segment generated investment income and net interest income principally from investments  cash balances and securities financing transactions 
consolidated results of operations lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of our non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members or stockholders equity 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of income 
as described above  operating results for the period prior to the equity public offering on may  are not comparable to operating results subsequent to that date

table of contents net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and financial restructuring generally are correlated to the volume of completed industry wide mergers and acquisitions activity and restructurings occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  material variances in the level of mergers and acquisitions activity in a particular geography where lazard has significant market share or the number of its advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions can cause its results to diverge from industry wide activity 
certain lazard client statistics and global industry statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients total with fees greater than million percentage of total financial advisory revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed greater than billion b a there were no individual clients that constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source thomson financial as of january  the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms 
the offices that generate financial advisory net revenue are located in the united states  europe principally in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world principally in australia  which  for the period  includes the impact of the acquisition of cwc 
year ended december  united states europe rest of world total the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on both mergers and acquisitions and financial restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professional staff with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings 
while lazard measures revenue by practice area  lazard does not separately measure the separate costs or profitability of mergers and acquisitions services as compared to financial restructuring services 
accordingly  lazard measures performance in its financial advisory segment based on overall segment net revenue and operating income margins 
financial advisory results of operations year ended december  versus december  in  financial advisory net revenue increased million  or  as compared to during m a revenue increased million  or  financial restructuring revenue increased million  or  and corporate finance and other net revenue increased million  or 
the increase in m a revenue in was due primarily to organic growth  reflecting an increase in both the number of clients and average fee per transaction for those transactions with fees in excess of million and

financial restructuring revenue is derived from various activities including bankruptcy assignments  global debt and financing restructurings and advice on complex on and off balance sheet assignments  such as retiree health care obligations 
the increase in revenue was the result of several large assignments during including  eurotunnel  calpine s unsecured creditors committee  new century financial corporation  tower automotive and the uaw in connection with its contract discussions with gm  ford and chrysler over retiree health care obligations and in connection with delphi s bankruptcy

cash flows the company s cash flows are generated from operating  financing  and investment activities 
with respect to operating activities  cash flow is influenced by the timing of the receipt of fee income  distributions to shareholders and payment of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees 
m a and asset management fees are generally collected within days of billing  while restructuring fee collections may extend beyond days  particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court ordered holdbacks 
fees from our private fund advisory activities are generally collected over a four year period from billing and typically include an interest component 
lazard traditionally pays a substantial portion of incentive compensation during the first four months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results

the year ended december  also includes the net proceeds from the sale of  shares of lazard class a common stock the primary offering 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities  financing agreements and equity offerings 
operating activities net revenue  operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between quarters 
in the case of financial advisory  fee receipts are principally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
in the case of asset management  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not earned until the end of the applicable measurement period  which is generally the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year with the respective receivable collected in the first quarter of the following year 
liquidity is significantly impacted by incentive compensation payments that are made during the first four months of the year 
as a consequence  cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year 
we also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors  which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency  ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted  that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members equity stockholders equity deficiency

we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash levels  credit lines  principal investment commitments  interest and principal payments on debt  capital expenditures and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements 
we maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated 
table of contents liquidity requirements 
as of december   lazard had approximately million in unused lines of credit available to it  including million of unused lines of credit available to lfb 
lazard s annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations 
we believe that our cash flows from operating activities  including use of our credit lines as needed  should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next months and beyond 
as noted above  we intend to maintain lines of credit that can be utilized should the need arise 
these credit lines include a million senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in may  as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
the senior revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type which  among other things  limit the ability of the borrower to incur debt  grant liens  pay dividends  enter into mergers or to sell all or substantially all of its assets and contains financial covenants that must be maintained 
we may  to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements  use other financing sources in addition to any new credit facilities 
in addition  the indenture and supplemental indentures relating to lazard group s senior notes contain certain covenants  events of default and other customary provisions 
financing agreements over the past several years  lazard has entered into several financing agreements designed to strengthen both its capital base and liquidity  the most significant of which are described below

effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect lazard expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see risk factors risks related to our business difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
lazard s clients generally enter into agreements with lazard that vary in duration depending on the nature of the service provided 
lazard typically bills clients for the full amounts due under the applicable agreements on or after the dates on which the specified service has been provided 
generally  payments are collected within days of billing or over longer periods of time with respect to billings related to restructurings and our private fund advisory activities 
the company also earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including alternative investment funds such as hedge funds  private equity funds and traditional products 
incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
incentive fees on private equity funds also may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits from investments exceed a specified threshold 
these incentive fees are paid at the end of the measurement period 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carry forward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
the company records incentive fees at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the performance fee measurement period is generally an annual period  unless an account terminates during the year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
lazard assesses whether collection is probable based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and an assessment of the client s current creditworthiness 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
in rare cases  an allowance for doubtful accounts may be established  for example  if a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  lazard is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process requires lazard to estimate its actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains on investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within lazard s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in addition  as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
on january  discussed below  a higher standard must be met before tax benefits can be recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning in significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million  with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million due to the uncertainty of realizing the 
table of contents benefits of the book versus tax basis differences and certain net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  when necessary  valuation allowances are established 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the company in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or lazard adjusts these estimates in future periods  lazard may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact lazard s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on january   the company adopted fin no 
which clarifies the more likely than not criteria included in fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  that must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also requires the recognition of a liability for differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
management applies the more likely than not criteria included in fin no 
when estimating its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements herein regarding the adoption of fin no 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect lazard s overall effective tax rate 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
furthermore  lazard s interpretation of complex tax laws may impact its measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
valuation of investments investments consist principally of debt securities  equities  investments in alternative asset management funds and other private equity investments 
these investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition  with any increases or decreases in fair value reflected in earnings  to the extent held by our broker dealer subsidiaries or designated as trading securities under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 within our non broker dealer subsidiaries  and in accumulated other comprehensive income  to the extent designated as available for sale securities under sfas no 
until such time they are realized and reclassified to earnings 
gains and losses on investment positions held  which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments  are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
equities principally represent the company s investments in marketable equity securities either held directly or indirectly through asset management funds 
equities are either designated as trading securities under sfas no 
or accounted for pursuant to broker dealer accounting guidelines depending upon the entity in which such equities are held 
interests in lam alternative asset management funds principally represent general partnership interests in lam managed hedge funds 
the fair value of such interests reflects the pro rata value of the ownership of the underlying securities in the funds  the fair market value of which is determined through quoted market values of the underlying securities as provided by external pricing sources 
minority interests in lam alternative asset management funds represent general partnership interests held directly by certain of our lam managing directors or employees of the company but controlled and consolidated by lazard 
the associated minority interest amounting to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  is included in minority interest on the consolidated statements of financial condition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents private equity investments  which represent approximately and of total assets at december  and  respectively  are primarily comprised of investments in private equity funds and direct private equity interests that are valued  in the absence of observable market prices  initially at cost  which is subsequently adjusted for additional capital raising transactions such as the issuance of new member interests or through a sale of existing equity to a third party or other events that are indicative of fair value 
in the absence of third party transactions  the carrying value of such investments may be adjusted if it is determined that the expected realizable value of the investment differs from the carrying value 
in reaching that determination  consideration is given to many factors including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the investee  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features  liquidation preferences or restrictions 
with respect to the majority of private equity investments  we rely on the third party fund managers for estimates of such fair values 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding investments 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  lazard makes estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using various valuation techniques 
lazard uses its best judgment and information available to it at the time to perform this review 
because lazard s assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of vies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and all other entities in which it has a controlling interest 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
lazard is required to consolidate a voting interest entity that it maintains an ownership interest in if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such entity 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
if lazard has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests  in a vie and it will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both  it is required to consolidate such entity 
lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard was determined to be the primary beneficiary were consolidated in accordance with fin r 
those vies included company sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with lazard s compensation plans 
in connection with the separation  lazard group transferred its general partnership interests in those vies to a subsidiary of lfcm holdings 
lazard group has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary with respect to those vies and  as a result  the company no longer consolidates such vies
