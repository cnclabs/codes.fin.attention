item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview and developments we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are concentrated in two rocky mountain basins 
our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
using this strategy  we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves  as well as conventional and unconventional prospects  that we have the opportunity to explore  drill and develop 
our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by the success of our exploration and land leasing activity  the resulting production and reserves  oil and natural gas commodity prices  and the costs related to operating our properties 
in  we made significant progress in our exploration activities related to our prospective land positions with exploratory drilling and by obtaining additional geological and geophysical data 
overall  we invested capital of million in our oil and gas operations including spent on drilling  completion and related infrastructure and million spent on land leasing and geological and geophysical data 
although we have not obtained significant production with these expenditures  this investment has provided us with a platform to build on as we further develop our exploration plays 
our understanding of the natural gas in place in the baxter formation of the vermillion basin and the completion requirements to get that gas has improved with each well we have drilled 
we drilled and completed four deep gas wells 
this includes the horseshoe basin well where we expanded the over pressured  gas bearing area by drilling six miles from the nearest existing production 
we expect that we will connect this well to gathering facilities in the summer of  which we believe will add significant cash inflows 
we completed the acquisition and are currently analyzing the d seismic study of a square mile area on our land holdings in the northern portion of our acreage in the vermillion basin 
early in  we announced the signing of an exploration agreement with devon energy production company  lp  which  among other things  allows devon to earn ownership in our vermillion properties through drilling three exploratory wells at their sole cost 
with this agreement  development will continue to move ahead in this play and our capital requirements will be limited 
we expect that the completed d seismic studies acquired in will prove useful well into the future as we seek to expand our production base through additional drilling 
our acreage position acquired in and early in the bakken play of dunn county  north dakota will  we believe  prove to be one of the most exciting developments onshore north america 
we continued to expand our acreage position in dunn county  north dakota  where we will target the bakken shale 
pending regulatory approvals  we expect to have leased over  net acres in this play bordered by producing wells 
in the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with another independent exploration and production company to jointly lease and develop a block of acreage in this play 
this agreement provides for shared participation in future drilling and leasing activities in the play 
subject to permitting by the bureau of land management and the bureau of indian affairs  we expect to begin drilling operations early in in the williston basin of north dakota and montana  we completed two oil wells in and have recently completed an square mile d seismic program 
we expect the results of this d seismic will lead to additional drilling opportunities in with contractual agreements in place with industry leaders to partner in the development of the vermillion basin and certain acreage in the dunn county bakken play  we believe we have excellent exposure to the potential of these developments without a large capital requirement 
as of december   we had estimated proved reserves of billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas and thousand barrels mbbls of oil with a present value discounted at of million 
our reserves are proved developed and are comprised of natural gas and crude oil on an energy equivalent basis 
our december   natural gas reserves reflect a downward revision of the december   reserves of bcf  primarily from the revision of reserves associated with the underperformance of our vermillion basin exploratory wells 
in december  we had recently completed the north trail and based on early results and geological studies  the well was estimated to have bcf of reserves 
subsequently  in  due to various mechanical problems  this well s production did not meet anticipated flow rates 
as a result  in the reserve study  this well does not contribute significantly 
offsetting this downward revision  we had discoveries and extensions during of bcf of natural gas and mbbls of oil primarily related to the horseshoe basin well 
we had gas sales in of mcf per day and crude oil sales of barrels per day 
this was an increase of and over the volumes sold in revenues from oil and gas sales increased to million in with of the change due to the increase in commodity prices and of the change due to increased sales volumes 
lease operating expenses increased to  overall  total production expenses increased to million  primarily due to increased production taxes related to the increased revenues 
our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
during recent years  including and into  we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices 
we believe that spot market prices reflect worldwide concerns about producers ability to ensure sufficient supply to meet increasing demand amid a host of uncertainties caused by political instability  a weak us dollar  and crude oil refining and natural gas infrastructure constraint 
prices we have received have varied widely depending on commodity and location of salespoints 
in  we experienced record crude oil prices while in wyoming we elected to shut in gas production because of extremely low natural gas prices 
overall  the average crude oil price we received for the year was per barrel versus per barrel in  while our average gas price received was per mcf compared to per mcf in in  our financial position and results of operations were affected significantly by an asset impairment related to the carrying value of our developed properties 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million related to our oil and gas drilling operations and related infrastructure 
except for wells currently in progress  these expenditures increased the company s full cost pool  but did not add proportionately to our proved reserves present value calculated under the current sec guidelines 
the value of kodiak s proved reserves as calculated periodically throughout the year did not exceed the costs included in the full cost pool 
consequently the company recorded a cumulative asset impairment of million during outlook in  we expect to continue to focus on the leasing and permitting related to the dunn county  north dakota bakken prospect 
we expect that this will culminate in a multiple well drilling program beginning in the summer of with the acreage position gained in and early  we expect that most of our capital budget will be focused on the drilling of this project 
in the vermillion basin  with the gains in knowledge as a result of our exploratory efforts in and  and a partner with excellent unconventional gas development expertise  we expect to see significant progress in the development of this play 
we believe that oil and gas prices will remain volatile during as a result of increases in the prices of domestic oil and natural gas over the past several years  and the corresponding increased demand for oil field services  shortages have developed  and we have seen an escalation in rig rates  field service costs  material prices and all costs associated with drilling  completing and operating wells 
if oil and natural gas prices remain high relative to historical levels  we anticipate that the recent trends toward increasing costs and equipment and personnel shortages will continue 
while we have identified prospects to drill  our ability to grow could be adversely affected by these shortages and price increases 
we plan to make capital expenditures of approximately million for we will continuously evaluate our capital expenditures budget and make adjustments from time to time as our results of operations and other factors dictate 
of the million  we have allocated million to our operations in the vermillion basin primarily related to geophysical studies and land leasing 
this assumes no contribution to the costs of drilling up to three gross wells which will be paid for by devon as part of the devon agreement 
we have estimated that we will incur an additional million of capital expenditures in the exploration of the bakken play in north dakota and for workovers of existing bakken wells to the west of our dunn county acreage position 
depending on the timing of the receipt of permits from regulatory agencies  rig availability and the success of each well  we expect to drill three to four gross wells in this area in in addition to this million budget  we have other prospects that are in the early stages of exploration 
further spending on these prospects is contingent on the success of the core projects described above 
to execute the plan  we have many challenges 
our working capital of million as of december   will not be sufficient to completely support all of our potential exploration opportunities in although we expect that cash flow from operations will increase with the success of the core projects  currently these funds provide only a limited amount of additional working capital 
to further develop these projects and fund the contingent prospects  we will need to obtain alternative sources of capital 
we anticipate that we will seek to obtain additional funding  either by means of debt or equity financings or by entering into additional joint venture agreements with other companies  the availability of which there can be no assurance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically financed our operations  property acquisitions and capital investments from the proceeds of private offerings of our equity securities and  more recently to a limited extent  from cash generated from operations 
we do not currently generate sustaining cash flow from our oil and gas operations  although our future depends on our ability to generate oil and natural gas operating cash flow 
as of december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december   and no long term debt 
during the fiscal year ended december   our additions to oil and natural gas properties totaled million including accrued expenditures 
due to our active oil and natural gas activities  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial working capital requirements 
as a result of our agreement with devon  we expect to maintain a high level of activity in the vermillion basin  while not being responsible for significant capital expenditures 
if we continue to build on our most recent success in this play  we would anticipate additional capital requirements by late and into by reducing the capital requirements of the continuing vermillion basin exploration  we are able to allocate our existing capital to the north dakota bakken play 
through an exploration agreement with a joint venture partner in this play  we have limited our initial capital exposure to an approximate working interest in each of the early wells 
as a result  we adopted a preliminary budget for capital expenditures in of million 
additional anticipated expenditures will be predicated upon the results of our drilling in these core areas 
we intend to fund these capital expenditures  other commitments and working capital requirements with existing capital  expected cash flow from operations  anticipated joint venture arrangements  and finally the potential funds raised from the sale of our equity 
we do not expect to significantly fund our oil and gas operations with debt unless and until we generate sufficient cash flow from oil and natural gas operations to service the debt 
our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may have to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue our drilling or exploration program  seek to enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties  or seek to sell one or more of our properties 
operating results fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of increased natural gas sales volumes more than offset price declines between the periods 
natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas declined by to per mcf 
the increase in gas production volumes is due to an increase in the number of operating gas wells  from six wells in to fourteen in the increased sales were partially offset by reduced volumes due to shutting in wells during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of low natural gas prices received for our vermillion basin production 
oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for in  we benefitted from both increased oil sales volumes and higher realized oil prices 
oil sales volumes were  barrels for compared to  barrels for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased by to per barrel for the year ended december   from for the same period in the increase in oil sales volumes are a result of having a full year s production for wells drilled during as well as two additional wells drilled and completed in interest income 
interest income increased by  to  in from  for the same period in the increase was due to the investment of funds received from our december sale of shares of our common stock 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase is partially due to an increase in lease operating expense reflecting our growing production base and number of producing wells 
also  severance taxes increased due to increased revenues from growing sales volumes and higher prices and the expiration of incentive production taxes 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase reflects our growing depletable and depreciable asset base and our production base 
overall the rate of dda expense has increased from per barrel of oil equivalent to per boe 
this increase was impacted by the addition of expenditures related to our exploration and development activities to our depletable basis  or full cost pool  without a proportionate increase in proved reserves 
additionally  because of changes in development plans and the drilling of unproductive wells  certain leasehold costs were impaired which increased the full cost pool 
asset impairment 
as of march   based on current oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf  the company s full cost pool exceeded the present value of the company s estimated future net revenue discounted at 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended march  based on the company s evaluation of oil and gas reserves at september   using weighted average realized oil and gas prices of per barrel of crude oil and per mcf of natural gas  the company s full cost pool again exceeded the ceiling limitation by approximately million and an impairment expense was recorded for this amount during the quarter ended september  the year to date impairment of  is primarily the result of the company s inability to establish production and qualified reserves in its deep vermillion basin project  uneconomic natural gas prices in wyoming  and the impairment of certain undeveloped properties in wyoming and north dakota 
as with many resource plays in the early stages of development  significant expenditures have been and will continue to be required to understand the parameters of the deep vermillion basin play 
as of december   we have drilled four exploratory wells in the baxter  frontier  and dakota formations to better understand the resource potential 
in the second half of  we focused on acquiring additional geologic and geophysical data from these wells and the acquisition and interpretation of an extensive seismic study over the northern portion of our acreage 
while we are optimistic about the long term potential of this prospect we have not established significant proved reserves for the deep vermillion basin 
as a result  the value of the development to date calculated under sec guidelines does not offset the cost of the wells and related acreage in the full cost pool 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in included in the general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended december  is a stock based compensation charge of  for options issued to officers  directors and employees compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   also reflects an increase in our level of activity and an increase in the number of employees and related salary and payroll expense 
as of december   we had fifteen full time employees and three contract consultants  as compared to full time employees at december  salary and related expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in in  we also incurred additional costs of  related to outside consulting services and additional audit requirements as a result of the adoption of section of sarbanes oxley 
gain on currency exchange 
in  we benefited from an increase in the value of our canadian dollars with a  gain on currency exchange as compared to a loss in of  our canadian dollar balance has largely been converted to us dollars as of year end so we do not expect similar gains in the future 
net loss 
our net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the year ended december   from a net loss of  for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of  was the primary cause of the increase 
in addition  the increases in our oil and natural gas production revenues  interest income and gain on currency exchange were more than offset by increases in oil and natural gas production expense  depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability expenses and general and administrative expenses 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this increase is the primarily the result of increased oil and gas revenues only partially offset by increased production expenses and general and administrative expenses

for the year ended december  change oil and gas production revenues   interest revenue    total revenue    oil and gas production expense    general and administrative expense excluding stock compensation adjusted ebitda    fiscal year ended december   compared to fiscal year ended december  natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas and natural gas liquid sales revenues increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period of increased natural gas sales volumes more than offset price declines between the periods 
natural gas and natural gas liquid production volumes were  mcf and  mcf  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas declined by to per mcf for the fiscal year ended december   from per mcf for the same period of the increase in gas production volumes is due to an increase in the number of producing gas wells  from one well at december   to six at december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period of oil sales volumes and realized oil prices increased during the period 
oil sales volumes were  barrels for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  barrels for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased by to per barrel for the fiscal year ended december   from for the same period in the increase in oil sales volumes is due to an increase in the number of operating wells  from one well at december   to seven at december  interest income 
interest income increased by  to  in for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase was due to the investment of funds received from our march and december sale of shares of our common stock 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase is partially due to paying severance taxes on production from exploratory wells in montana during the last part of  whereas these same wells were exempt from state severance taxes in the increase also reflects our growing production base and number of producing wells 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase reflects our growing depletable and depreciable asset base and our production base 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in included in the general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
r is a stock based compensation charge of  for options issued to officers  directors and employees compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   also reflects an increase in our level of activity and an increase in the number of employees and related salary and payroll expense 
during the fiscal year ended december   we had twelve full time employees and two part time contract consultants  an increase of six from the same period in salary and payroll expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in during the fiscal year ended december  we paid bonuses totaling  to employees and management  compared to  during the same period in in  we also incurred additional legal expenses and costs related to outside accounting services  as a result of our filings with the securities and exchange commission  costs associated with our application for trading on the amex  and costs incurred in connection with our reporting to shareholders 
we commenced trading on the amex on june  loss on currency exchange 
loss on currency exchange decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december  from  for the same period in we received a portion of the proceeds from our march private placement of common shares in canadian dollars 
net loss 
our net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december  from a net loss of  for the same period of as more fully described above  the increases in our oil and natural gas production revenues  interest income and gain on currency exchange were more than offset by increases in oil and natural gas production expense  depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability expenses and general and administrative expenses 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this increase is the primarily the result of increased oil and gas revenues only partially offset by increased production expenses and general and administrative expenses 
for further discussion of this non gaap measure and a reconciliation of this measure to net income  see non gaap financial measure in item of this k 
for the year ended december  change oil and gas production revenues    interest revenue    total revenue    oil and gas production expense    general and administrative expense excluding stock compensation adjusted ebitda    financial instruments and other instruments as at december   we had cash  accounts payable and accrued liabilities which are carried at approximate fair value because of the short maturity date of those instruments 
our management believes that we are not exposed to significant interest  currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments 
research and development as an exploration stage natural resource company  we do not normally engage in research and there were no development activities  or research and development expenditures made in the last three fiscal years 
trend information our industry has experienced a significant increase in the cost of drilling rigs and related oil field services 
drilling rigs have been difficult to contract and we cannot be assured that we can secure third party contracts 
commodity prices are at or near all time levels and we cannot be assured that they will continue at these levels 
it is difficult to assure that we can retain qualified employees during a competitive period in the industry 
some or all of these situations are likely to have a material effect upon our net sales or revenues  income from continuing operations  profitability  liquidity or capital resources  or cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table lists as of december   information with respect to our known contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term obligations office facilities   we have not included asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and natural gas reserves we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the periodic calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each period to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of that period 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that periodic reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and at other such times throughout the year that we deem appropriate 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all interim periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 
impairment of long lived assets we record our property and equipment at cost 
the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
we review these properties periodically for possible impairment 
we provide an impairment allowance on unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our proved properties and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recording of impairment may be appropriate 
our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenue from a property  using escalated pricing  with the related net capitalized costs of the property at the end of the applicable period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property  the cost of the property is added to the full cost pool 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we use our knowledge of our properties  their historical performance  the anticipated effect of weather conditions during the month of production  nymex and local spot market prices and other factors as the basis for these estimates 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
our estimated asset retirement obligations are reflected in our depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement requires us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate stock based compensation 
oil and natural gas properties full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 
capitalized costs  together with the costs of production equipment  are depleted and amortized on the unit of production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
for this purpose  we convert our petroleum products and reserves to a common unit of measure 
costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are initially excluded from depletion calculations 
these unevaluated properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to the full cost pool and becomes subject to depletion calculations 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the sale would alter the rate of depletion by more than 
royalties paid  net of any tax credits  received are netted against oil and natural gas sales 
in applying the full cost method  we perform a ceiling test on properties that restricts the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion from exceeding an amount equal to the estimated undiscounted value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimated future revenues are based on sales prices achievable under existing contracts and posted average reference prices in effect at the end of the applicable period  and current costs  and after deducting estimated future general and administrative expenses  production related expenses  financing costs  future site restoration costs and income taxes 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  we would recognize an impairment 
foreign currency fluctuations monetary items denominated in a foreign currency  other than us dollars  are converted into us dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date 
foreign currency denomination revenue and expense items are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date 
gains or losses arising from the translations are included in operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our primary market risk consists of market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties will be impacted by oil and natural gas prices 
a per mcf change in the market price of natural gas would result in a change of approximately  in our gross gas production revenue for the fiscal year ended december  a per barrel change in the market price of oil would result in a change of approximately  in our gross oil production revenue for the fiscal year ended december  the impact on any potential sale of property cannot be readily determined 
interest rate risk we currently maintain some of our available cash in redeemable short term investments  classified as cash equivalents  and our reported interest income from these short term investments could be adversely affected by any material changes in us dollar interest rates 
a change in the interest rate would result in a change of approximately  in our interest income for the fiscal year ended december  if all of our cash were invested in interest bearing notes
