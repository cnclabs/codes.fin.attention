item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our selected five year financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement for forward looking information certain information set forth in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to potential acquisitions and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we may make additional forward looking statements from time to time 
all forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by us or on our behalf  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales returns and rebates sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income as all options granted under those stock based employee compensation plans had exercise prices equal to the market values of the underlying common shares on the dates of grant 
the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historic and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  years to maturity based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value

results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales consolidated sales for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease to decreased sales of engineered products segment of  to decreased infection control segment sales of  to decreased sales from our extended care products segment of  partially offset by increased sales of disposable protective apparel products of  sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the year ended december  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the increase is primarily related to increased sales to cleanroom and industrial distributors  partially offset by lower sales to our largest distributor 
although sales only increased by or million in  sales for this segment were up or million through the first nine months of year over year growth was significantly impacted by weak shipments in the fourth quarter of to our largest distributor as well as a record quarter in the fourth quarter of although our shipments to this distributor were weak in the fourth quarter  their shipments to their end users were in line with their quarterly average sales 
in september  we announced the signing of a new distribution contract with our largest distributor in which they retained the exclusive right to sell our private label critical cover products  but have also allowed us the right to sell alpha pro tech branded products to other distributors 
this has enabled us to gain additional market share as we develop relationships with other industrial and cleanroom distributors 
we continue to be encouraged by the acceptance of our product line by our expanded distribution channel 
infection control segment sales for the year ended december  decreased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of mask sales in this segment were down by  and shield sales were up by  mask sales were down primarily due to lower sales of our n niosh approved respirator mask as concerns about avian flu have abated in and shield sales were strong primarily due to a large non recurring order in the first quarter of unless worldwide concerns about avian flu increase  we expect n respirator mask sales in to be similar to engineered products segment sales for the year ended december  decreased by  or to  as compared to  for the same period of the decrease for the year is primarily due to a decrease in sales of rex wrap house wrap as sales of rex synfelt synthetic roof underlayment were flat 
the breakdown of the engineered products sales is as follows for the year ended december  house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment 
this compares to house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment for the year ended december  the engineered products segment decrease for is the result of two factors 
firstly  a change in distribution channel strategy in which we decided to move forward on a non exclusive basis with our former distributor  which led the distributor to source product from other suppliers and to ultimately discontinue purchasing from us 
secondly  the downturn in the housing market has hurt our sales  in particular our house wrap line  as fewer houses are being built and distributors are keeping inventories low 
we expect that our new distribution channel strategy for the engineered products segment will broaden our ability to take advantage of market opportunities for synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap in during  we increased our sales team  launched a marketing campaign to introduce our new synthetic roof underlayment under the name of rex synfelt and launched our new house wrap under the name of rex wrap 
we anticipate that in fiscal our existing distributors will convert more business to us 
we also expect to obtain additional distributors as part of our new distribution strategy 
sales from our extended care segment decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in sales is primarily the result of lower medical bed pad sales of  and lower pet bed sales of  this line of products is not expected to be a growth segment for the company 
gross profit gross profit decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the gross profit margin was for the year ended december  and december  the gross profit margin on the engineered products segment has improved for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of although the gross profit margin in the engineered products segment is lower than the overall company margin  we expect it to continue to improve as sales grow 
the gross profit margin on the disposable protective apparel segment was down slightly due to increased costs from china 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the increase is primarily due to increased expenses for the engineered products segment of  a severance agreement of  for our previous senior vp of manufacturing in april  increased employee compensation of  increased expenses for travel to asia of  and increased marketing expenses of  the engineered products segment increase of  is broken down as follows a  increase in employee compensation  a  increase in marketing expenses  an  increase in commission for independent representatives  a  increase in travel expenses and a  increase in insurance expenses  partially offset by a  decrease in miscellaneous expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the chief executive officer and president are each entitled to a bonus equal to of the pre tax profits of the company 
bonuses of  were accrued for the year ended december  as compared to  in the same period of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to an increased depreciation for engineered products 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to income from operations of  for the year ended december  the decrease in income from operations is due to a decrease in gross profit of  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  and an increase in depreciation and amortization of  equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates 
for the year ended december   we recorded equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates of  as compared to  for the same period of the net change in equity in income is primarily due to a gain of  on a foreign currency exchange contract that occurred in the third quarter of net interest 
for the year ended december   we had net interest income of  compared to net interest income of  for the year ended december  interest income increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period of  due to higher cash balances

income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease in income before provision for income taxes is due to a decrease in income from operations of  partially offset by an increase in net interest income of  and a net increase of  from our unconsolidated affiliate harmony 
based on the analysis of segment income excluding corporate overhead allocations  a primary reason for the decline in income before provision for income tax was due to a net decrease of  in the engineered products segment 
this segment experienced a loss of  for the year ended december  as compared to income of  for the same period of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a reduction in state taxes

fiscal compared to fiscal sales consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased sales of engineered products of  to increased sales of disposable protective apparel products of  and to increased infection control segment sales of  partially offset by decreased sales from our extended care products of  sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the year ended december  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the increase was primarily due to increased sales of approximately million to our largest distributor  and an approximate million increase due to other distributors that concentrate on the cleanroom and industrial safety industries 
although disposable protective apparel sales increased by only a modest in  the second half of was strong 
sales for the fourth quarter of million were up from million in the fourth quarter of in addition  sales were up in the third and fourth quarter of as compared to the first and second quarters of and were up as compared to the third and fourth quarter of in we introduced a new line of disposable protective apparel products under the name of comfortech  a new material that we developed over the past two years 
in the latter half of we introduced a new category of the comfortech line  comfortech certified 
this is an entirely new class of products designed to decrease the risk of bioburden contamination in our target markets 
as well  in we will be bringing to market the comfortech sterile line of products 
on september  we announced the signing of a new distribution contract with our largest distributor of disposable protective apparel 
under the terms of the multiple year contract that was effective january   they will retain the exclusive right to sell our private label critical cover products 
in addition  we will now have the right to sell alpha pro tech branded products to other new distributors 
this new contract further strengthens our relationship with our largest distributor and will enable us to gain additional market share as we develop relationships with new distributors

engineered products sales for the year ended december  increased by  or to  as compared to  for the same period of the breakdown of the engineered products sales is as follows for the year ended december  house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment 
this compares to house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment and antimicrobial paint for the year ended december  synthetic roof underlayment sales for the year ended december  increased by as compared to the same period of this increase was facilitated in part by the fact that in october  we received notice of acceptance from the miami dade county building code compliance office for our synthetic roof underlayment alphaprotector sul which is recognized as possessing stringent criteria for building products 
also  in december  we announced that our synthetic roof underlayment had received the international code council icc es approval 
the icc governs the international building code ibc which oversees most building departments around the country 
these approvals significantly expand our synthetic roof underlayment opportunities as many construction supply companies require one or both of these certifications to sell our product 
in we entered into two agreements with perma r products  inc for house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment 
as part of these year mutually exclusive agreements  they agreed to purchase a minimum of million per year in house wrap and million in synthetic roof underlayment 
in they did not meet the annual minimums for either product

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we subcontract the manufacture of products in china and to a lesser extent in mexico and have a joint venture in india 
in addition  our executive office  which employees people  is located in canada 
our results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to stronger economic conditions in those countries 
we believe we do not have a material foreign currency exposure due to the fact that our purchase agreements with companies in china  india and mexico are in us dollars 
in canada our foreign currency exposure is not material due to the fact that we do not manufacture in canada 
we do not expect any significant effect on our results of operations from inflation or interest and currency rate fluctuations 
we do not hedge our interest rate or foreign exchange risks
