our investment is accounted for prospectively using the equity method of accounting 
unless specifically noted  amounts presented for the integrated gas segment for periods prior to may  include amounts related to the minority interests 
unless specifically noted  amounts for the rm t segment include the percent interest in mpc held by ashland prior our acquisition of that interest on june  overview acquisition of western oil sands inc on october   we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of western for cash and securities of billion 
western s debt was billion at closing 
western s primary asset was a percent outside operated interest in the aosp  which is located in the province of alberta  canada 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  as such  our results of operations include western s results from october  western s oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment  while its ownership interests in leases where in situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment 
exploration and production exploration and production segment revenues correlate with prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas we produce 
higher crude oil prices in primarily reflected increasing global demand and ongoing concerns about supplies of crude oil from oil producing countries 
during  the average spot price per barrel for west texas intermediate wti  a benchmark crude oil  was  up from an average of in  and ended the year at 
during  the average spot price per barrel for dated brent brent  an international benchmark crude oil  was  up from an average of in  and ended the year at 
the differential between wti and brent average prices narrowed to in from in our domestic crude oil production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content than light sweet wti 
heavier and higher sulfur crude oil commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil 
our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude oil benchmark 
natural gas prices were lower in than in a significant portion of our us lower states natural gas production is sold at bid week prices or first of month indices relative to our specific producing areas 
the average henry hub first of month price index was per thousand cubic feet mcf lower in than the average 
our natural gas prices in alaska are largely contractual 
natural gas sales there are seasonal in nature  trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first 
table of contents 
index to financial statements quarters 
our other major natural gas producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea  where large portions of our natural gas are sold at contractual prices  making realized prices in these areas less volatile 
the significant increase in sales of natural gas in equatorial guinea  at a fixed price  to the new lng production facility discussed below contributed to the decrease in our average international realized natural gas prices

e p segment income during was down percent from  primarily as a result of lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and natural gas realizations and increased exploration expenses  partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and natural gas sales volumes 
oil sands mining our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations were acquired in october as part of our acquisition of western and are comprised of a percent outside operated interest in the aosp  which includes the operating muskeg river mine and the scotford upgrader  located in alberta  canada 
the bitumen production from the muskeg river mine is taken by pipeline to the scotford upgrader  which uses hydro conversion technology to upgrade the bitumen into a range of high quality  synthetic crude oils 
when the aosp is operating at current capacity  our net bitumen production is mbpd  but operations were curtailed at the scotford upgrader subsequent to the western acquisition date due to a mid november fire 
maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs 
the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december 
oil sands mining segment revenues correlate with prevailing prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil we produce and the cost of materials and supplies input during the upgrading process also correlate with market prices for commodities 
the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed  and therefore many of the costs incurred when the aosp is in full operation continue during any production downtime 
this had a negative effect on segment income subsequent to the acquisition date as a result of the downtime associated with the fire and maintenance activities discussed above

refining  marketing and transportation rm t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin  refinery throughputs  retail marketing gross margins for gasoline  distillates and merchandise  and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations 
the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined  the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses  including depreciation 
as a result  our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other charge and blendstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace 
the crack spread  which is generally a measure of the difference between market prices for gasoline and distillate and crude oil costs  is a commonly used industry indicator of refining margins 
in addition to changes in the crack spread  our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks we process  the selling prices we realize for all the refined products we sell  the cost of purchased products  our level of manufacturing costs and the impact of commodity derivative instruments we use in our rm t operations primarily to mitigate price risk between the time that crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products 
we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances our profitability compared to certain of our competitors as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil 
over the last three years  percent of the crude oil throughput at our refineries has been sour crude oil 
as one of the largest us producers of asphalt  our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is also impacted by the selling price of asphalt 
sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in our market area  which is typically in the second and third quarters of each year 
the selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil  the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors 
we supplement our refining production by purchasing gasolines and distillates in the spot market to resell at wholesale 
in addition  we purchase ethanol for blending with gasoline 
our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the cost of these 
table of contents 
index to financial statements purchased products  which varies with available supply and demand 
finally  our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs from period to period  which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas used for plant fuel 
our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in our various marketing areas  the availability of refined product supply  the regulatory climate  logistical capabilities and expectations regarding the adequacy of refined products  ethanol and raw material supplies 
our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin was the key driver of the percent decrease in rm t segment income when compared to the average refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon decreased to cents in from cents in  primarily due to the significant and rapid increases in crude oil prices during and lagging wholesale price realizations 
for information on commodity price risk management  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our seven refineries have an aggregate refining capacity of mmbpd of crude oil 
during  our refineries processed mmbpd of crude oil and mbpd of other charge and blend stocks 
our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates  which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of the refined products  including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes  also plays an important part in rm t segment profitability 
factors affecting our retail gasoline and distillate gross margin include competition  seasonal demand fluctuations  the available wholesale supply  the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact driving conditions 
the gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets tends to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and distillates 
factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items  the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in our marketing areas 
the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines 
the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of  and refiner demand for  crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines 
key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers  the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation  and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels 
the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of  and user demand for  refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines 
in most of our markets  demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season  which extends from may through september of each year  and declines during the fall and winter months 
the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this  helping to level overall variability on an annual basis 
as with crude oil  other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 
integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand 
our production facility in equatorial guinea that commenced operations during is a key component of this strategy 
our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas  such as lng and methanol  primarily in the united states  europe and west africa 
methanol spot pricing is volatile largely because global methanol demand is million tonnes and any major unplanned shutdown of or addition to production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply demand balance 
also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of integrated gas projects  including natural gas technology research

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depreciated  depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely  in part  on estimates of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
during  net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by million boe less than percent of the beginning of the year reserves estimate 
positive revisions of million boe were partially offset by million boe in negative revisions

reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by members of our corporate reserves group 
any change to proved reserves estimates in excess of million boe on a total field basis  within a single month  must be approved by the director of corporate reserves  who reports to our chief financial officer 
the corporate reserves group may also perform separate  detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives  sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions 
third party consultants are engaged to prepare independent reserve estimates for fields that rank in the top percent of our total reserves over a rolling four year period 
the volumes independently estimated are targeted to total at least percent of our total reserves at the beginning of the fourth year 
we met this goal for the four year period ended december  for and thereafter  we established a tolerance level of percent for third party reserve estimates such that the third party consultants discontinue their estimation activities once their results are within percent of our internal estimates 
should the third party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level  the consultants re examine the information provided  request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate 
if  after this re examination  the third party consultants cannot arrive at estimates within our tolerance  we would adjust our reserve estimates as necessary 
this independent third party reserve estimation process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in  or the reserves of the alba field in equatorial guinea comprise percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december  the reserves of the next five largest asset groups the waha concessions in libya  the alvheim vilje development offshore norway  the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom  the oregon basin field in the rocky mountain area of the united states and the petronius development on viosca knoll blocks and in the gulf of mexico comprise percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves 
depreciation and depletion of producing liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties is determined by the units of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves 
the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant 
on average  a five percent increase in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately per barrel  which would increase pretax income by approximately million annually  based on production 
on average  a five percent decrease in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately million annually  based on production 
proved bitumen reserves we acquired a percent outside operated interest in the aosp in alberta  canada with the acquisition of western in october oil sands mining operations at the aosp are outside the scope of sfas nos 
and and sec rule of regulation s x  therefore  bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities 
the estimated amount of proved bitumen reserves affects the amount and timing of costs depreciated  depleted or amortized into net income 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets used in allocating the western acquisition purchase price and in testing oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets for impairment also rely  in part  on estimates of proved bitumen reserves 
reserves related to oil sands mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proved bitumen reserves as of december  were estimated using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves 
proved bitumen reserves were estimated at october   the date of the western acquisition  based on the third party consultants estimate as of december   adjusted for production through the acquisition date 
depreciation and depletion of most oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets is determined by the units of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved bitumen reserves 
a five percent

fair value estimates we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions  to assess impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets and to record non exchange traded derivative instruments 
other items that require fair value estimates include asset retirement obligations  guarantee obligations and stock based compensation 
under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for certain acquisitions  engage third party consultants for assistance 
during  we made a significant acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of billion that was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on this acquisition 
we did not make any significant acquisitions in as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion 
such goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value 
the fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition and to test goodwill for impairment are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method  which requires us to project related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate 
the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 
long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for purposes of impairment evaluation  long lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified  which generally is field by field for e p assets  expansion project level for oil sands mining assets  refinery and associated distribution system level or pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets  or site level for retail stores 
if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group  the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value 
estimating the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups and our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets requires assumptions about matters such as future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices  estimated recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and bitumen  expected timing of production and the political environment in the host country 
an impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing properties or our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we evaluate our unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach 
information such as drilling results  reservoir performance  seismic interpretation and or future plans to develop acreage are also considered 
the expected future cash flows from our rm t assets require assumptions about matters such as future refined product prices  future crude oil and other feedstock costs  estimated remaining lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential 
impairment charges have not been significant  totaling million and million in and  while there were no impairment charges in we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
we have two long term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments 
these contracts expire in september these contracts were entered into in the early s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline 
the contract price is reset annually in october and is indexed to a basket of costs of living and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements energy commodity indices for the previous twelve months 
consequently  the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices 
the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the uk forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes under these contracts for the next months 
beginning in the second quarter of  the remaining contract terms will be less than months and therefore the forecasted valuation period will be reduced accordingly 
adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in non cash charges or credits to income from operations 
the difference between the contract price and the uk forward natural gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations 
in  and  non cash losses of million  gains of million and losses of million related to changes in the fair values of these contracts were recognized in income from operations 
these effects are primarily due to the uk month forward natural gas price curve strengthening percent in  weakening percent in and strengthening percent in expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets 
as of december   we reported total deferred tax assets of billion  which represented gross assets of billion net of valuation allowances of billion 
numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events  such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices and future financial conditions 
the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets  forecasts and strategic plans 
in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances  we consider proved and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties  as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related to undeveloped discoveries if  in our judgment  it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future 
in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance  we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset 
additionally  we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets  if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occurred 
the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the following the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  the expected long term return on plan assets  the rate of future increases in compensation levels  and health care cost projections 
we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
we have selected different discount rates for our funded us pension plans and our unfunded us retiree health care plan due to the different projected liability durations of years and years 
in determining the assumed discount rates  our methods include a review of market yields on high quality corporate debt and use of our third party actuary s discount rate modeling tool 
this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve 
the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from to years 
the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized 
table of contents 
index to financial statements rating agency and only non callable bonds are included 
each issue is required to have at least million par value outstanding 
the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve 
the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately percent equity securities and percent debt securities for the us funded pension plans and percent equity securities and percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans  past performance and other factors 
certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation  debt returns and stock yields 
our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies and to historical returns for reasonableness and appropriateness 
compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience  anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense for  and  as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets as of december  and of the assumptions used to measure the december  obligations and estimated net periodic benefit cost  the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans 
a percent decrease in the discount rates of percent for our us pension plans and percent for our other us postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by million and million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by million and million 
in  we made certain plan design changes which included an update of the mortality table used in the plans definition of actuarial equivalence and lump sum calculations and a percent retiree cost of living adjustment for annuitants 
this change increased our benefit obligations by million 
in  we decreased our retirement age assumption by two years and also increased our lump sum election rate from percent to percent based on changing trends in our experience 
this change increased our benefit obligations by million 
there were no plan design changes in contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation  tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes  product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable 
actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons 
for instance  settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws  opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages 
similarly  liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws  regulations and their interpretation  additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination  and improvements in technology 
our in house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities 
in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel is utilized 
we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income  except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes  which are recorded as other taxes 
for additional information on contingent liabilities  see management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies 
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed  the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes  in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of results of operations change in accounting for matching buy sell transactions matching buy sell transactions arise from arrangements in which we agree to buy a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined product to be delivered to a specified location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of the same commodity at a specified location to the same counterparty 
prior to april   all matching buy sell transactions were recorded as separate sale and purchase transactions  or on a gross basis 
effective for contracts entered into or modified on or after april   the income effects of matching buy sell transactions are reported in cost of revenues  or on a net basis 
transactions under contracts entered into before april  will continue to be reported on a gross basis 
this accounting change had no effect on net income but the amounts of revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april  are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  this accounting change impacts the comparability of certain operating statistics  most notably refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon 
while this change does not have an effect on the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin the numerator for calculating this statistic  sales volumes the denominator for calculating this statistic recognized after april  are less than the amount that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices because volumes related to matching buy sell transactions under contracts entered into or modified on or after april  have been excluded 
accordingly  the resulting refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon statistic will be higher than that same statistic calculated from amounts determined under previous accounting practices 
as a result  this accounting change impacts the comparability of revenues  cost of revenues and the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon for all periods presented

higher liquid hydrocarbon realized prices were not sufficient to offset the impact of sales volume declines as illustrated in the table below 
both liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes from domestic operations decreased in primarily due to normal production declines in the gulf of mexico and permian basin  while international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were lower primarily because our libya sales returned to normal levels compared to  which included volumes owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations there 
while international natural gas sales volumes increased  the majority of the increase was due to the start up of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea in the second quarter of this increase in fixed price sales volumes also contributed to the decline in our average international natural gas realizations

management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
if these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  marketing areas  production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 
our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were a in millions capital compliance operating and maintenance remediation b total a amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines regarding the definition of environmental expenditures

table of contents 
index to financial statements our environmental capital expenditures accounted for four percent of capital expenditures for continuing operations in  five percent in and percent in we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated 
as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise  charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 
new or expanded environmental requirements  which could increase our environmental costs  may arise in the future 
we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations  it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance  including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 
our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million or percent of capital expenditures in predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies  among other matters 
based on currently identified projects  we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed

the budget includes worldwide production spending of billion  primarily in the united states for expansion of the bakken shale and piceance basin resource plays and development of the droshky prospect in the gulf of mexico  but also in norway and angola 
the worldwide exploration budget of billion includes plans to drill six to ten exploration or appraisal wells 
it also includes million related to our high bids on leases from the october gulf of mexico lease sale which were awarded in early other exploration plans include activity within or adjacent to our onshore producing properties in the united states  appraisal drilling and pre feed costs in angola  and evaluation drilling and feasibility studies of the in situ recovery projects in canada 
the budget includes million for the oil sands mining segment  primarily for the phase expansion of the aosp which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine  expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine  expansion of the scotford upgrader and development of associated infrastructure 
the budget includes billion for rm t  primarily for the garyville refinery expansion and the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project 
the rm t budget also includes increased investments in transportation  logistics and marketing assets 
the integrated gas segment budget of million is substantially lower than because construction on the lng production facility in equatorial guinea was completed and the facility began operations in the remaining million is designated for capitalized interest and corporate activities 
this capital  investment and exploration budget represents a significant increase over our spending 
consistent with our philosophy of maintaining financial discipline and flexibility  we have commenced a review of our portfolio of assets with the intent of monetizing those assets which are either mature or otherwise non strategic  thus allowing us to re deploy our capital into the projects included in our capital  investment and exploration budget

exploration and production we announced nine discoveries in eight in deepwater angola and one in the gulf of mexico 
major exploration activities  which are currently underway or under evaluation  include those offshore angola  on block in which we hold a percent outside operated interest and have announced discoveries  and on block  in which we hold a percent outside operated interest and have announced discoveries 
we plan to participate in four to five exploration or appraisal wells in these deepwater blocks in current plans call for a potential development area in the northeastern part of block  which encompasses the plutao  saturno  venus and marte discoveries 
additional potential development areas lie in the southeast and middle portions of the block 
seven of the block discoveries form our first potential development in the eastern area of that block 
in equatorial guinea  where we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block  one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure 
we own a percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator  in norway  where we now own interests in licenses covering over  gross acres offshore and plan to drill one or two exploration wells during  in the united kingdom  where we plan to participate in the uk onshore licensing round during to secure additional coal bed methane acreage  and in the gulf of mexico  where we plan to participate in two to three exploration wells during during  we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years 
major development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those in the gulf of mexico  with the neptune development and the droshky discovery 
the neptune development  in which we own a percent outside operated working interest  is on target for first production by early development of the droshky discovery  in which we own a percent working interest  is expected to be sanctioned during  with first production as early as dependent upon delivery of key equipment and regulatory approvals 
rig capacity has been secured for droshky development drilling 
in norway  where our alvheim vilje development will consist of an fpso vessel with subsea infrastructure 
the fpso sailed from the shipyard in mid february to undergo testing  after which it will proceed offshore for connection to the subsea infrastructure 
first production is expected at the end of the first quarter of  weather permitting  at which time six wells will be available 
drilling activities will continue in a peak net production rate of mboepd is expected in we are the operator of the alvheim development  which includes the kameleon and kneler discoveries  in which we have a percent working interest  and the boa discovery  in which we have a percent working interest 
we own a percent outside operated interest in the nearby vilje discovery 
also  the volund discovery  a tie back to the alvheim fpso continues to make progress towards first production in we own a percent interest in volund and serve as operator

we own a percent outside operated interest in the approximately million acre waha concessions  in ireland  where the corrib natural gas development project continues and the operator expects first production in we own a percent outside operated interest in corrib  in the piceance basin of colorado  where we have two drilling rigs running  and plan to increase the rig count to four by the end of  drilling wells in the region over the next two years  and in the williston basin of north dakota and eastern montana the bakken shale formation  where we have six rigs running and plan to drill approximately locations over the next four to five years 
with the alvheim vilje and neptune developments coming online  we estimate that our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales will average approximately to mboepd  excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
projected liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are based on a number of assumptions  including among others pricing  supply and demand for petroleum products  the amount of capital available for exploration and development  regulatory constraints  timing of commencing production from new wells  drilling rig availability  inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals and permits  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response  and other geological  operating and economic considerations 
these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling  the possibility of developing blocks and offshore angola and the droshky discovery in the gulf of mexico  the timing of production from the neptune development  the droshky discovery  the alvheim vilje development  the volund field and the corrib project 
some factors which could potentially affect these forward looking statements include pricing  supply and demand for petroleum products  the amount of capital available for exploration and development  regulatory constraints  drilling rig availability  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response  and other geological  operating and economic considerations 
except for the neptune  alvheim vilje and volund developments  the foregoing forward looking statements may be further affected by the inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals and permits 
the possible developments of the droshky discovery and blocks and offshore angola could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs  economic recoverability  future drilling success and production experience 
the foregoing factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil  natural gas and refined product prices 
we employ various strategies  including the use of commodity derivative instruments  to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations 
we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ various strategies  including the use of financial derivative instruments  to manage the risks related to these fluctuations 
we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 
we believe that our use of derivative instruments  along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose us to material adverse consequences 
while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods  we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
commodity price risk our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  swaps and combinations of options  as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses 
we also may utilize the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 
our e p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the natural gas price risk during the time that the natural gas is held in storage before it is sold or on natural gas that is purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production 
we also may use commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas when it is deemed advantageous to do so 
certain long term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments are excluded from e p segment income 
for additional information on these uk natural gas contracts  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates fair value estimates 
our osm segment uses commodity derivative instruments to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of synthetic crude oil when it is deemed advantageous to do so 
our rm t segment uses commodity derivative instruments on a selective basis  primarily to mitigate crude oil price risk between the time that crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products or during the time that crude oil inventories are held before they are actually refined into salable petroleum products 
to a lesser extent  we also use derivative instruments in our rm t segment to manage price risk related to refined petroleum products  feedstocks used in the refining process and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products 
our strategies allow us to realize acceptable margins for our various refined products but at times may limit our ability to take advantage of certain market opportunities 
additionally  certain contracts in our rm t segment involving the purchase or sale of commodities are not considered normal purchases or normal sales under generally accepted accounting principles and are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments 
generally  commodity derivative instruments used in our e p segment qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result  we do not recognize in net income any changes in the fair value of those derivative instruments until the underlying physical transaction occurs 
we have not attempted to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our osm or rm t segments for hedge accounting 
as a result  we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in those operations

at december   we had no open derivative contracts related to our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and therefore remained substantially exposed to market prices of these commodities 
at october   western held crude oil put options purchased in october for the three year period beginning january  the premiums for the purchased put options had been partially offset through the sale of call options for the same three year period  resulting in a net premium liability

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles 
we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the creditworthiness of counterparties is reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical 
changes to the portfolio after december   would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 
b the number of net open contracts for the e p segment varied throughout  from a low of contracts on april   to a high of  contracts on march   and averaged for the year 
the number of net open contracts for the rm t segment varied throughout  from a low of contracts on february   to a high of  contracts on september   and averaged  for the year 
the number of net open contracts for the osm segment varied throughout  from a low of  contracts on december  to a high of  contracts on october   the western acquisition date  and averaged  for the post acquisition period 
the commodity derivative instruments used and positions taken will vary and  because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time  the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects

pretax derivative losses of million were included in osm segment income for these losses primarily resulted from the increase in crude oil prices since the acquisition date of western

we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments 
the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt in our portfolio 
we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates 
the following table summarizes our interest rate swaps as of december  in millions fixed rate to be received notional amount swap maturity fair value floating rate to be paid six month libor six month libor sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent change in interest rates is provided in the following table

accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for the carrying value of these instruments 
c fair value was based on market prices where available  or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 
d for receivables from united states steel and long term debt  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of our long term debt at december  for interest rate swap agreements  this assumes a percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements at december   our portfolio of long term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed rate debt at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward and option contracts 
the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates by locking in such rates 
the following table summarizes our derivative foreign currency instruments as of december  dollars in millions period notional amount average forward rate a fair value b foreign currency forwards euro january november c kroner norway january october d dollar canada february d a rates shown are weighted average forward rates for the period 
b fair value was based on market rates 
c us dollar to foreign currency 
d foreign currency to us dollar 
the aggregate cash flow effect on foreign currency forward contracts of a hypothetical percent change to exchange rates at december   would be approximately million 
during  we entered into derivative foreign currency instruments with a notional amount of billion to limit our exposure to changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate related to the cash portion of the purchase for western 
these derivative instruments were settled on october   and a pretax gain of million was recognized 
safe harbor these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas  refined products and other feedstocks 
if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
