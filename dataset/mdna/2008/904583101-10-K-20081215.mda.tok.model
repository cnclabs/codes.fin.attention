staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and no 
provide supplemental guidance for sfas no

 business combinations  and our operating results therefore include the results of marketsoft beginning on the acquisition date

the merger consideration consisted of million 
table of contents in cash   shares of our common stock valued at million  which were deposited into an escrow account to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former members of sane  and assumed liabilities and transaction costs of million

the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
 and our operating results therefore include the results of sane beginning on the acquisition date 
on july   we acquired by merger marketingcentral  llc marketingcentral  a provider of web based marketing management solutions 
the merger consideration consisted of million in cash  as well as transaction costs and the assumption of liabilities of marketingcentral

 and our operating results therefore include the results of marketingcentral beginning on the acquisition date 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the application of gaap requires that we make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we sell our software products and services together in a multiple element arrangement under perpetual and subscription agreements 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements 
each license arrangement requires that we analyze the individual elements in the transaction and determine the fair value of each undelivered element  which typically includes maintenance and services 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for perpetual license agreements  we generally estimate the fair value of the maintenance portion of an arrangement based on the maintenance renewal price for that arrangement 
in multiple element perpetual license arrangements where we sell maintenance for less than fair value  we defer the contractual price of the maintenance plus the difference between such contractual price and the fair value of maintenance over the expected life of the product 
we make a corresponding reduction in license revenue 
the fair value of the professional services portion of perpetual license arrangements is based on the rates that we charge for these services when sold separately 
if  in our judgment  evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the elements for which evidence of fair value could not be established are delivered 
revenue for implementation services of our software products that are not deemed essential to the functionality of the software products is recognized separately from license and subscription revenue 
if we were to determine that services are essential to the functionality of software in an arrangement  the license or subscription and services revenue from the arrangement would be recognized pursuant to sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts and certain production type contracts 
in such cases  we 
table of contents expect that we would be able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to the extent of progress toward completion by comparing the total hours incurred to the estimated total hours for the arrangement and  accordingly  we would apply the percentage of completion method 
if we were unable to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress towards completion  then we would use the completed contract method  under which revenue is recognized only upon completion of the services 
if total cost estimates exceed the anticipated revenue  then the estimated loss on the arrangement is recorded at the inception of the arrangement or at the time the loss becomes apparent 
we enter into subscription agreements that include  on a bundled basis  a the right to use our software for a specified period of time  b updates and upgrades to our software on a when and if available basis  and c technical support 
fees paid in connection with a subscription agreement are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
for all of our software arrangements  we do not recognize revenue until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and we deem collection to be probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
for the majority of our arrangements  we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
in transactions below a certain dollar threshold involving the sale of our affinium netinsight tm product  we consider a purchase order signed by the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
we consider delivery to have occurred when a cd or other medium containing the licensed software is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize the revenue when the refund or adjustment right lapses 
if the payments are due beyond our normal terms  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable or as cash is collected 
collection is deemed probable 
customers are evaluated for creditworthiness through our credit review process at the inception of the arrangement 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we cannot conclude that collection is probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
in our agreements with customers and msps  we provide a limited warranty that our software will perform in a manner consistent with our documentation under normal use and circumstances 
in the event of a breach of this limited warranty  we must repair or replace the software or  if those remedies are insufficient  provide a refund 
these agreements generally do not include any other right of return or any cancellation clause or conditions of acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts in addition to our initial credit evaluations at the inception of arrangements  we regularly assess our ability to collect outstanding customer invoices and in so doing must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that the collection of an outstanding customer receivable is not probable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts experience  customer creditworthiness  and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 

table of contents share based compensation we account for share based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
pursuant to sfas r  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions as to volatility  risk free interest rate  expected term of the awards  and expected forfeiture rate 
the computation of expected volatility is based on a study of historical volatility rates of comparable companies during a period comparable to the expected option term 
the estimated risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury risk free interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
the computation of expected option term is based on an average of the vesting term and the maximum contractual life of the company s stock options  as described in sab and sab computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of the company s stock options 
for options and other awards accounted for under sfas no 
r  the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
in addition  certain tax effects of share based compensation are reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the statement of cash flows 
goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets associated with various acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not subject to amortization 
we allocated a portion of each purchase price to intangible assets  including customer contracts and related customer relationships  developed technology  trade names and acquired licenses that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to years 
we also allocated a portion of each purchase price to tangible assets and assessed the liabilities to be recorded as part of the purchase price 
the estimates we made in allocating each purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  and in assessing liabilities recorded as part of the purchase  involved the application of judgment and the use of estimates  which could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value by computing our expected future discounted operating cash flows based on historical trends  which we adjust to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the estimates we make in determining the fair value of each reporting unit involve the application of judgment  including the amount and timing of future cash flows  short and long term growth rates  and the weighted average cost of capital  which could affect the timing and size of any future impairment charges 
impairment of our goodwill could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
based on our most recent assessment  there were no goodwill impairment indicators 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
we must use judgment in evaluating whether events or circumstances indicate that useful lives should change or that the carrying value of assets has been impaired 
any resulting revision in the useful life or the amount of an impairment also requires judgment 
any of these judgments could affect the timing or size of any future impairment charges 
revision of useful lives or impairment charges could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
software development costs we evaluate whether to capitalize or expense software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
we sell products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
accordingly  we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until 
table of contents the development stage of the product is nearly complete 
we define technological feasibility as the completion of a working model 
we amortize software development costs  capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 over their estimated useful lives of two years 
during the years ended september   and  we capitalized   and  respectively  of software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
we capitalize certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of corporate software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  will be capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
during the years ended september   and   and  respectively  of internal use software development costs were capitalized 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
significant changes to those estimates could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
in making these determinations  we estimate tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance must be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at september   the company considered both positive and negative evidence in determining the likelihood of realizing its us federal and state deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period under the tax laws 
the company has relied on historical earnings and its ability to accurately forecast earnings as positive evidence that its us deferred tax assets would be realized and that a valuation allowance was not required through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  other than the previously established valuation allowance associated with state research and development credits 
however  negative evidence has accumulated since that time 
the global economy has deteriorated significantly since the third quarter of fiscal  which negatively impacted the company s fourth quarter of fiscal results 
although the company has adjusted its forecasts accordingly  it has determined that its current visibility to future results is limited and there is uncertainty as to its ability to accurately predict future results in the current economic environment 
as such  the company has determined that recent negative results should be considered indicative of future results 
based on the weight of all of the available evidence  the company determined that it is more likely than not that all of the us federal and state deferred tax assets may not be realized and that a valuation allowance should be recorded against the net balance of these deferred tax assets as of september  accordingly  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million during the three months ended september  to reduce the net balance of these deferred tax assets to zero 
approximately million of the valuation allowance had a net impact on the company s consolidated income statement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and 
table of contents penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
there was no cumulative effect upon adoption of fin contingencies from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  we may be subject to various claims  charges and litigation 
in some cases  the claimants may seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue the estimated costs of settlement or damages when a loss is deemed probable and such costs are estimable 
in accordance with eitf topic d  accounting for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  we accrue for legal costs related to a loss contingency when a loss is probable and such amounts are estimable 
otherwise  these costs are expensed as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss or defense costs is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
valuation of business combinations we record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including developed technology  customer contracts and related customer relationships  tradenames and in process research and development 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
the valuation of in process research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our in process research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition

s federal and state deferred tax assets during the three months ended september  during the year ended september  and  our effective tax rate is different from the statutory tax rate due to the tax impact of recording the valuation allowance during fiscal against the company s us federal and state deferred tax assets and accounting for share based compensation pursuant sfas no 
r 
during the three months ended september   we recorded an million valuation allowance against the company s us federal and state deferred tax assets 
approximately million of the valuation allowance had a net impact on the company s consolidated income statement 
the company considered both positive and negative evidence in determining the likelihood of realizing its us federal and state deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period under the tax laws 
the company has relied on historical earnings and its ability to accurately forecast earnings as positive evidence that its us deferred tax assets would be realized and that a valuation allowance was not required through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  other than the previously established valuation allowance associated with state research and development credits 
however  negative evidence has accumulated since that time 
the global economy has deteriorated significantly since the third quarter of fiscal  which negatively impacted the company s fourth quarter of fiscal results 
although the company has adjusted its forecasts accordingly  it has determined that its current visibility to future results is limited and there is uncertainty as to its ability to accurately predict future results in the current economic environment 
as such  the company has determined that recent negative results should be considered indicative of future results 
based on the weight of all of the available evidence  the company determined that it is more likely than not that all of the us federal and state deferred tax assets may not be realized and that a valuation allowance should be recorded against the net balance of these deferred tax assets as of september

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
some of our agreements with foreign customers involve payments denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which may create foreign currency exchange risks for us 
revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented of total revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal as of september   we had million of receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
if the foreign exchange rates fluctuated by as of september   the fair value of our receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar would have fluctuated by million 
in addition  our subsidiaries have intercompany accounts that are eliminated in consolidation  but that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
exchange rate fluctuations on short term intercompany accounts are reported in other income expense 
exchange rate fluctuations on long term intercompany accounts  which are invested indefinitely without repayment terms  are recorded in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
interest rate risk at september   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds and government agency securities  and are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that  due to the size and duration of our investment portfolio  a basis point increase in interest rates would not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our portfolio at september  declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income
