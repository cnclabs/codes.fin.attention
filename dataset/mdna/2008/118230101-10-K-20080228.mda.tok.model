operating segments the partnership has determined that its  and operations are appropriately presented in three operating segments pipeline operations  terminalling and storage  and other operations 
pipeline operations segment the pipeline operations segment receives petroleum products including gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel and other distillates and natural gas liquids from refineries  connecting pipelines and bulk and marine terminals and transports those products to other locations by pipeline for a fee 
as of december   this segment owned and operated approximately  miles of pipelines in the following states california  colorado  connecticut  florida  illinois  indiana  kansas  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and tennessee 
terminalling and storage segment the terminalling and storage segment provides bulk storage and terminal throughput services 
at december   this segment consisted of active terminals that had the capacity to store an aggregate of approximately million barrels of refined petroleum products 
the terminals are located in illinois  indiana  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and wisconsin 
other operations segment the other operations segment consists primarily of the partnership s operation of third party pipelines owned principally by major petrochemical companies pursuant to operations and maintenance contracts 
the third party pipelines are located primarily in louisiana  ohio  and texas 
this segment also includes the provision by the partnership  through its buckeye gulf coast subsidiary  of pipeline construction management services  typically on a cost plus a fixed fee basis 
the other operations segment also includes the partnership s ownership and operation of an ammonia pipeline acquired in november  and its majority ownership of a crude butadiene pipeline located in texas 
results of operations summary the partnership has recorded increased revenues  operating income and net income in compared to  and compared to  primarily due to the expansion of the partnership s operations through pipeline and terminal acquisitions  increases in interstate pipeline tariff rates and terminalling throughput fees 
overall pipeline volumes have remained flat in as compared to summary operating results for the partnership were as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts revenue    costs and expenses    operating income    other income expenses    net income    allocation of net income net income allocated to general partner   net income allocated to limited partners   earnings per limited partner unit basic earnings per limited partner unit diluted weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding basic    diluted    the partnership s net income in and reflects amendments to the partnership s incentive compensation agreement and agreement of limited partnership which recharacterized the incentive compensation paid to the general partner from a compensation payment to a partnership distribution  as described in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
these amendments affected the partnership s results of operations in the fourth quarter of and the entire fiscal year 
net income for and was million and million  respectively  higher than it would have been if the partnership s incentive compensation agreement and agreement of limited partnership had not been amended 
earnings per limited partner unit  as shown above  were impacted by the issuance of approximately million lp units in december  million lp units in august  million lp units in march  million lp units in march  million lp units in may  and million lp units in february ebitda and adjusted ebitda the following table summarizes ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the partnership for the years ended december   and ebitda  a measure not defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is defined by the partnership as income before interest expense including amortization and write off of deferred debt financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda  also a non gaap measure  is defined as ebitda plus the general partner incentive compensation expense 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda and adjusted ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 
the partnership has provided adjusted ebitda in addition to ebitda because  commencing in the fourth quarter of  the partnership reports incentive payments to the general partner as partnership distributions  rather than incentive compensation expense  which is how such payments were reported in periods prior to the fourth quarter of see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this change 
accordingly  the general partner incentive compensation presented below includes only three quarters of incentive payments for and does not include the million incentive payment paid in the fourth quarter of in  and future periods thereafter  net income will not include the general partner incentive payments 
management of the partnership uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures to assist in the analysis and assessment of the partnership s operations  to evaluate the viability of proposed projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the partnership believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures used by the partnership s management

derivative instruments in december  the partnership terminated an interest rate swap agreement associated with the notes due july  and received proceeds of million 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the partnership deferred the million gain as an adjustment to the fair value of the hedged portion of the partnership s debt and is amortizing the gain as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt 
interest expense was reduced by million during each of the years ended december  and related to the amortization of the gain on the interest rate swap 
in august and october  the partnership entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution for million and million notional amounts  respectively  in order to hedge the variability of future interest rates associated with a portion of the then anticipated issuance of debt to finance a portion of the lodi gas acquisition

in connection with this debt offering  the partnership settled the two interest rates swaps mentioned above  which resulted in a payment by the partnership of million 
the amount will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt 
the partnership s financial strategy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional lp units in connection with the partnership s acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios  including total debt to total capital 
from through the partnership has raised net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of its lp units in support of its acquisition and growth strategies 
the partnership may issue additional lp units in and beyond to partially fund acquisitions and internal growth activities  market conditions permitting 
the partnership is subject  however  to changes in the equity markets for its lp units  and there can be no assurance the partnership will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for its lp units in the future 
if the partnership were unable to issue additional lp units  the partnership would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue other debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs 
cash flows from operations the components of cash flows from operations for the years ended december   and were as follows cash flow from operations in thousands net income    depreciation and amortization    minority interests    changes in current assets and liabilities   changes in non current assets and liabilities  other  total    cash flows from operations were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the primary cause of this increase is the improvement in buckeye s net income for the period of million in compared to as discussed previously  net income in included incentive compensation expense of million 
this increase was offset by a reduction in other non current assets and liabilities of million and an additional million of cash used for working capital 
cash used for working capital resulted primarily from a reduction in accounts payable of million which was offset by reductions in trade receivables of million and prepaid and other current assets of million and an increase in accrued and other current liabilities of million 
the reduction in accounts payable is due to the timing of the payment of invoices at year end in as compared to the reduction in trade receivables is due to improvement in the timing of collections

the increase in accrued and other current liabilities is due to increases in accrued taxes offset by a reduction in environmental liabilities 
during  the increase in cash used in working capital resulted primarily from increases in trade receivables of million and prepaid and other current assets of million 
the increase in trade receivables was principally due to the expansion of the partnership s business the acquisition of the ngl pipeline and certain terminals along with the commencement of operations of the pipeline and terminal at the memphis international airport  as well as the timing of pipeline billings at year end 
the increase in prepaid and other current assets resulted from receivables of million related to activities on the ammonia pipeline purchased by the partnership in november  increases of million resulting from amounts determined to be recoverable from insurance companies related to environmental remediation expenditures  an increase in prepaid insurance of million as well as other increases totaling million 
a portion of the insurance receivables related to amounts billed to the insurance companies  with the balance relating to anticipated future expenditures at identified remediation sites 
these decreases in cash were partially offset by an increase in accrued and other current liabilities of million 
of this increase  million related to payables arising from activity on the ammonia pipeline purchased in november  million related to the current portion of environmental liabilities a portion of which is recoverable from insurance as described above and million related to other current liabilities 
the change in other assets and liabilities resulted principally from the absence in of the accrual of certain long term environmental liabilities which occurred in cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and were as follows investing activities in thousands capital expenditures    acquisitions and equity investments   net expenditures for disposal of property  plant and equipment total    in  the partnership expended million primarily for the acquisition of six terminals and related assets and million for an additional investment in west texas lpg pipeline limited partnership

purchase obligations generally represent commitments for recurring operating expenses or capital projects 
in addition  the partnership s obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans are discussed in the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters the operating subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations  as well as the partnership s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause the operating subsidiaries to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
environmental expenses are incurred in connection with emergency response activities associated with the release of petroleum products to the environment from the partnership s pipelines and terminals  and in connection with longer term environmental remediation efforts which may involve  for example  groundwater monitoring and treatment 
the partnership regularly incurs expenses in connection with these environmental remediation activities

the esop notes were issued on may  to refinance services company s notes which were originally issued to purchase services company common stock 
the esop notes are secured by  shares of services company s common stock 
the partnership has committed that  in the event that the value of the lp units owned by services company falls to less than of the balance payable under the esop notes  the partnership will fund an escrow account with sufficient assets to bring the value of the total collateral the value of the lp units owned by services company and the escrow account up to the minimum 
amounts deposited in the escrow account are returned to the partnership when the value of the lp units owned by services company returns to an amount which exceeds the minimum 
at december   the value of the lp units was approximately million  which exceeded the minimum requirement 
services company common stock is released to employee accounts in the proportion that current payments of principal and interest on the esop notes bear to the total of all principal and interest payments due under the esop notes 
individual employees are allocated shares based on the ratio of their eligible compensation to total eligible compensation 
eligible compensation generally includes base salary  overtime payments and certain bonuses 
the partnership contributed million lp units to services company in august in exchange for the elimination of the partnership s obligation to reimburse its general partner and the parent of its general partner for certain executive compensation costs  a reduction of the incentive compensation paid by the partnership to its general partner  and other changes that made the esop a less expensive fringe benefit for the partnership

total esop related costs charged to earnings were million in off balance sheet arrangements the partnership has no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to select appropriate accounting principles from those available  to apply those principles consistently and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect revenues and associated costs as well as reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
the following describes the estimated risks underlying buckeye s critical accounting policies and estimates depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are generally recorded at cost or fair value 
approximately of buckeye s consolidated assets consist of property  plant and equipment such as pipeline and related transportation facilities  land  rights of way  buildings  leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment 
the most significant of these assets are pipelines and related facilities  which  consistent with industry practice  are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost or fair value  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset 
the determination of an asset s useful life requires assumptions regarding a number of factors including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense that could have a material impact on our financial statements 
at december  and  the net book value of buckeye s consolidated property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
depreciation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
buckeye does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimated useful life of these assets 
in the past  buckeye has generally not deemed it necessary to materially change the depreciable lives of its assets 
however  a reduction in the depreciable life of these assets  from to years  would increase annual depreciation expense  and reduce operating income by approximately million annually 
reserves for environmental matters as discussed under environmental matters above  buckeye s operating subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations  and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or clean ups are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated based upon past experience and advice of outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with buckeye s commitment to a formal plan of action 
accrued environmental remediation related expenses include estimates of direct costs of remediation and indirect costs related to the remediation effort  such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
historically  buckeye s estimates of direct and indirect costs related to remediation efforts have generally not required material adjustments 
however the accounting estimates relative to environmental matters are uncertain because estimated future expenditures related to environmental matters are subject to cost fluctuations and can change materially  unanticipated liabilities may arise in connection with environmental remediation projects and may impact cost estimates  and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations can significantly increase the cost or potential liabilities related to environmental matters 
buckeye maintains insurance which may cover certain environmental expenditures 
during  and  buckeye s operating subsidiaries incurred environmental related operating expenses  net of insurance recoveries  of million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  buckeye s operating subsidiaries had accrued million and million  respectively  for environmental matters 
the environmental accruals are revised as new matters arise  or as new facts in connection with environmental remediation projects require a revision of estimates previously made with respect to the probable cost of such remediation projects 
changes in estimates of environmental remediation for each remediation project will affect operating income on a dollar for dollar basis up to buckeye s self insurance limit 
buckeye s self insurance limit is currently million per occurrence
