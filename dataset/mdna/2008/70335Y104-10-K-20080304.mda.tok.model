general we are a specialty finance company that provides customized financing solutions to small to mid sized companies 
our ability to invest across a company s capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer a comprehensive suite of financing solutions  including one stop financing 
in august  we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock for net proceeds including underwriters exercise of their over allotment of approximately million 
on july   we elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we have also elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
pursuant to this election  we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income or gains we distribute actually or as a deemed dividend to our stockholders as dividends  provided that we satisfy certain requirements 
since we commenced investment operations in  our business had been conducted through two separate entities  patriot capital funding  inc and wilton funding  llc 
patriot capital funding  inc originated  arranged and serviced the investments made by wilton funding  llc  which invested in debt instruments and warrants of us based companies 
for such services  patriot capital funding  inc was entitled to receive placement fees and servicing fees from wilton funding  llc s portfolio companies and investment origination fees and asset management fees from wilton funding  llc 
on july   wilton funding  llc merged with and into patriot capital funding  inc and then we effected a stock split 
upon completion of the merger and stock split  we had  shares of common stock outstanding prior to shares issued in the initial public offering 
prior to the completion of the initial public offering  compass group investments  inc beneficially owned all of our outstanding shares of stock 
the discussion herein of our financial statements reflect the combined operations of patriot capital funding  inc and wilton funding  llc prior to the merger and our consolidated results of our operations thereafter 
current market conditions the debt and equity capital markets in the united states have been severely impacted by significant write offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the repricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated loan market  among other things 
these events  along with the deterioration of the housing market  have led to worsening general economic conditions  which have impacted the broader capital and credit markets and have reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular 
in the past  we were able to access the capital and credit markets to finance our investment activities 
however  due to the current turmoil in the debt markets and uncertainty in the equity capital markets  we cannot assure you that debt or equity capital will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
as an example  because our common stock has traded at a price below our current net asset value per share over the last several months and we are not generally able under the act to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
these conditions may limit our ability to grow our investment portfolio 
portfolio composition our primary business is lending to and investing in small to mid sized businesses through investments in senior secured loans  junior secured loans  subordinated debt investments and equity based investments  including warrants 
the fair value of our portfolio excluding unearned income of million and million at december  and  respectively was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the value of our portfolio during each period is primarily attributable to newly originated investments 
total portfolio investment activity excluding unearned income as of the fiscal year ended december  and december   respectively  was as follows december  december  beginning portfolio at fair value investments in debt securities investments in equity securities investment repayments increase in payment in kind interest dividends sale of investments increase decrease in fair value of investments ending portfolio at fair value the level of investment activity for investments funded and principal repayments for our investments can vary substantially from period to period depending on the number and size of investments that we make and many other factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to small to mid sized companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment  and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
as of december  and december   the composition of our portfolio at fair value excluding unearned income was as follows december  december  investments at percentage of investments at percentage of fair value total portfolio fair value total portfolio senior secured revolving lines of credit senior secured term loans junior secured term loans senior subordinated debt investments in equity securities totals for the years ended december  and  the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding debt investments was approximately and  respectively 
yields are computed using actual interest income earned for the respective year  including amortization of loan fees and original issue discount  divided by the weighted average fair value of debt investments 
as of december   million of our portfolio investments at fair value excluding unearned income were at fixed interest rates  which represented approximately of our total portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income 
as of december   million of our portfolio investments at fair value excluding unearned income were at fixed interest rates  which represented approximately of our total portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income 
we generally structure our subordinated debt investments at fixed rates  while many of our senior secured and junior secured loans are  and will be  at variable rates 
in and  we  through our special purpose subsidiary  entered into five interest rate swap agreements 
our swap agreements have a fixed rate range of to on an initial notional amount of million 
the swap agreements expire five years from issuance 
the swaps were put into place to hedge against changes in variable interest payments on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
for the year ended december   net unrealized depreciation attributed to the swaps was approximately  for the year ended december   net unrealized appreciation attributed to the swaps was approximately  while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower rates with respect to the outstanding borrowings 
at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes 
the composition of our investment portfolio by industry sector  using moody s industry classifications  excluding unearned income  as of december  and december  at cost and fair value was as follows december  december  cost fair value cost fair value machinery personal nondurable consumer products electronics automobile health care  education childcare grocery metals minerals printing publishing ecological textiles leather mining  steel  iron nonprecious metals chemicals  plastic rubber retail stores housewares durable consumer products diversified conglomerate service beverage  food tobacco buildings real estate insurance oil gas personal  food miscellaneous services containers  packaging glass aerospace defense total represents percentage of total portfolio 
at december  and december   our two largest investments represented approximately and  respectively  of the total investment portfolio at fair value 
investment income  consisting of interest  dividends  fees  and recognition of gains on equity interests  can fluctuate dramatically upon repayment of an investment or sale of an equity interest 
revenue recognition in any given period can be highly concentrated among several customers 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record investment income from any customer in excess of of total investment income 
during the year ended december   investment income from three customers accounted for   and of our total investment income 
at december  and  our equity investments consisted of common and preferred stock  llc membership interests and warrants to acquire equity interests in certain of our portfolio companies 
warrants to acquire equity interests allow us to participate in the potential appreciation in the value of the portfolio company  while minimizing the amount of upfront cost to us 
asset quality debt portfolio we utilize a standard investment rating system for our entire portfolio of debt investments 
investment rating is used for investments that exceed expectations and or capital gain is expected 
investment rating is used for investments that are generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating is used for performing investments that require closer monitoring 
investment rating is used for investments performing below expectations where a higher risk of loss exists 
investment rating is used for investments performing significantly below expectations where we expect a loss 
the following table shows the distribution of our debt investments on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and december  december  december  debt debt investments at percentage of investments at percentage of investment rating fair value total portfolio fair value total portfolio totals loans and debt securities on non accrual status at december  and  none of our loans or debt securities were on non accrual status 
results of operations the principal measure of our financial performance is net income loss  which includes net investment income loss  net realized gain loss and net unrealized appreciation depreciation 
net investment income loss is the difference between our income from interest  dividends  fees  and other investment income and our operating expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated cost 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on interest rate swaps is the net change in the fair value of our outstanding swap agreements 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
comparison of the year ended december  and december  total investment income total investment income included interest and dividend income on our investments  fee income and other investment income 
fee income consists principally of loan and arrangement fees  annual administrative fees  unused fees  prepayment fees  amendment fees  equity structuring fees and waiver fees 
other investment income consists primarily of the accelerated recognition of deferred financing fees received from our portfolio companies on the repayment of the entire outstanding investment  the sale of the investment or reduction of available credit 
total investment income for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   this amount consisted of interest income of  from cash and cash equivalents  million of interest and dividend income from portfolio investments which included million in payment in kind or pik interest and dividends  million in fee income and  in other investment income 
for the year ended december   this amount primarily consisted of interest income of  from cash and cash equivalents  million of interest and dividend income from portfolio investments which included million in payment in kind or pik interest and dividends   in fee income and  in other investment income 
the increase in our total investment income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the primary reason behind the increase in total investment income was an increase in interest income due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio  and an increase in fee income due to an increase in prepayment penalties and structuring fees as well as higher fees  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield on our investments 
the weighted average yield decreased as a result of a shift in our portfolio mix towards more senior secured investments and an overall decrease in market interest rates 
expenses expenses included compensation expense  interest on our outstanding indebtedness  professional fees  and general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased compensation expense in the amount of million  increased interest expense in the amount of million and increased general and administrative expense in the amount of  those increases were offset by lower professional fees expense in the amount of  the higher compensation expense is due to the increase in salaries of existing employees  higher bonus accruals and the addition of new employees during the year 
we expect to hire additional employees as needed in the future as our investment activities grow 
the higher interest expense is attributable to an increase in the weighted average borrowings outstanding under our million amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility  which were approximately million in as compared to million in  and an increase in interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness during the third and fourth quarters of such borrowings were primarily used to fund investments 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of higher costs for benefits and travel attributable to the increase in employees and computer software expense 
the decrease in professional fees expense is primarily due to decreases in the fees we incurred in related to our initial compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of realized gain loss on sale of investments net realized gain loss on sale of investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated cost 
during the year ended december   we realized gains of  principally due to the sale of equity warrants from one of our portfolio investments 
during the year ended december   we sold our investment in interstate highway sign corporation and realized a net loss of million 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments we determine the value of each investment in our portfolio on a quarterly basis  and changes in value result in unrealized appreciation or depreciation being recognized in our statement of operations 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
at december  and  portfolio investments recorded at fair value net of unearned income were approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make 
we specifically value each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful  or when the enterprise value of the portfolio company does not currently support the cost of our debt or equity investment 
for a discussion about a new accounting pronouncement that could impact how we determine the fair value of our investments and in turn have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting pronouncements 
enterprise value means the entire value of the company to a potential buyer  including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time 
we record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and or our equity security has also appreciated in value 
changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
our process for determining the fair value of our investments begins with determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
there is no one methodology to determine enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
typically in the private equity business  companies are bought and sold based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flow  net income  revenues or  in limited instances  book value 
the private equity industry uses financial measures such as ebitda in order to assess a portfolio company s financial performance and to value a portfolio company 
when using ebitda to determine enterprise value  we may adjust ebitda for non recurring items 
such adjustments are intended to normalize ebitda to reflect the portfolio company s earnings power 
adjustments to ebitda may include compensation to previous owners  acquisition  recapitalization  or restructuring related items or one time non recurring income or expense items 
in determining a multiple to use for valuation purposes  we look to private merger and acquisition statistics  discounted public trading multiples or industry practices 
in estimating a reasonable multiple  we consider not only the fact that our portfolio company may be a private company relative to a peer group of public comparables  but we also consider the size and scope of our portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses 
in some cases  the best valuation methodology may be a discounted cash flow analysis based on future projections 
if a portfolio company is distressed  a liquidation analysis may provide the best indication of enterprise value 
if there is adequate enterprise value to support the repayment of our debt  the fair value of our loan or debt security normally corresponds to cost plus the amortized original issue discount unless the borrower s condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
the fair value of equity interests in portfolio companies is determined based on various factors  including the enterprise value remaining for equity holders after the repayment of the portfolio company s debt and other preference capital  and other pertinent factors such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  or other liquidation events 
the determined fair values of equity securities are generally discounted to account for restrictions on resale and minority ownership positions 
duff phelps  llc  an independent valuation firm duff phelps  provided third party valuation consulting services to us which consisted of certain limited procedures that we engaged them to perform 
at december  and at december   we asked duff phelps to perform the limited procedures on investments in and  respectively  portfolio companies comprising approximately and  respectively  of the total investments at fair value 
upon completion of their limited procedures at december  and  respectively  duff phelps concluded that the fair value of those investments subjected to the limited procedures did not appear to be unreasonable 
our board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains and losses are realized 
during the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million on our investments and during the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized appreciation of million on our investments  which primarily related to one investment which was sold during the year at a realized loss of million 
a substantial portion of the unrealized depreciation recorded during resulted from an increase in the number of our portfolio companies requiring closer monitoring or performing below expectations and  to a lesser extent  from quoted market prices below par on our syndicated loan portfolio as a result of disruption in the financial and credit markets for large syndicated loans 
sustained market disruptions in the large corporate leverage loan market could continue to have a downward impact on the amount of unrealized depreciation we record on our syndicated loans 
unrealized appreciation depreciation on interest rate swaps net unrealized depreciation on interest rate swaps represents the change in value of our swap agreements 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized depreciation of approximately  on our interest rate swap agreements as compared to  in unrealized appreciation in the comparable period in the unrealized depreciation in the value of our interest rate swap agreements resulted from the volatility in interest rates during the year 
net income from operations net income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in net income was primarily a result of an increase in investment income of million in  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in the amount of million in and an increase in net realized and unrealized loss in the amount of million 
comparison of the year ended december  and december  total investment income total investment income included interest and dividend income on our investments  fee income and other investment income 
fee income consists principally of loan and arrangement fees  annual administrative fees  unused fees  prepayment fees  amendment fees  equity structuring fees and waiver fees 
other investment income consists primarily of the accelerated recognition of deferred financing fees received from our portfolio companies on the repayment of the entire outstanding investment  the sale of the investment or reduction of available credit

the increase in our total investment income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  expenses expenses included compensation expense  consulting fees  interest on our outstanding indebtedness  professional fees  a prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the outstanding balance under our million financing agreement  and general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of incurring a million prepayment penalty in from the repayment of the outstanding balance under our million financing agreement and the termination of consulting agreements on july  those decreases were offset by higher compensation expense in the amount of million   of which related to non cash stock option compensation as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  on january   higher interest expense in the amount of  increased professional fees in the amount of  and higher general and administrative expenses in the amount of million 
the higher compensation expense was attributable to the increase in the number of personnel due to increased investment activities and increased bonus accruals primarily due to our entry into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers during the latter part of the year ended december  we expect to hire additional employees as needed in the future as our investment activities grow 
the higher interest expense is attributable to an increase in the borrowings outstanding under our million amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility 
such borrowings are primarily used to fund investments 
the increased professional fees are a result of higher costs attributable to being a public company 
the increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to increases in the following insurance  directors fees  investor relations and franchise taxes 
we incurred consulting fees in the amount of  for the year ended december   payable to two entities affiliated with compass group investments  inc these consulting arrangements were terminated on july  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
realized gain loss on sale of investments net realized gain loss on sale of investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated cost 
during the year ended december   we sold our investment in interstate highway sign corporation and realized a net loss of million

in addition  at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in restricted cash which we maintained in accordance with the terms of our million amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility with an entity affiliated with bmo capital markets corp 
a portion of these funds were released or available to us on january  and january   respectively 
at december   the interest rate on our million amended and restated securitization facility was approximately and there was approximately million outstanding 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the comparable period 
this change was due primarily to an increase in net income  a decrease in interest receivable  an increase in unrealized loss on investments  an increase in unrealized loss on swaps  and an increase in unearned income 
those amounts were offset by a decrease in realized loss on investments  and an increase in pik interest and dividends 
cash used for investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  our primary sources of capital had been from compass group investments  inc which provided us with a million equity investment  a  demand note and a million secured revolving line of credit and an unaffiliated lender which provided us with a line of credit under which we had the ability to borrow up to million  subject to certain conditions 
on august   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and on august   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
we received net proceeds after underwriters commissions  discounts and fees of million 
concurrent with our initial public offering  we entered into a securitization revolving credit facility  which we amended and restated in august see borrowings 
on june   we closed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of million less underwriters commissions and discounts  and fees of million 
also  as part of this public offering  compass group investments  inc sold  shares of our common stock  which resulted in it beneficially owning of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately upon the completion of such offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such shares by compass group investments  inc on january   we closed a shelf offering of  shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of million less underwriters commissions and discounts  and fees of million

although we expect that cash on hand  borrowing availability  and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs at our current level of operations  we may face difficultly in obtaining new debt and equity financing as a result of the current turmoil in the credit markets and uncertainty in the capital markets  which could limit our ability to grow 
in this regard  because our common stock has traded at a price below our current net asset value per share over the last several months and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
see risk factors regulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to  and the way in which we  raise additional capital and because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders in connection with our election to be treated as a ric  we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth 
if additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired for a discussion of the provisions of the act that limit our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share 
in addition  our amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility contains certain requirements  including  but not limited to  minimum diversity  rating and yield  and limitations on loan size 
these requirements may limit our ability to fund certain new originations with advances under the facility 
in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to rics under subchapter m of the code  we intend to continue distributing to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income 
taxable income generally differs from net income loss for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized 
taxable income includes cash fees collected and non cash items  such as pik interest and dividends 
cash collections of income resulting from pik interest and dividends generally occur upon the repayment of the loans or debt securities that include such items and cash collections of income resulting from pik dividends occur upon the sale of the equity securities received in connection therewith 
non cash taxable income is reduced by non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization expense 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulated investment company status and dividends 
in addition  as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
as of december   this ratio was 
to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future  we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources  including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt related markets  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
borrowings securitization revolving credit facility 
on september   we  through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of ours  entered into an amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility the securitization facility  with an entity affiliated with bmo capital markets corp 
formerly harris nesbitt corp on may   we amended our securitization facility and lowered the interest rate payable on any outstanding balances under the securitization facility during the period of time we are permitted to make draws 
the amendment also reduced or eliminated certain restrictions pertaining to certain loan covenants 
on august   we amended the securitization facility and increased its borrowing capacity by million 
the amendment also extended the commitment termination date by an additional day period to july  and also reduced or eliminated certain restrictions pertaining to certain loan covenants 
the securitization facility allows our special purpose subsidiary to borrow up to million million prior to august  through the issuance of notes to a multi seller commercial paper conduit administered by the affiliated entity 
the securitization facility is secured by all of the loans held by our special purpose subsidiary 
the securitization facility bears interest at the commercial paper rate plus prior to may  and allows our special purpose subsidiary to make draws under the securitization facility until july  july  prior to august   unless extended prior to such date for an additional day period with the consent of the lender 
if the securitization facility is not extended  any principal amounts then outstanding will be amortized over a month period following july  and interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings under the facility at the prime rate plus 
the securitization facility provides for the payment to the lender of a monthly fee equal to per annum on the unused amount of the securitization facility 
we can use the proceeds of the securitization facility to fund our loan origination activities and for general corporate purposes 
each loan origination under the securitization facility will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow funds under the securitization facility at any particular time or at all 
as of december   million was outstanding under the securitization facility 
the predecessor securitization revolving credit facility to the securitization facility i allowed our special purpose subsidiary to make draws under the securitization facility until july   unless extended prior to such date for an additional day period with the consent of the lender thereto  ii bore interest at the commercial paper rate plus  iii provided that in the event that the securitization facility was not extended  any principal amounts then outstanding would be amortized over a month period following july  and interest would accrue on outstanding borrowings under the securitization facility at the prime rate plus  and iv contained more stringent restrictions regarding certain loan concentrations 
in and  we  through our special purpose subsidiary  entered into five interest rate swap agreements 
our swap agreements have a fixed rate range of to on an initial notional amount totaling million 
the swap agreements expire five years from issuance 
the swaps were put into place to hedge against changes in variable interest payments on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
for the year ended december   net unrealized depreciation attributed to the swaps was approximately  for the year ended december   net unrealized appreciation attributed to the swaps was approximately  while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower rates with respect to the outstanding borrowings 
at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes 
regulated investment company status and dividends effective as of august   we elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
as long as we qualify as a ric  we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  to stockholders on a timely basis 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  until realized 
dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income  the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year 
distributions also may include returns of capital 
to maintain ric tax treatment  we must  among other things  distribute  with respect to each taxable year  at least of our investment company taxable income ie  our net ordinary income and our realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute  with respect to each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our annual taxable income which includes our taxable interest and fee income 
we currently intend to retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains ie  realized net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders 
if we do this  our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after tax proceeds in our common stock 
our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits or  in certain circumstances  tax refunds equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them 
during the year ended december  and  we realized short term capital gains of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we realized a long term capital gain of  which will be available to be offset against previously recorded capital losses  and during the year ended december   we realized a long term capital loss of million which will be available to offset capital gains until december  to the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal tax year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in our amended and restated securitization credit facility 
if we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our taxable income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
on february   our board of directors authorized a cash dividend of per share  payable on april  to stockholders of record as of the close of business march  such cash dividend will be paid on total shares issued and outstanding on the record date

off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by conducting extensive due diligence  negotiating appropriate financial covenants and obtaining collateral where necessary 
as of december   we had unused commitments to extend credit to our portfolio companies of million  which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
in connection with our amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility  our consolidated special purpose subsidiary may be required under certain circumstances to enter into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging transactions 
we have agreed to guarantee the payment of certain swap breakage costs that may be payable by our special purpose subsidiary in connection with any such interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging transactions 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements outstanding

if the facility is not extended  any principal amounts then outstanding will be amortized over a month period following july  and interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings under the facility at the prime rate plus 
this table assumes that we would repay all of our indebtedness under the facility at the time that we were no longer able to make draws under the facility 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to repay all of such outstanding indebtedness at such time

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation of portfolio investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
our process for determining the fair value of our investments begins with determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
for a discussion on a new accounting pronouncement that may impact how we determine the fair value of our investments  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting pronouncements 
there is no one methodology to determine enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
typically in the private equity business  companies are bought and sold based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flow  net income  revenues or  in limited instances  book value 
the private equity industry uses financial measures such as ebitda in order to assess a portfolio company s financial performance and to value a portfolio company 
when using ebitda to determine enterprise value  we may adjust ebitda for non recurring items 
such adjustments are intended to normalize ebitda to reflect the portfolio company s earnings power 
adjustments to ebitda may include compensation to previous owners  acquisition  recapitalization  or restructuring related items or one time non recurring income or expense items 
in determining a multiple to use for valuation purposes  we look to private merger and acquisition statistics  discounted public trading multiples or industry practices 
in estimating a reasonable multiple  we consider not only the fact that our portfolio company may be a private company relative to a peer group of public comparables  but we also consider the size and scope of our portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses 
in some cases  the best valuation methodology may be a discounted cash flow analysis based on future projections 
if a portfolio company is distressed  a liquidation analysis may provide the best indication of enterprise value 
if there is adequate enterprise value to support the repayment of our debt  the fair value of our loan or debt security normally corresponds to cost plus the amortized original issue discount unless the borrower s condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
the fair value of equity interests in portfolio companies is determined based on various factors  including the enterprise value remaining for equity holders after the repayment of the portfolio company s debt and other preference capital  and other pertinent factors such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  or other liquidation events 
the determined fair values of equity securities are generally discounted to account for restrictions on resale and minority ownership positions 
fee income recognition we receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of our business  including arrangement fees and loan fees 
we account for our fee income in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of a company s accounting for arrangements containing multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables ie  there are separate units of accounting 
eitf states that the total consideration received for the arrangement be allocated to each unit based upon each unit s relative fair value 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
in determining fair value of various fee income we receive  we will first rely on data compiled through our investment and syndication activities and secondly on independent third party data 
the timing of revenue recognition for a given unit of accounting will depend on the nature of the deliverable s in that accounting unit and the corresponding revenue recognition model and whether the general conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
fee income for which fair value cannot be reasonably ascertained is recognized using the interest method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  sfas no 

we have historically recognized fee income in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  we capitalize and offset direct loan origination costs against the origination fees received and only defer the net fee 
payment in kind or pik interest and dividends we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind or pik interest or dividends  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term or contractually deferred dividends added to our equity investment in the portfolio company 
we will cease accruing pik interest if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due  and we will cease accruing pik dividends if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to make pik dividend payments in the future 
in certain cases  a portfolio company makes principal payments on its loan prior to making payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a portfolio company s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that portfolio company may stay the same or decrease 
accrued pik interest and dividends represented million or of our portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income as of december  the net increase in loan and equity balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our statements of cash flows 
pik related activity for the year ended december  was as follows fiscal year ended december  beginning pik balance pik interest and dividends earned during the period pik payments received during the period ending pik balance interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
at december  and  none of our loans or debt securities were greater than days past due or on non accrual status 
at december   although none of our loans and debt securities were greater than days past due  loans and debt securities at fair value totaling million were not accruing pik interest 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the aicpa issued statement of position  clarification of the scope of the audit and accounting guide investment companies and accounting by parent companies and equity method investors for investments in investment companies sop 
sop also provides guidance for determining whether investment company accounting applied by a subsidiary or equity method investee should be retained in the financial statements of the parent company or an equity method investor 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption encouraged 
on february   the fasb deferred the effective date of sop indefinitely 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
sfas no 
allows us to make an irrevocable election to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses on the elected items recognized in earnings at each reporting period 
the fair value option may only be elected at the time of initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability or upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
the election is applied on an instrument by instrument basis  with a few exceptions  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas also provides expanded disclosure requirements regarding the effects of electing the fair value option on the financial statements 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november  although we are currently evaluating sfas  we do not anticipate that adoption will have a significant impact  if any  on our results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
fasb statement no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently analyzing the effect of adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial position  including our net asset value  and results of operations 
we will adopt this statement on a prospective basis for the quarter ending march  adoption of this statement could have an adverse material effect on our consolidated financial statements  including our net asset value 
however  the actual impact on our consolidated financial statements in the period of adoption and subsequent to the period of adoption cannot be determined at this time as it will be influenced by the estimates of fair value for that period and the number and amount of investments we originate  acquire or exit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business activities contain elements of market risk 
we consider interest rates to be our principal market risk 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our business 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
our investment income is affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
approximately of our investment portfolio at fair value bears interest at fixed rates  with the remainder at floating rates 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net investment income 
our interest rates on our borrowings are based on commercial paper rates 
we have and may continue to use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected investment income by approximately million and interest expense by approximately million 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
