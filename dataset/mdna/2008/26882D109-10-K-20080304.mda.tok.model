item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
management s overview electronic discovery segment our electronic discovery business provides processing and search and review services to companies and the litigation departments of law firms 
our edatamatrix software analyzes  filters  deduplicates and produces documents for review 
produced documents are made available primarily through our hosted website  and our documatrix software allows for efficient plaintiff and defendant counsel review and data requests 
our customers are typically large corporations that use our products and services cooperatively with their legal counsel to manage the electronic discovery process for complex litigation matters 
the substantial increase of electronic documents by businesses has changed the dynamics of how attorneys support discovery in complex litigation matters 
according to the socha gelbmann electronic discovery survey  the domestic commercial electronic discovery revenues were estimated at billion  an approximate increase from according to this same source  the market is expected to continue to grow at year over year annual rates of for  for and for due to the complexity of cases  the volume of data that are maintained electronically  and the volume of documents that are produced in all types of litigation  we anticipate that law firms will become increasingly reliant on electronic evidence management systems to organize and manage the litigation discovery process 
significant sources of revenue include fees related to the conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies primarily on the size number of documents and complexity of the engagement  and hosting fees based on the amount of data stored 
bankruptcy trustee segment our bankruptcy trustee business addresses the needs of chapter and chapter bankruptcy trustees 
chapter is a liquidation bankruptcy for individuals or businesses that  as measured by the number of new cases filed in fiscal year  accounted for approximately of all bankruptcy filings 
in a chapter case  the debtor s assets are liquidated and the resulting cash proceeds are used by the chapter bankruptcy trustee to pay creditors 
chapter cases typically last several years 
chapter is a reorganization model of bankruptcy for individuals that  as measured by the number of new cases filed in fiscal year  accounted for approximately of all bankruptcy filings 
in a chapter case  debtors make periodic cash payments into a reorganization plan and a chapter bankruptcy trustee uses these cash payments to make monthly distributions to creditors 
chapter cases typically last several years 
the participants in these bankruptcy proceedings include the debtor  the debtor s counsel  the creditors  the bankruptcy judge  and the professional bankruptcy trustee 
our end user customers are professional bankruptcy trustees 
the executive office for united states trustees  a division of the us department of justice  appoints all bankruptcy trustees 
a united states trustee is appointed in most federal court districts and generally has responsibility for overseeing the integrity of the bankruptcy system 
the bankruptcy trustee s primary responsibilities include liquidating the debtor s assets or collecting funds from the debtor  distributing the collected funds to creditors pursuant to the orders of the bankruptcy court and preparing regular status reports for the executive office for united states trustees and for the bankruptcy court 
trustees manage an entire caseload of bankruptcy cases simultaneously 
the application of chapter bankruptcy regulations has the practical effect of discouraging trustee customers from incurring direct administrative costs for computer system expenses 
as a result  we have developed marketing arrangements with various financial institutions under which we provide the bankruptcy trustee case management software and related services and the financial institution provides the bankruptcy trustee with deposit related banking services 
the bankruptcy trustee segment s primary source of revenue is deposit based fees  earned primarily as a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support pcs services  as well as the number of cases managed by a chapter bankruptcy trustee 
the fees we earn based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
settlements and claims segment our settlements and claims segment supports the administration of complex legal proceedings that involve notification of a class of claimants or creditors and the administration of funds related to settlement with the class of claimants or creditors for chapter bankruptcies and class action and mass tort lawsuits 
chapter is a reorganization model of bankruptcy for corporations that  as measured by the number of new cases filed in fiscal year  accounted for approximately of all bankruptcy filings 
chapter generally allows a company  often referred to as the debtor in possession  to continue operating under a plan of reorganization to restructure its business and to modify payment terms of both secured and unsecured obligations 
chapter cases typically last several years 
class action and mass tort refer to litigation in which class representatives bring a lawsuit against a defendant company or other persons on behalf of a large group of similarly affected persons the class 
mass tort refers to class action cases that are particularly large or prominent 
the class action and mass tort marketplace is significant  with estimated annual tort claim costs of approximately billion in  according to a study issued in by towers perrin 
administrative costs  which include costs  other than defense costs  incurred by either the insurance company or self insured entity in the administration of claims  comprise approximately of this total 
key participants in this marketplace include law firms that specialize in representing class action and mass tort plaintiffs and other law firms that specialize in representing defendants 
our customers are companies that are administering the settlement or resolution of class action cases and debtor corporations that have filed a plan of reorganization 
we sell our services directly to those customers  however  our relationships with other interested parties  including legal counsel  often provide access to these customers 
significant sources of revenue include fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  and controlled disbursements 
the amount we earn varies primarily on the size and complexity of the engagement  legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including direct notification and media campaign and advertising management  in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement  and reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  business combinations  goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  income taxes and derivative financial instruments to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition 
we provide two groups or classes of services case management services and document management services 
case management solutions provide clients with integrated technology based products and services for the automation of various administrative tasks 
document management solutions include proprietary technology and production services to ensure timely  accurate and complete execution of the many documents associated with multi faceted legal cases and communications applications 
significant sources of revenue include fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services defined by client contracts  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  and conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies based primarily on the size and complexity of the engagement  hosting fees based on the amount of data stored  deposit based fees from financial institutions  primarily based on a percentage of total liquidated assets placed on deposit at that financial institution by our bankruptcy trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support pcs services  legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including direct notification and media campaign and advertising management in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement  and reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
non software arrangements services related to electronic discovery and settlements and claims are billed based on volume and are evaluated pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for these contractual arrangements  we have identified the following deliverable services electronic discovery data processing hosting settlements and claims consulting claims administration printing and mailing document management notice campaigns toll free customer support web site design hosting based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting under eitf we allocate revenue to the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition sab topic 
as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
if we are unable to establish the fair value of each element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services  we may not be able to recognize revenue for services until the contract is complete  which would likely have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support pcs services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the dollar level of average monthly deposits placed by the trustees with that financial institution  from the financial institution related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and pcs services 
we account for the software license and pcs elements in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered element  which is pcs 
this revenue  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
revenue related to pcs is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue consistent with the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid tpa  fair value in multiple element arrangements that include contingent usage based fees and software revenue recognition as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectability is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria contained in sop  since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if our contractual arrangements were to change  we may not be able to recognize revenue until the contract was complete or substantially complete  which would likely have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware  such as desktop computers  monitors  and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and  based on guidance provided in eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals under eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent rent and sab topic  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieved our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
reimbursements we have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily postage 
consistent with guidance provided by eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statements of operations as operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs and as reimbursed direct costs 
share based compensation 
effective january   we have accounted for share based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  during the years ended december  and we recognized expense related to share options issued prior to but unvested as of january  as well as expense related to share options issued subsequent to january  for share options issued after january   the share options were also valued using the black scholes option valuation model 
key assumptions for the black scholes option valuation model include expected volatility  expected term of share options granted  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 
we estimate our expected volatility based on implied volatilities from traded share options on our stock and on our stock s historical volatility 
we have estimated the expected term of our share options based on the historical exercise pattern of groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of the award 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas r  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material affect on our direct cost of services and general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material affect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of sfas no 
r affects the classification within our consolidated statement of cash flows of certain tax benefits as certain tax benefits formerly classified as an operating cash flow are now classified as a financing cash flow 
to date  the only share based compensation we have issued is share options 
for additional information related to our adoption of sfas no 
r  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from two to fourteen years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill 
we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment as of each july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
for each reporting unit  the fair value estimate for our annual assessment was consistent with the fair value estimate as of january   the date at which we revised the structure of our operating segments 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment related to the estimate of the magnitude and timing of future reporting unit cash flows 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  identifiable intangible assets 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  information developed during our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the identifiable intangible asset s carrying value and would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  income taxes 
a deferred tax asset or liability recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of our tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that sufficient future taxable income  taking into consideration tax planning strategies  may not generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize net deferred tax assets  we may be required to establish or increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 
this charge may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the recognition of a change in enacted tax rates may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense and on our consolidated statements of operations 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standard board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
application of fin requires numerous estimates based on available information 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  and our recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
as we obtain additional information  we may need to periodically adjust our recognized tax positions and tax benefits 
these periodic adjustments may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin was reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of january  the cumulative effect adjustment does not include items that would not be recognized in earnings  such as the effect on tax positions related to business combinations 
for additional information related to our adoption of fin  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
for a derivative instrument not designated as an accounting hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
in august of  we purchased interest rate floor options with a notional value of million  and these instruments were not designated as accounting hedges 
the interest rate floor options were purchased in negotiated transactions 
as a result  we cannot determine the fair value of the interest rate floor options based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
instead  as of each period end we estimate the fair value of the interest rate floor options based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and based on inputs other than quoted prices  primarily interest rates and yield curves  which are observable 
changes in these estimates  included as a component of other operating expenses  may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
if the one month libor increased by basis points  we estimate the effect would be to decrease income before taxes by approximately million and that there would be no effect on our cash flow 
if the one month libor decreased by basis points  we estimate the effect would be to increase income before taxes by approximately million and that there would be no effect on our cash flow 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenue total revenue from operations of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate million  or  decrease compared with million of revenue for the prior year 
total revenue includes operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs  which are presented as a separate line item captioned operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs on our consolidated statements of operations 
while operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income loss from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  also presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations  decreased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of an approximate million decrease in bankruptcy trustee revenue before reimbursed direct costs and an approximate million decrease in settlements and claims revenue before reimbursed direct costs  partly offset by an approximate million increase in electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs 
as more fully explained under the caption significant accounting policies revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements  the decrease in bankruptcy trustee operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs is primarily attributable to the recognition during  of approximately million of revenue  deferred beginning in october  following delivery of the final specified software upgrade pursuant to a specific arrangement that expired september  all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services decreased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in legal noticing expense combined with a million decrease in outside services  partly offset by a million increase in compensation related expense and a million increase in rent expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 
direct cost of bundled products and services decreased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year primarily as a result of decreased compensation expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 
reimbursed direct costs decreased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease directly corresponds to the decrease in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation expense  primarily due to additional staffing to support growth in our electronic discovery business  combined with a million increase in bonus expense  as well as an approximate million increase in travel expenses and an approximate million increase in rent expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 
depreciation and software and leasehold amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from an increase of approximately million in depreciation and amortization expense related to purchased and internally developed software and the related hardware primarily required to support the expansion of our electronic discovery business 
amortization of intangibles decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  primarily as certain customer contract intangibles  primarily related to our settlements and claims business  and certain trade name intangibles  primarily related to our electronic discovery business  became fully amortized in other operating expenses  which include the mark to market adjustment for the purchased interest rate floor options as well as acquisition related expenses  reflect million of income for the year ended december  compared with million of expense for the prior year 
a portion of our bankruptcy trustee pricing is tied to short term interest rates  and an increase or decrease in the short term interest rate may result in corresponding changes in bankruptcy trustee revenue 
to mitigate our interest rate risk  during the third quarter of  we purchased libor based interest rate floors with strike prices ranging from to and a notional value of million 
these instruments were not designated as accounting hedges 
at the end of each period  we estimate the fair value of these instruments and the change in market value is recognized as a component of other operating expenses 
the adjustment for the year ended december  resulted in the recognition of million of income 
subsequent to december   we terminated these interest rate floor options and received cash of approximately million 
we did not recognize any acquisition related expenses during the year ended december  compared with million recognized for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to a million decrease in interest expense related to our credit facility and a million decrease in the amortization of loan fees  partly offset by a million increase in net expense related to the holders right to extend the maturity of the notes by up to three years 
the decrease in interest expense related to our credit facility is primarily due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings from approximately million as of the beginning of to approximately million as of september  in november  we used proceeds from a registered offering of our common shares to repay the credit facility in full 
loan amortization expense decreased as the fees related to our contingent convertible subordinated notes became fully amortized during june during april  the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to extend the maturity of the convertible notes from june to june as a result  we will continue to pay interest  at a rate of per annum  during the extension period on any notes that remain outstanding the holders of the notes may chose at any time to convert some or all of the notes into our common shares see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conversion right 
we estimated the fair value of the option immediately prior to the note holders vote to extend and recorded a final adjustment to the fair value of the option to extend the notes maturity 
this final adjustment was recorded as a charge to interest expense  resulting in an estimated fair value expense of million during compared to an estimated fair value expense of million during we are currently amortizing the exercise date fair value of the option as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the extension  which partly offsets the increase to interest expense related to recognition of the estimated fair value of the right to extend the maturity of the contingent convertible subordinated notes 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared with an effective rate of for the prior year 
our tax rate is generally higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
several of our subsidiaries operate in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily due to the reversal of valuation allowance related to our united kingdom net operating loss carryforward 
prior to  we established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net operating loss carryforward asset 
the subsidiary generated taxable income in and we utilized a portion of the net operating loss carryforward 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the net operating loss would be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to the remaining net operating loss carryforward asset 
net income loss we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this change is primarily the result of a million decrease in operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs and an million increase in general and administrative expense  partly offset by a million decrease in direct costs and an million decrease in tax expense  all for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the decrease in operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs is primarily the result of a million decrease in bankruptcy trustee operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  largely attributable to the recognition during of revenue which was deferred beginning in october as more fully explained under the business segments bankruptcy trustee segment caption below  and a million decrease in settlements and claims operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  largely the result of a decrease in legal notification revenue  partly offset by a million increase in electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a million increase in compensation related expenses  largely attributable to additional staffing  primarily to support growth in our electronic discovery business  and an increase in bonus expense 
the decrease in direct costs is primarily the result of a million decrease in legal notification costs  largely attributable to the decline in legal noticing revenue  and a million decrease in outside services 
the decrease in tax expense is primarily the result of the recognition of previously deferred bankruptcy trustee revenue during business segments the following management discussion and analysis is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
electronic discovery segment electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to projects from existing clients as well as an expansion of our client base 
hosting and processing services accounted for approximately million of this increase  the remainder of the increase is related to ancillary professional services provided to our clients 
electronic discovery direct costs and general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase during the year ended december  compared with the prior year is primarily due to expanded staffing and increased sales related commissions  resulting in a million increase in compensation related expenses  million of expense related to the relocation and expansion of our data center facilities  an increase in equipment and software maintenance and rent expense of million  and an increase in relocation expense and travel related expenses of million 
bankruptcy trustee segment bankruptcy trustee operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs decreased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
as more fully explained under the caption significant accounting policies  revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements  this decrease is primarily the result of our revenue recognition related to a specific arrangement in with our primary depository financial institution 
during the second quarter of  we delivered the final software upgrade specified under this arrangement 
as the only remaining undelivered element was pcs services and as the contract terminated september   during we recognized  in accordance with sop  million of revenue that had been deferred during the period october  through december  effective october   we entered into a new arrangement with this depository financial institution  this new arrangement does not include provisions related to software upgrades 
accordingly  we now recognize this revenue based on a contingent usage based revenue model and  during the year ended december  we did not defer any bankruptcy trustee revenue or recognize any previously deferred bankruptcy trustee revenue 
the remaining decrease of approximately million in bankruptcy trustee operating revenue before reimbursed is primarily attributable to a decline in average trustee deposits during compared with as a result of the decrease in bankruptcy filings during and bankruptcy trustee direct costs and general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  reflecting a bankruptcy trustee operating cost structure for that was consistent with the prior year s cost structure 
settlements and claims segment settlements and claims operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is the result of a million decrease in document management revenue partly offset by a million increase in case management revenue 
requirements in cases and the size of cases will vary from period to period creating variations in both document management and case management services 
the decrease in document management revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in legal noticing requirements compared with the prior year 
the increase in case management revenue is primarily the result of increased requirements and size of cases compared to the prior year  resulting in a million increase in professional fees 
settlement and claims direct costs and general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a million reduction in the cost of legal noticing  a million decrease in outside services  and a million decrease in reimbursed direct costs  partly offset by a million increase in compensation related expenses 
legal noticing expense generally fluctuates directly with legal noticing revenue and outside services costs will vary depending on the timing of cases and the specific services required by the client 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  to enhance comparability of the results for the year ended december  to the prior year  we separately identify the operating results of recently acquired entities  nmatrix  hilsoft  and epiq advisory services collectively  the recently acquired entities  which were not included in our operating results for all or a substantial portion of the prior year 
revenue total revenue from operations of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate million  or  increase compared with million of revenue for the prior year 
total revenue includes operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs  which are presented as a separate line item captioned operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs on our consolidated statements of operations 
while operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income loss from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  also presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of an approximate million increase in bankruptcy trustee revenue before reimbursed direct costs  an approximate million increase in settlements and claims revenue before reimbursed direct costs  and an approximate million increase in electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services increased approximately million  or to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an approximate million increase in direct costs of services related to our recently acquired entities 
changes by segment are discussed below 
direct cost of bundled products and services increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year primarily as a result of increased compensation costs 
changes by segment are discussed below 
reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase directly corresponds to the increase in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to our recently acquired entities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the combination of a million increase in compensation expense  primarily related to the recognition of share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r  and increases in administrative expenses to support the expansion of our business  including an approximate million increase in travel and promotional expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 
depreciation and software and leasehold amortization expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  primarily as a result of an approximate million increase related to our recently acquired entities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of a million increase in internally developed software amortization due to our ongoing investment in software development 
amortization of intangibles increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  primarily related to an increase in identifiable intangible assets related to our recently acquired entities 
other operating expenses for both years consisted entirely of acquisition related expenses 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  result from non capitalized expenses for bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense interest expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared with million of interest expense for the prior year 
this increase primarily relates to an approximate million increase in interest expense related to our credit facility  primarily as a result of an increase in borrowings to finance our november electronic discovery acquisition 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate to record tax expense was for the year ended december  compared with an effective rate to record the tax benefit related to our net loss of for the prior year 
our tax rate is generally higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
several of our subsidiaries operate in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
the change in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year s benefit is primarily the result of the effect of nondeductible expenses on pre tax income in versus a pre tax loss in net income loss we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of million for the prior year 
this change is primarily the result of an million increase in revenue from case management bundled products and services  partly offset by million in tax expense for the year ended december  compared with a tax benefit of million for the prior year  a million increase in depreciation and software and intangible asset amortization expenses  a million increase in interest expense  and a million increase in share based compensation expense 
the increase in case management bundled revenue  as more fully explained under the bankruptcy trustee segment caption below  primarily related to the recognition during of revenue which was deferred beginning in october the change in tax expense is largely the result the recognition of income during compared with a loss during the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and software and intangible asset amortization expense is largely attributable to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired by acquisition during the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of additional bank debt incurred to finance these acquisitions 
the increase in share based compensation expense resulted from the adoption as of january   of the sfas r  which resulted in recognition of expense related to issued and unvested stock options 
business segments the following management discussion and analysis is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
electronic discovery segment we entered the electronic discovery market through our acquisition of nmatrix on november   and nmatrix has been included in our results of operations since that date 
electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the year ended december  compared with the inclusion of less than two months of operating results for the year ended december  electronic discovery direct costs and general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the year ended december  compared with the inclusion of less than two months of operating results for the year ended december  bankruptcy trustee segment bankruptcy trustee operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to an million increase in revenue from case management bundled products and services 
this increase primarily relates to an arrangement which began october  and ended september  as of december   we had deferred recognition of million in revenue pending delivery of a final specified software upgrade under the contract provisions 
as a result of this final delivery  we recognized the million of previously deferred revenue during additionally  we recognized  through the end of the arrangement  revenue for bundled software license  software upgrades and postcontract customer support services delivered during we also recognized revenue related to software licenses and postcontract customer support services delivered under a new arrangement  which commenced october  bankruptcy trustee direct costs and general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  reflecting a bankruptcy trustee operating cost structure for that was consistent with the prior year s cost structure 
settlements and claims segment settlements and claims operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an million increase in legal noticing revenue  primarily due to the inclusion of hilsoft operating results for the entire year compared with inclusion of only two months operating results for the prior year  partially offset by a decline in direct noticing revenue and professional fees primarily as a result of fewer class action retentions 
settlement and claims direct costs and general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in legal noticing expense  primarily due to the inclusion of hilsoft operating results for the entire year compared with inclusion of only two months operating results for the prior year  combined with a million increase in outside services costs and a million increase in reimbursable direct costs 
legal noticing expense generally fluctuates directly with legal noticing revenue and outside services costs will vary depending on the timing of cases and the specific services required by the client 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   our operating activities provided net cash of million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities was net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash charges and credits  primarily depreciation and amortization expense of million and share based compensation of million  and cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the most significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a million source of cash related to income taxes  net of the excess tax benefit related to share based compensation  and a million source of cash related to accounts payable and other liabilities  partly offset by a million use of cash related to prepaid expenses and other assets and a million use of cash related to trade accounts receivable 
the source or use of cash related to income taxes will fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of estimated tax payments  the receipt of refunds due  and the amount of our deduction related to the exercise of employee stock options 
the source or use of cash related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities will fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of payments made and the amount of accrued bonus and other compensation 
for the year ended december   the source of cash related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily from an increase in accrued compensation  partly offset by decreases in accrued professional fees  accrued interest  and accounts payable 
the use of cash related to prepaid expense and other assets is primarily related to the purchase of interest rate option floors during trade accounts receivable will fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of collections 
investing activities during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to purchase property  equipment and third party software 
our property  equipment and third party software purchases consisted primarily of computer related hardware  purchased software  and leasehold improvements to support the expansion of our electronic discovery business 
enhancements to our existing software and development of new software used cash of approximately million to fund internal costs related to development of software for which technological feasibility has been established 
we believe that cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated property  equipment and software spending over the next year 
financing activities during the year ended december   we paid in full our credit facility  using approximately million of cash from operations and approximately million from proceeds received pursuant to an equity offering 
during the year  we also paid million as a principal reduction on deferred acquisition price  and we paid million due on capital leases 
financing sources of cash consisted primarily of million of net proceeds from a million common share equity offering and million of net proceeds from stock issued in connection with the exercise of employee share options 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we also classify a portion of the tax benefit  referred to as excess tax benefit  that we realize on exercise of employee share options as a financing cash flow 
the effect of this accounting change was to recognize million of excess tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million including the carrying value of the embedded option from the contingent convertible subordinated notes  which bears interest at based on the million principal amount  and approximately million of obligations related to capitalized leases and deferred acquisition price 
during  the term of our contingent convertible subordinated notes was extended to june the notes will require the use of million of cash at the extended maturity date if the note holders do not convert the notes into shares of our common stock 
the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes have the right to convert at a price of approximately per share 
if any or all notes are converted into shares of our common stock prior to the scheduled maturity of those notes  then there will be no cash requirements associated with those converted notes  other than the regular payment of interest earned prior to the conversion date 
as of december  we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our million senior revolving loan 
we have the right to borrow against the senior revolving loan until it matures in november during the term of the credit facility  we have the right  subject to compliance with our covenants  to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
interest on the credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points  over the libor rate 
as of december   significant financial covenants  all as defined within our credit facility agreement  include a leverage ratio not to exceed to  a senior leverage ratio not to exceed to  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and a current ratio of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our credit facility  including all financial covenants 
we may pursue acquisitions in the future 
covenants contained in our credit facility and in our contingent convertible subordinated notes may limit our ability to consummate an acquisition 
pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  we generally cannot incur indebtedness outside the credit facility with the exception of capital leases and additional subordinated debt  with a limit of million of aggregate subordinated debt 
furthermore  for any acquisition we must be able to demonstrate that  on a pro forma basis  we would be in compliance with our covenants during the four quarters prior to the acquisition and we must obtain bank permission for any acquisition for which cash consideration exceeds million or total consideration exceeds million 
our current credit facility matures in november given our ability to obtain financing in the past  our historical cash flows from operations  and our banking relationships  we anticipate that  if necessary  we will be able to establish a new credit facility on commercially reasonable terms 
we believe that the funds generated from operations plus our existing cash resources and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient over the next months  and for the foreseeable future thereafter  to finance currently anticipated working capital requirements  internal software development expenditures  property  equipment and third party software expenditures  deferred acquisition price agreements and capital leases  interest payments due on our outstanding borrowings  and payments for other contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements although we generally do not utilize off balance sheet arrangements in our operations  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
our operating lease obligations are disclosed below under contractual obligations and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years long term obligations and future accretion   interest payments    employment agreements    capital lease obligations  operating leases      total      approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits are not included in this contractual obligations table due to the uncertainty related to the timing of any payments 
convertible debt is included at stated value of the principal redemption and excludes the carrying value of the embedded option  which will not be paid in cash 
the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes have the right to convert at a price of approximately per share 
any conversion to our common stock of part or all of the convertible debt will reduce our cash obligation related to the convertible debt 
a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions was paid in the form of non interest bearing notes or below market rate notes  which were discounted using an appropriate imputed rate 
the discounts are accreted over the life of the note and each period s accretion is added to the principal of the respective note 
the amount in the above contractual obligation table includes both the notes principal  as reflected on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and all future accretion 
represents payments on fixed interest debt and assumes all contingent convertible subordinate notes are held to the extended maturity date 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we have entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of the acquired companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
during the third quarter of  we purchased three year interest rate floor options  referenced to one month libor and with various strike prices  with a notional value of million 
our interest rate floor options create a market risk for us 
as of december   the interest floor options had an estimated fair value of million 
if the one month libor increased by basis points  we estimate the effect would be to decrease income before taxes by approximately million 
if the one month libor decreased by basis points  we estimate the effect would be to increase income before income taxes by approximately million 
these estimated changes in income before income taxes would not affect our cash flows 
we do not actively manage the market risk related to these instruments
