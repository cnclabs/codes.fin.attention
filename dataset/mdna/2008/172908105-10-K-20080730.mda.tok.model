results of operations fiscal marked the th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas 
this milestone was achieved despite challenging economic conditions  including significant increases in energy costs 
additionally  we increased our dividends paid to shareholders by 
cintas historically classified its businesses into two operating segments  rentals and other services 
the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments  mats  mops and shop towels 
in addition to these rental items  restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment 
effective june   this operating segment was renamed rental uniforms and ancillary products 
the other services operating segment historically consisted of the direct sale of uniforms and related items  first aid  safety and fire protection products and services  document management services and branded promotional products 
effective june   the other services operating segment was separated into three reportable operating segments uniform direct sales operating segment  first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment and document management services operating segment 
this change provides more visibility to these operating segments as they continue to grow and have a larger impact on cintas consolidated results 
the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products 
the first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid  safety and fire protection products and services 
the document management services operating segment consists of document shredding and document storage services

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by operating segment and in total for the periods indicated 
fiscal and fiscal amounts have been restated to reflect the change to the reportable operating segments made effective june  revenue rental uniforms and ancillary products uniform direct sales first aid  safety and fire protection services document management services total revenue cost of sales rental uniforms and ancillary products uniform direct sales first aid  safety and fire protection services document management services total cost of sales gross margin rental uniforms and ancillary products uniform direct sales first aid  safety and fire protection services document management services total gross margin selling and administrative expenses interest income interest expense income before income taxes as shown above  our first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment revenue and document management services operating segment revenue have grown as a percentage of our total revenue over the last two fiscal years 
this shift was driven by acquisitions of first aid  safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 
information related to acquisitions is discussed in note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the continued development of our sales efforts in the first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment and the document management services operating segment have contributed to higher revenue growth in these two operating segments compared to the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the uniform direct sales operating segment 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased over the last two fiscal years primarily due to a reorganization of our sales efforts which began in fiscal the financial impact of this reorganization effort continued into fiscal the reorganization has been completed  and we expect to see improved leverage in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal total revenue was billion  an increase of over fiscal internal growth was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the deterioration in the north american economy created a challenging environment throughout fiscal the rising unemployment in the us put pressure on our ability to grow rental uniform wearers  particularly in the latter half of fiscal  as many of our customers reduced their workforces 
in addition  our fire protection services business within the first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment suffered due to pressure on fire installation system revenue and lower than anticipated recurring service revenue 
our internal growth was generated primarily through the sale of document management services to new and existing customers  continued penetration of our ancillary products and services such as mats  hygiene supplies and restroom cleaning services to existing customers  and first aid and safety products and services to new and existing customers 
the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental  first aid  safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses

while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs  cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs  primarily for water treatment and waste removal  on a regular basis 
environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material non compliance with environmental laws 
new accounting standards as of june   cintas adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fas  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  cintas recorded a decrease to retained earnings as of june   of  cintas adoption of fin is more fully described in note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
cintas will adopt fas in the first quarter of fiscal in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
which delayed the effective date of fas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the adoption of fas for our financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
under fas r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
for cintas  fas r is effective for acquisitions and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after may  cintas is currently evaluating the future impact and disclosures under fas r 
critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue  which is recorded in the rentals uniforms and ancillary products operating segment  is recognized when services are performed 
other services revenue  which is recorded in the uniform direct sales  first aid  safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments  is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market 
an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of months 
other rental items including shop towels  mats  cleanroom garments  flame resistant garments  linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from to months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is typically to years for buildings  to years for building improvements  to years for equipment and to years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less estimated costs related to disposition 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas performs annual impairment tests by operating segment 
these tests include comparisons to current market values  where available  and discounted cash flow analyses 
significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth 
based on the results of the impairment tests  cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally to years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification 
no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may   or stock based compensation as required under fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments to employees  including stock options  in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
measured compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related share based compensation award 
see note entitled stock based compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
please reference note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 
outlook while it is our view that economic conditions will remain sluggish  we believe we can achieve continued growth in sales and profits 
we will pursue our strategy of achieving revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments and markets to which cintas has not historically served 
when appropriate opportunities arise  we will also supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our employee partners and supported by our infrastructure  quality products  financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success 
as such  we see upside revenue potential for all of our business units 
however  we do not expect that economic and competitive pressures will diminish  and these pressures will continue creating a difficult pricing environment 
like many other companies  we anticipate upward pressures on energy costs to remain in fiscal this pressure may make gross margin improvements as a percentage of revenue difficult 
however  we expect productivity improvements brought on by cost containment initiatives  technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure to soften the adverse energy impact 
although difficult to predict  we expect to make improvements to our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal the reorganization of our sales efforts has been completed  and we expect to gain improved leverage from this organization in fiscal we also expect cost containment initiatives will offset anticipated increases to wages and benefits  including medical expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of commercial paper of approximately million  with an average interest rate of 
this exposure is limited by the investment in marketable securities  which act as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
if short term rates change by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 
through its foreign operations  cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar 
cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements
