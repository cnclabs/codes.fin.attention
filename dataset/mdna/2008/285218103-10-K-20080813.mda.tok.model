item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
information appearing under the above caption in our annual report is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates 
while we have the ability to draw on our revolving credit line  we have not had any borrowings under that credit facility for several years 
market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as derivatives and other financial instruments 
at may   and we had not used any derivatives to alter our interest rate risk profile 
at may   our market sensitive instruments totaled million  at cost  in auction rate securities ars  which we classify as investments as a result of the failure of the dutch auction process that provided liquidity 
while we earn interest on our ars based on formulas tied to specified interest rate indexes  the estimated market value for our ars using quotes received from our broker which are derived from their internally developed model no longer approximate the original purchase value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an unrealized loss of million on our ars in the shareholders equity section of our balance 
table of contents sheet 
in determining a fair value for each of our ars  the model weights various factors  including assessments of credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  portfolio composition  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and comparable securities  if any 
accordingly  while fluctuations in interest rates would be expected to impact the unrealized loss of our ars  the exact impact is not easily calculable  since any changes can impact both the cash paid by our ars and the yield on other market instruments  which have opposing impact on the value of our ars 
in addition to those effects on our balance sheet  fluctuations in interest rates can also affect the income we earn on our cash and equivalents and our investments  and can indirectly influence our leasing yields  which correlate with market interest rates when interest rates are higher  our leasing terms incorporate a higher financing charge 
however  in times of relatively lower interest rates our financing charges also decrease  and some of our customers choose to purchase new equipment  rather than leasing equipment at all 
lower leasing yields are reflected in lower rental and lease revenues 
changes in foreign currencies 
we have wholly owned chinese and european subsidiaries 
our international operations subject us to foreign currency risks ie  the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal  we included  of net foreign currency transaction gains in consolidated net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
although there can be no assurances  given the extent of our international operations  we do not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant
