effective january   we began reporting and managing the operations of the eft processing segment and the former software solutions segment on a combined basis 
additionally  as a result of the acquisition of ria in april  we added the money transfer segment 
previously reported amounts have been adjusted to reflect these changes  which did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these changes  we operate in the following three principal business segments 
an eft processing segment  which processes transactions for a network of  atms and approximately  pos terminals across europe  asia and the middle east 
we provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm and pos management solutions  credit and debit card outsourcing and electronic recharge services for prepaid mobile airtime 
through this segment  we also offer a suite of integrated eft software solutions for electronic payment  merchant acquiring  card issuing and transaction delivery systems 
a prepaid processing segment  which provides distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products and collection services for various prepaid products  cards and services 
including terminals operated by unconsolidated subsidiaries  we operate a network of approximately  pos terminals providing electronic processing of prepaid mobile airtime top up services in the us  europe  africa  asia pacific and the middle east 
a money transfer segment  which provides global money transfer and bill payment services through a sending network of agents and company owned stores primarily in north america  the caribbean  europe and asia pacific  disbursing money transfers through a worldwide payer network 
bill payment services are offered primarily in the us the money transfer segment originates and terminates transactions through a network of more than  locations  which include sending agents and company owned stores  and an extensive payer network across countries 
we have six processing centers in europe  two in asia and two in the us we have principal offices in europe  five in the asia pacific region  three in the us and one each in the middle east and latin america 
our executive offices are located in leawood  kansas  usa 
with approximately of our revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  any significant changes in currency exchange rates will likely have a significant impact on our growth in revenues  operating income and diluted earnings per share for more discussion  see item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees and commissions  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s sources of revenue are described below 
eft processing segment revenue in the eft processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from fees charged for transactions effected by cardholders on our proprietary network of atms  as well as fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to banks for operating atms and processing credit cards under outsourcing agreements 
through our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions i cash withdrawals  ii balance inquiries  iii transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization  and iv prepaid telecommunication recharges 
revenue in this segment is also derived from license fees  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
prepaid processing segment revenue in the prepaid processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived from commissions or processing fees received from telecommunications service providers for the sale and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime 
we also generate revenue from commissions earned from the distribution of other prepaid products 
due to certain provisions in our mobile phone operator agreements  the operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our agreements with retailers distributors where pos terminals are located in certain markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by us because we are able to pass a significant portion of the reductions to retailers 
accordingly  under certain retailer agreements  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact on gross margin and operating income 
in some markets  reductions in commissions can significantly impact our results as it may not be possible  either contractually or commercially in the concerned market  to pass a reduction in commissions to the retailers 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates  which also limits our ability to pass through reductions in commissions 
agreements with mobile operators are important to the success of our business 
these agreements permit us to distribute prepaid mobile airtime to the mobile operators customers 
other products offered by this segment include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans  prepaid debit cards  prepaid gift cards and prepaid mobile content such as ring tones and games 
money transfer segment revenue in the money transfer segment  which represents approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived through the charging of a transaction fee  as well as the difference between purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
we have an origination network in place comprised of agents and company owned stores primarily in north america  the caribbean  europe and asia pacific and a worldwide network of distribution agents  consisting primarily of financial institutions in the transfer destination countries 
origination and distribution agents each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services 
these fees are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale 
opportunities and challenges our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on five primary areas outsourced atm and pos terminal management contracts  transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms  our prepaid mobile airtime top up processing services  our money transfer and bill payment services  and development of our credit and debit card outsourcing business 
eft processing segment the continued expansion and development of our eft processing segment business will depend on various factors including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the impact of competition by banks and other atm operators and service providers in our current target markets  the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets  the ability to develop products or services to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our various business lines in markets where we operate and in new markets  the entrance into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain required licenses in markets we intend to enter or expand services  the availability of financing for expansion  the ability to efficiently install atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements  the successful entry into the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  the successful entry into the card issuing and outsourcing business  and the continued development and implementation of our software products and their ability to interact with other leading products 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
due to the thorough internal reviews and extensive negotiations conducted by existing and prospective banking customers in choosing outsource vendors  the process of entering into or renewing outsourcing agreements can take approximately six to twelve months or longer 
the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from acquisition or termination of these management contracts 
therefore  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contributions sometimes permit us to enter new markets without significant capital investment 
during  we established jiayintong beijing technology development co 
ltd  our owned joint venture with ray holdings in china euronet china  to enter atm outsourcing and management in china 
as of december   we have deployed and are providing all of the day to day outsourcing services for over atms through this joint venture 
under current agreements  during the next to months  we expect that the total number of atms in china  for which we will be providing all of the day to day outsourcing services  to increase to over atms 
we have established a technical processing and operations center in beijing to operate these atms  and we believe we are the first  and currently the only  provider of end to end atm outsourcing services in china 
we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business through the execution of an agreement with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
since the beginning of  we have devoted significant resources to the development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it generally involves the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions is usually settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 
prepaid processing segment the continued expansion and development of the prepaid processing segment business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the ability to negotiate new agreements in additional markets with mobile phone operators  agent financial institutions and retailers  the ability to use existing expertise and relationships with mobile operators and retailers to our advantage  the continuation of the trend towards conversion from scratch card solutions to electronic processing solutions for prepaid mobile airtime among mobile phone users  and the continued use of third party providers such as ourselves to supply this service  the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile phone market  our market share of the retail distribution capacity  the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in the prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain  our ability to add new and differentiated prepaid products in addition to those offered by mobile operators  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our money transfer segment  including providing money transfer services through our prepaid locations  the availability of financing for further expansion  and our ability to successfully integrate newly acquired operations with our existing operations 
during the first quarter  we completed the acquisitions of the stock of omega logic  ltd 
omega logic and brodos srl in romania brodos romania 
omega logic is a prepaid top up company based  and primarily operating  in the uk that enhanced our prepaid processing segment business in the uk brodos romania is a leading electronic prepaid mobile airtime processor in romania 
in mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion 
because of this factor  we are likely to cease experiencing the organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal that we have experienced historically 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the increase of commissions paid to retailers and increases in retailer attrition rates 
the combined impact of these factors in developed markets is a flattening of growth in the revenues and profits that we earn 
in other markets in which we operate  such as poland  germany and the us  many of the factors that may contribute to rapid growth conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution  growth in the prepaid market  expansion of our network of retailers and access to all mobile operators products remain present 
money transfer segment we completed the acquisition of ria in april  which expanded our money transfer and bill payment services business and makes euronet the third largest global money transfer company  based upon revenues and volumes 
the money transfer segment provides us with additional expansion opportunities 
the expansion and development of our money transfer business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the continued growth in worker migration and employment opportunities  the mitigation of economic and political factors that have had an adverse impact on money transfer volumes  such as the immigration developments occurring in the us during and  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment services among immigrant workers and the unbanked population in our markets  the ability to maintain our agent and correspondent networks  the ability to offer our products and services or develop new products and services at competitive prices to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our services in markets where we operate and in new markets  the ability to strengthen our brands  our ability to fund working capital requirements  our ability to maintain compliance with the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our prepaid processing segment  including providing prepaid services through our stores and agents worldwide  the ability to leverage our banking and merchant retailer relationships to expand money transfer corridors to europe and asia  including high growth corridors to central and eastern european countries  and our ability to continue to successfully integrate ria with our existing operations 
like other participants in the money transfer industry  as a result of immigration developments  downturns in certain labor markets and or other economic factors  growth rates in money transfers from the us to mexico have slowed 
this slowing of growth began during the middle of and continues to impact money transfer revenues for transactions from the us to mexico 
despite recent improvement in this trend  we believe that it is too early to conclude on the impact  if any  to our results of operations 
corporate services  eliminations and other in addition to operating in our principal business segments described above  our corporate services  elimination and other division includes non operating activity  certain inter segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the business segments  including share based compensation expense related to most stock option and restricted stock grants 
these services are not directly identifiable with our business segments 
the accounting policies of each segment are the same as those referenced in the summary of significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate performance of our segments based on income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes  foreign currency exchange gain loss  minority interest and other nonrecurring gains and losses 
for all segments  our continued expansion may involve additional acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base  particularly at the management level  which has added incremental operating costs 
an inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies  as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace 
segment revenues and operating income for the years ended december   and revenues operating income in thousands eft processing prepaid processing money transfer total corporate services total operating income amounts shown above for and have been adjusted for the impact of the correction for an immaterial error related to foreign currency translation adjustments for goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
see note  basis of presentation  for further discussion 
summary our annual consolidated revenues increased by for over  and for over these increases reflect acquisitions  primarily ria during  as well as growth in our existing business resulting from increases in the number of atms managed and transactions processed 
for further discussion regarding acquisitions  see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
our operating income increased for over  and for over these increases were the result of growth in revenues generated by existing business and newly acquired businesses  the impact of acquisitions and leveraging the company s cost structure  particularly in the eft processing segment 
the results for also include an increase in operating income of million for a federal excise tax refund discussed in note  federal excise tax refund  to the consolidated financial statements 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income for of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million  or per diluted share for in addition to the explanations above  net income for and included foreign currency exchange translation gains of million and million  respectively 
net income for included foreign currency exchange translation losses of million 
net income for includes a gain from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and net income for includes a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates beginning in and continuing into  the us dollar has weakened compared to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues and local expenses are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earned for are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
we estimate that  depending on the mix of countries and currencies  our results benefited by approximately to when compared to comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment eft processing segment as discussed previously  effective january   we began reporting and managing the operations of the eft processing segment and the former software solutions segment on a combined basis 
previously reported amounts have been adjusted to reflect these changes 
compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms revenues our revenue for increased when compared to primarily due to increases in the number of atms operated and  for owned atms  the number of transactions processed 
these increases were attributable to most of our operations  but primarily our operations in poland  india and greece and our software operations 
additionally  beginning in and continuing into  the us dollar has weakened compared to the currencies of most of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in revenues associated with the extension of certain customer contracts for several years beyond their original terms 
in exchange for these extensions  we paid or received up front payments and agreed on gradually declining fee structures 
as prescribed by us gaap  revenue under these contracts is recognized based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line ie  consistent value per period revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
this straight line revenue recognition results in revenue that is less than contractual invoices and cash receipts in the early periods of the agreement and revenue that is greater than the contractual invoices and cash receipts in the later years of the agreement 
as a result of the revenue recognition under these contracts  amounts invoiced under the contracts exceeded the amount of revenue that we recognized by about million for  compared to approximately million for we may decide to enter into similar arrangements with other eft processing segment customers 
average monthly revenue per atm was  for  compared to  for and revenue per transaction was for  compared to for the decrease in revenues per atm and revenues per transaction was due to the addition of atms where related revenue has not yet developed to mature levels  the impact of the contract extensions discussed above and the addition of atms in india where revenues per atm have been historically lower than central and eastern europe generally due to lower labor costs 
direct operating costs direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing centers facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
the increase in direct operating cost for  compared to  is attributed to the increase in the number of atms under operation 
additionally  includes losses of approximately million  primarily in poland and hungary  as a result of certain fraudulent transactions on our network 
we are taking remedial action to prevent similar transactions and expect the amounts to be reduced significantly in the first quarter and eliminated in the second quarter as of december   the losses include an estimated million in amounts related to transactions that have not yet been reported 
gross margin gross margin  which is calculated as revenues less direct operating costs  increased to million for from million for this increase is attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues is due to the impact of accounting for certain contract renewals  the fraudulent transaction losses and other fluctuations in revenues and direct operating costs discussed above  as well as the increased contributions of our subsidiary in india  which has historically earned a lower gross margin than our other operations 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to was due to staffing costs to expand in emerging markets  such as india  china and new european markets  and additional products  such as pos  card processing and cross border merchant processing and acquiring 
salaries and benefits also increased as a result of general merit increases awarded to employees and certain additional staffing requirements due to the larger number of atms under operation and transactions processed 
as a percentage of revenue  however  these costs remained relatively flat at of revenues for compared to for selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is due to costs to expand in emerging markets  such as india  china and new european markets  and additional products  such as pos  card processing and cross border merchant processing and acquiring 
additionally  during  we recorded a loss of million under an arbitral award granted by a tribunal in budapest  hungary arising from a claim by a former cash supply contractor in central europe 
the cash supply contractor claimed it provided us with cash during the fourth quarter and first quarter that was not returned 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were flat at for both and depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for compared to is due primarily to additional equipment and software for the expansion of our hungarian processing center incurred during  additional atms in poland and india and additional software amortization recorded related to our essentis software product 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses remained flat at of revenues for both and operating income the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in revenues described above  offset by the million decrease in revenues related to certain contract renewals  the million fraudulent card losses and the arbitration loss described in the sections above 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for and per transaction for compared to per transaction for adjusting for the impact of the fraudulent card losses and the arbitration loss  operating income as a percentage of revenue would have been and operating income per transaction would have been 
operating income for and also includes million and million  respectively  in losses associated with expanding operations for the company s owned joint venture in china 
as of december   we have deployed and are providing all of the day to day outsourcing services for over atms 
under current agreements  we expect that the total number of atms in china deployed and for which we will be providing day to day outsourcing services will increase to over during the next to months 
software sales backlog as of december   the eft segment had a software contract backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  such backlog represents software sales based on signed contracts under which we continue to have performance milestones before the sale will be completed 
we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method  based on certain milestone conditions  for our software solutions 
as a result  we have not recognized all the revenues associated with these sales contracts 
we cannot give assurances that the milestones under the contracts will be completed or that we will be able to recognize the related revenue within the next year 
compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms revenues our revenue for increased when compared to primarily due to increases in the number of atms operated and  for owned atms  the number of transactions processed  primarily in poland and india 
additionally  results include the full year impact of the acquisitions of instreamline now euronet card services greece  europlanet and essentis  which contributed incremental revenues of million in  compared to see note  acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about these acquisitions 
instreamline  acquired in october  provides credit card and pos outsourcing services and transaction gateway switching services in greece and the balkan region 
our ownership in europlanet was increased through two transactions one in april  in which we increased our ownership from to  and one in december  in which we acquired the final ownership 
we began consolidating europlanet after acquiring a controlling interest in april europlanet provides debit card processing services and manages a network of atms and pos terminals in serbia 
essentis is a uk company that owns a leading card issuing and merchant acquiring software package that allows us to add additional outsourcing and software offerings to financial institutions 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in revenue associated with the extension of certain customer contracts for several years beyond their original terms 
in exchange for these extensions  we paid or received an up front payment and agreed on a gradually declining fee structure 
revenue under these contracts is recognized based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line ie  consistent value per period revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
this straight line revenue recognition results in revenue recognized in an amount less than contractual cash receipts in the early periods of the agreement and revenue recognized in an amount greater than the contractual cash receipts in the later years of the agreement 
as a result of the revenue recognition under these contracts  amounts invoiced under the contracts exceeded the amount of revenue that we recognized by about million for average monthly revenue per atm was  for  compared to  for and revenue per transaction was for  compared to for these increases are  in part  due to increases in non atm revenues  primarily associated with essentis  which records revenue from the sale of software  and euronet card services greece  which provides pos and credit card outsourcing services and debit card transaction gateway switching services 
under outsourcing agreements  we primarily earn revenue based on a fixed recurring monthly management fee  with less dependence on transaction based fees 
direct operating costs the increase in direct operating costs for  compared to  is attributed to the acquisitions described above and an increase in the number of atms under operation 
direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues was relatively flat at for  compared to for gross margin gross margin increased to million for from million for average monthly gross margin per atm increased to  for  compared to for  and gross margin per transaction was relatively flat at for  compared to for these increases were primarily due to increases in non atm revenues related to essentis and euronet card services greece described above 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for  compared to is due to the acquisition of instreamline  europlanet and essentis  staffing costs to expand in emerging markets  such as india  china and new european markets  and additional products  such as pos and card processing 
salaries and benefits also increased as a result of general merit increases awarded to employees and certain additional staffing requirements due to the larger number of atms under operation and transactions processed 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs increased slightly to for from for  primarily due to the acquisition of essentis  which is generally a more labor intensive business than the other eft processing segment entities 
selling  general and administrative similar to the increase in salaries and benefits  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for  compared to is also due primarily to the acquisitions of instreamline  europlanet and essentis and costs incurred to expand in emerging markets and additional products 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs increased slightly to of revenue for  compared to of revenue for offsetting these costs for was million for an insurance recovery that related to a loss recorded in the fourth quarter on certain atm disbursements resulting from a card association s change in their data exchange format 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for  compared to is due primarily to depreciation and intangible amortization related to the acquisitions of instreamline and  to a lesser extent  essentis and europlanet  as well as depreciation on additional atms under capital lease arrangements related to outsourcing agreements in india 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses were of revenue for both and approximately million of depreciation and amortization for represents amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisitions of instreamline  essentis and europlanet  compared to million recorded during operating income the increase in operating income for the segment is generally the result of increased revenue and the related gross margins described above  combined with leveraging certain management cost structures 
operating income as a percentage of revenue was for  compared to for and operating income per transaction was for both and the slight decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to essentis  which recorded an operating income margin during average monthly operating income per atm was for  compared to for operating income is partially offset by losses related to our owned joint venture in china of million for and million in prepaid processing segment effective in the second quarter  as a result of the acquisition of ria  we established the money transfer segment 
our previous money transfer business was relatively insignificant and was reported and managed as part of the prepaid processing segment 
we have adjusted previously reported amounts to reflect the reclassification of the money transfer business from the prepaid processing segment to money transfer segment for all periods presented 
compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the prepaid processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative federal excise tax refund   n m depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions n m not meaningful 
revenues the increase in revenues for compared to was generally attributable to i the increase in total transactions processed across all of our prepaid processing segment operations  ii million in revenues contributed by omega logic and brodos romania  which were acquired in the first quarter  and iii foreign currency translations to the us dollar 
beginning in and continuing into  the us dollar weakened compared to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
revenue growth was partially offset by reduced revenue growth in spain resulting from the second quarter expiration of a preferential commission arrangement with a spanish mobile operator 
additionally  in certain more mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  our revenue growth has slowed substantially and  in some cases  revenues have decreased because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up is substantially complete and certain mobile operators and retailers are driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
we expect most of our future revenue growth to be derived from i developing markets or markets in which there is organic growth in the prepaid sector overall  ii from continued conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up in less mature markets  iii from additional products sold over the base of prepaid processing terminals  and iv possibly from acquisitions 
revenues per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the growth in revenues and transactions recorded by our atx subsidiary  which is euronet owned 
in accordance with us gaap  atx is consolidated and the amounts in our financial statements and in the table above reflect of atx 
results attributable to the minority owner are reflected in the minority interest line of our consolidated statements of income 
atx provides only transaction processing services without direct costs and other operating costs generally associated with installing and managing terminals  therefore  the revenue we recognize from these transactions is a fraction of that recognized on average transactions but with very low cost 
transaction volumes for atx in increased over compared to partially offsetting the decreases described above was the growth in both volumes and revenues in australia and the us  which generally have higher revenues per transaction  but also pay higher commission rates to retailers  than our other prepaid processing subsidiaries 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  as well as expenses required to operate pos terminals 
because of their nature  these expenditures generally fluctuate directly with revenues and processed transactions 
the increase in direct operating costs is generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed and foreign currency translations to the us dollar compared to the prior year 
gross margin gross margin  which represents revenues less direct costs  was million for compared to million for gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to for compared to for and gross margin per transaction was for compared to for most of the reduction in gross margin per transaction is due to the growth of revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary  the expiration of preferential commission arrangements in spain discussed above and the general maturity of the prepaid mobile airtime business in many of our markets 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is primarily the result of the acquisitions of brodos romania and omega logic  as well as additional overhead to support development in other new and growing markets 
as a percentage of revenue  salaries and benefits remained flat at for both and selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is the result of the acquisitions of brodos romania and omega logic  as well as additional overhead to support development in other new and growing markets 
as a percentage of revenues these selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for both and federal excise tax refund during  the internal revenue service irs announced that internal revenue code section relating to communications excise tax will no longer apply to  among other services  prepaid mobile airtime services such as those offered by the prepaid processing segment s us operations 
additionally  companies that paid this excise tax during the period beginning on march  and ending on july   are entitled to a credit or refund of amounts paid in conjunction with the filing of federal income tax returns 
during  million was recorded for amounts paid during this period as a reduction to operating expenses of the prepaid processing segment and as an other current asset 
in addition  approximately million is expected to be received in interest on the amount claimed  which will be recorded as interest income when received 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and the depreciation of pos terminals we install in retail stores 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to was primarily due to the acquisitions of brodos romania and omega logic 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization decreased slightly to for from for goodwill and acquired intangible translation adjustment during the third quarter we corrected an immaterial error related to foreign currency translation adjustments for goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions completed during periods prior to december  the impact of this correction on the prepaid processing segment was to increase depreciation and amortization expense and decrease operating income by million for each of the years ended december  and operating income the improvement in operating income for compared to was due to the significant growth in revenues and transactions processed  the federal excise tax refund and the benefit of foreign currency translations to the us dollar  partially offset by the impact of the events in spain discussed above and the costs of development in new and growing markets 
excluding the benefit of the federal excise tax refund  operating income as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the decrease is primarily due to the events in spain and operating expenses incurred to support development in new and growing markets 
also excluding the federal excise tax refund  operating income per transaction was for compared to for the decrease in operating income per transaction is due to the events in spain  the impact of maturing markets and the growth in revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary 
these decreases were partially offset by the benefit of foreign currency translations to the us dollar 
compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the prepaid processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions revenues the increase in revenues for compared to was generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed across all of our prepaid processing operations and the full year impact of acquisitions 
revenue growth was offset by reduced revenue in spain resulting from expiration of the preferential commission arrangements with a spanish mobile operator 
when we acquired our spanish prepaid subsidiaries  we entered into agreements with a major mobile operator under which the subsidiaries received a preferred  exclusive distributor commission on sales of prepaid mobile airtime 
this arrangement expired in may and was not renewed 
additionally  in mature markets  such as the uk and australia  our revenue growth slowed substantially and  in some cases  revenues have decreased because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up is substantially complete and certain mobile operators and retailers are driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
revenue per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the growth in revenues and transactions recorded by our atx subsidiary  which was acquired at the end of the first quarter transaction volumes at atx have increased by approximately for  compared to for  atx transaction volumes accounted for approximately of all transaction volume for the prepaid processing segment  compared to for the expiration of preferential commission arrangements in spain discussed above also contributed to the decrease in revenue per transaction 
partially offsetting the decreases described above for  compared to  were the growth in both volumes and revenues in the us direct operating costs the increase in direct operating costs is generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed over the prior year 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue are slightly higher in our mature markets  such as the uk and spain 
these higher costs have been partially offset during by lower direct costs as a percentage of revenue in other markets and by atx 
as discussed above  atx is a transaction processor  with very few direct costs and  accordingly  a high gross margin percentage 
gross margin gross margin was million for  compared to million for gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for  compared to for and gross margin per transaction was for  compared to per transaction for most of the reduction in gross margin per transaction is due to the growth of revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary and the expiration of preferential commission arrangements in spain discussed above 
although we were able to pass through our reduction in commission in spain to the retailers under our contracts with them by paying a lower distribution commission  we chose to pass through only a portion of the reduction to guard against the loss of retailers 
also during  we commenced distribution of additional products and prepaid airtime from the two other mobile operators in spain 
as a result of the expiration of preferential commission arrangements in spain  partially offset by the distribution of products from the other mobile operators in spain  gross margin for was approximately million lower than this reduction would have been larger  except for the completion of a significant acquisition in spain during march additional decreases in gross margin per transaction were experienced across most of our other countries and were partially offset by increased transaction volumes in markets with higher margins  such as australia  new zealand and the us salaries and benefits the slight increase in salaries and benefits for  compared to is primarily the result of the full year effect of acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  salaries and benefits have decreased slightly to for  from for the decrease in salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue reflects leverage and scalability in our markets 
selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses generally is also the result of the full year effect of acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue these selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue for  compared to of revenue for  also as a result of our leverage and scalability in our markets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and the depreciation of pos terminals we install in retail stores 
the increase for  compared to  is due to the full year effect of amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization was relatively flat at for  compared to for goodwill and acquired intangible translation adjustment during the third quarter we corrected an immaterial error related to foreign currency translation adjustments for goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions completed during periods prior to december  the impact of this correction on the prepaid processing segment was to increase depreciation and amortization expense and decrease operating income by million for each of the years ended december  and operating income the increase in operating income for compared to includes a reduction of approximately million related to the impact of the developments in spain discussed above 
exclusive of the impact of spain  the improvement in operating income for was due to the growth in revenues and transactions processed  contributions from our acquisitions and increased leverage and scalability in our markets 
operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for operating income per transaction decreased to for  from for as discussed above  these decreases in operating income as a percentage of revenue and per transaction are the result of the developments in spain  the growth in revenues and transactions associated with atx and gross margin declines across several of our other countries 
these decreases were partially offset by increased transactions in markets with higher operating margins  such as australia  new zealand and the us money transfer segment the money transfer segment was established during april with the acquisition of ria  which is more fully described in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
to assist in better understanding the results of the money transfer segment  unaudited pro forma results have been provided as if ria s results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning january  because our results of operations for the year ended december  were insignificant  and fluctuations when compared to the year ended december  are nearly entirely due to the acquisition of ria  the following discussion and analysis will focus on pro forma results of operations 
the pro forma financial information is not intended to represent  or be indicative of  the consolidated results of operations or financial condition that would have been reported had the ria acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented 
moreover  the pro forma financial information should not be considered as representative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the money transfer segment generated total revenues of million and an operating loss of million for the year ended december  based on the insignificance of the money transfer business prior to the acquisition of ria  we have not provided analysis comparing the and operations 
the following tables present the actual results of operations for the years ended december  and for the money transfer segment 
as reported year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income    n m transactions processed millions n m not meaningful 
the following tables present the pro forma results of operations for the years ended december  and for the money transfer segment pro forma unaudited year ended december  year over year change increase increase dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income pro forma transactions processed millions comparison of pro forma operating results during  we combined our previous money transfer business with ria and incurred total exit costs of million 
these costs represented the accelerated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  software and leasehold improvements that were disposed of during  the write off of marketing materials and trademarks that have been discontinued or will not be used  the write off of accounts receivable from agents that did not meet ria s credit requirements  and severance and retention payments made to certain employees 
these exit costs are not included in pro forma operating expenses in the above table 
revenues revenues from the money transfer segment include a transaction fee for each transaction as well as the difference between purchasing currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to customers at retail exchange rates 
pro forma revenue per transaction increased slightly to for from for on a historical basis  about of our money transfer segment revenues are derived from transaction fees  about is derived from the foreign currency spread and other small amounts of revenue are derived from sources such as fees for cashing checks  issuing money orders and processing bill payments 
for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries  such as canada and australia 
for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries 
we expect that the us will continue to represent our highest volume market  however  significant future growth is expected to be derived from non us initiated sources 
the increase in pro forma revenues for compared to is due to an increase in the number of transactions processed of for compared to for  money transfers to mexico  which represented of total money transfers  decreased by  while transfers to all other countries increased when compared to the prior year due to the expansion of our operations and continued growth in immigrant worker populations 
the decline in transfers to mexico was largely the result of immigration developments  downturns in certain labor markets and other economic factors impacting the us market 
these issues have also resulted in certain competitors lowering transaction fees and foreign currency exchange spreads in certain markets where we do business in an attempt to limit the impact on money transfer volumes 
during the second half of  however  total money transfers to mexico slightly exceeded total money transfers to mexico during the second half of direct operating costs direct operating costs in the money transfer segment primarily represent commissions paid to agents that originate money transfers on our behalf and distribution agents that disburse funds to the customers destination beneficiary  together with less significant costs  such as telecommunication and bank fees to collect money from originating agents 
direct operating costs generally increase or decrease by a similar percentage as revenues 
gross margin pro forma gross margin  which represents revenues less direct costs  was million for compared to million for this slight improvement is primarily due to the growth in money transfer transactions discussed above 
pro forma gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for both and salaries and benefits salaries and benefits include salaries and commissions paid to employees  the cost of providing employee benefits  amounts paid to contract workers and accruals for incentive compensation 
pro forma salaries and benefits for also include costs associated with our previous money transfer business that generally have been eliminated from our cost structure beginning in the second quarter the increase for compared to is primarily due to overall company growth 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include operations support costs  such as rent  utilities  professional fees  indirect telecommunications  advertising and other miscellaneous overhead costs 
pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for were relatively flat compared to however  the prior year pro forma results include costs associated with our previous money transfer business  which generally have been eliminated from our cost structure beginning in the second quarter excluding the impact of these costs  the increase in pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is due primarily to overall company growth 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and also includes depreciation of money transfer terminals  computers and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
the increase in pro forma depreciation and amortization for compared to is primarily due to additional computer equipment in our customer service centers and increased leasehold improvements  office equipment and computer equipment for expansion 
operating income the increase in pro forma operating income for compared to is the result of increased pro forma revenues  without commensurate increases in pro forma operating expenses  as discussed in more detail in the sections above 
corporate services the components of corporate services operating expenses for  and were as follows year over year change increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating expenses for corporate services increased by for both and  compared to the respective prior year 
the decrease in salaries and benefits compensation for compared to was due primarily to lower incentive compensation accruals and the december resignation of our former president and chief operating officer 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly the result of higher professional fees and other expenses associated with acquisitions that were not completed  including envios de valores la nacional corp 
la nacional 
see note  litigation and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding la nacional 
the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is the result of amortization associated with the purchase of a company wide three year microsoft license 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense for  compared to is primarily attributable to additional expense recorded for share based compensation in share based compensation expense increased to million for  compared to million for share based compensation expense for is comprised of million related to the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to and million for restricted stock awards granted primarily during and this increase of million in share based compensation expense for compared to is due mainly to i million in additional expense due to changes in the accounting treatment for performance based restricted stock awards that require expense to be recognized over a graded attribution schedule  rather than a straight line attribution schedule  resulting in more expense in the early years of an award  and ii million in increased expense due to additional performance based awards to certain executives during and additional awards to employees resulting from overall company growth  including acquired businesses 
the remaining increase in million increase in salaries and benefits expense is due to incremental expense from overall company growth 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for  compared to was the result of lower professional fees and other expenses associated with acquisition analysis during  compared to other income expense year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent interest income interest expense income from unconsolidated affiliates loss on early retirement of debt n m foreign currency exchange gain loss  net    n m total other income expense    n m n m not meaningful 
interest income the increase in interest income for over was primarily due to investment of the unused proceeds from the million private equity placement that was completed during march  as well as cash generated from operations 
the increase in interest income for over was primarily due to interest earned on the unused proceeds from the million october convertible debt issuance and cash generated from operations 
increasing average cash deposits held in our trust accounts related to the administration of customer collections and vendor remittance activities of the prepaid processing segment have also generated increased interest income as the segment s operations have grown 
improvements in interest income for both and  when compared to the respective previous year  were also due to higher average interest rates resulting from a gradual shift of investments from money market accounts to commercial paper and the general rise in short term treasury rates throughout from through recently this trend has reversed and short term interest rates have decreased substantially during the first quarter if this trend continues  we expect that interest rates earned on our invested balances for will decrease as a result 
interest expense the increase in interest expense for over was primarily related to the additional borrowings to finance the april acquisition of ria  which comprises our new money transfer segment  and described in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we incurred additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility to finance the working capital requirements of the money transfer segment 
we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
the increase in interest expense is also due to higher overall interest rates on our debt obligations in compared to including amortization of deferred financing costs  interest expense on the term loan and revolving credit facility is approximately  compared to approximately for the million in outstanding convertible debentures 
the increase in interest expense for over was primarily the result of the issuance of million in convertible debt during described in note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
similar to the impact on interest income  due to the recent trend of decreasing short term interest rates  we expect that interest rates paid on our borrowings for will also decrease 
income from unconsolidated affiliates the increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates recorded for compared to was primarily because we recognized a gain of million in from the sale of our ownership interest in cashnet telecommunications egypt sae 
the remainder of income from unconsolidated affiliates represents the equity in income of our equity investment in e pay malaysia 
during  we recognized million of equity losses related to e pay malaysia s unsuccessful expansion efforts into indonesia 
as of december   our investment in e pay malaysia was million and  based on the performance of e pay malaysia s core business  as well future expectations  we do not believe that the amount recorded as investment in e pay malaysia is impaired 
the decrease in income from unconsolidated affiliates for compared to was primarily due to million in dividends recorded during related to europlanet and atx  which were declared before we obtained control of these entities 
in addition  included million in losses recorded by euronet middle east  our eft processing segment joint venture in bahrain 
loss on early retirement of debt loss on early retirement of debt of million for represents the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs associated with the portion of the million term loan that was prepaid during we expect to continue to prepay amounts outstanding under the term loan through available cash flows and  accordingly  recognizing losses on early retirement of debt for the pro rata portion of unamortized deferred financing costs 
net foreign currency exchange gain loss assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of each of our subsidiaries give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of these assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income 
we recorded a net foreign currency exchange gain of million and million during and  respectively  and net foreign currency exchange loss of million during the foreign currency exchange gain or loss recorded is a result of the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the recorded value of these assets and liabilities 
throughout both and  the us dollar weakened against most european based currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  creating realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains 
this compares to  during which time the us dollar strengthened against these currencies and we  therefore  recorded realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange losses 
income tax expense year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest minority interest income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations effective income tax rate income from continuing operations before income taxes adjust foreign exchange gain loss  net income from continuing operations before income taxes and foreign exchange gain loss  net effective income tax rate  excluding foreign exchange gain loss  net we calculate our effective tax rate by dividing income tax expense by pre tax book income including the effect of minority interest 
our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding foreign currency exchange translation results from pre tax income  our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for  excluding foreign currency gains and losses  primarily relates to the recognition of deferred income tax expense in the us attributable to the utilization of tax net operating losses against significant pre tax income generated by the our us operations from foreign currency gains  interest income earned on loans to our foreign subsidiaries and the million federal excise tax refund 
the effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by the acquisition of ria  which operates in jurisdictions that have tax rates that are higher than our historical effective tax rate  and the recognition of deferred tax benefits for net operating losses in certain countries during tax expense in the us was partly reduced by the reversal of our remaining valuation allowances against our us tax net operating loss 
consequently  should we generate pre tax income for financial reporting purposes in the us during  including income from the recognition of additional foreign currency gains  we would be required to recognize deferred tax expense on such income 
for us federal income tax purposes  however  as of december   we have approximately million of net operating losses that will offset taxable income in future periods generated from pre tax income produced by our us operations and the recognition of the future tax effects of temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities 
we determine income tax expense and remit income taxes based upon enacted tax laws and regulations applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
based on our interpretation of such laws and regulations  and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts  we have accrued the estimated tax effects of certain transactions  business ventures  contractual and organizational structures  projected business unit performance  and the estimated future reversal of timing differences 
should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws and regulations or dispute our conclusions  or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions  the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements 
other minority interest minority interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
minority interest represents the elimination of the net income loss attributable to the minority shareholders portion of our consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned  including movilcarga  of which we own  atx  of which we own  our subsidiary in china  of which we own  and europlanet  of which we owned until the end of  when we acquired the remaining ownership 
discontinued operations discontinued operations for reflects a gain of million  net of legal costs  after we received a binding french supreme court decision relating to a lawsuit in france that resulted in a cash recovery 
discontinued operations for include a million loss on the final liquidation of the france atm network processing services business sold in this loss consists primarily of the reclassification to net income of the cumulative translation adjustment that had previously been recorded as a component stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income due to the prior years consolidation of the operations in france 
there were no assets or liabilities held for sale at december  or net income we recorded net income of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase of million in over was primarily the result of an increase in operating income of million  including the federal excise tax refund of million  an increase in the net foreign currency exchange gain of million  an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates of million and a gain from discontinued operations of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in net interest expense of million  an increase in income tax expense of million  a loss on early retirement of debt of million and an increase in income attributable to minority interest of million 
as more fully discussed above  the increase of million for compared to was the result of an increase in operating income of million  an improvement in foreign currency exchange gain loss of million  a decrease in net interest expense of million  a decrease in income tax expense of million and other items of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december   we had working capital  which is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities  of million  compared to working capital of million as of december  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to as of december  the decrease in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was due primarily to the reduction in cash of approximately million for the acquisition of ria  mostly offset by million in net proceeds from the private equity offering that we completed during march as of december   million of the net proceeds from the offering remained unused and included in unrestricted cash 
we require substantial working capital to finance operations 
the money transfer segment funds the correspondent distribution network before receiving the benefit of amounts collected from customers by agents 
working capital needs increase due to weekends and international banking holidays 
as a result  we may report more or less working capital for the money transfer segment based solely upon the fiscal period ending on a particular day 
as of december   excluding restricted cash held in escrow in connection with the agreement to acquire la nacional  working capital in the money transfer segment was million 
we expect that working capital needs will increase as we expand this business 
operating cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities decreased to million for  compared to million for  primarily due to fluctuations in working capital associated with the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators in the prepaid processing segment 
offsetting this decrease  operating cash flows also reflect an increase in net income  net of depreciation and amortization expense  and the federal excise tax refund  which was accrued in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of the acquisition of ria 
investing activity cash flows cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in our investing activities for consisted of million in cash paid related to acquisitions  primarily ria  million for the purchase of moneygram common stock and million placed in escrow in connection with the agreement to acquire la nacional 
see further discussion regarding the agreement to acquire la nacional under contingencies below 
we also spent million for purchases of property and equipment and software development 
our investing activities for include million in cash paid for acquisitions and million for purchases of property and equipment and software development 
financing activity cash flows cash flows from financing activities were million in  compared to million in our financing inflows for consisted primarily of million in proceeds from borrowings under our term loan agreement and million from the equity private placement and stock option exercises 
the proceeds from the term loan were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of ria 
partially offsetting these increases were repayments and early retirements of debt obligations of million  repayments of capital lease obligations of million  dividends paid to minority interest stockholders of million and debt issuance costs associated with our new syndicated credit facility of million 
to support the short term cash needs of our money transfer segment  we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
primarily as a result of this  during  we had a total of million in borrowings and million in repayments under our revolving credit facility 
our financing activities for consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee share purchases of million and net borrowings on short term debt and revolving credit agreements of million  partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations totaling million 
other sources of capital credit facility in connection with completing the acquisition of ria discussed under opportunities and challenges above  we entered into a million secured credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility together  the credit facility 
the million seven year term loan bears interest at libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points and requires that we repay million of the balance each year  with the remaining balance payable after seven years 
we estimate that we will be able to repay the million term loan prior to its maturity date through cash flows available from operations  provided our operating cash flows are not required for future business developments 
financing costs of million have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans 
the million five year revolving credit facility replaced our previously existing revolving credit facility and bears interest at libor or prime plus a margin that adjusts each quarter based upon our consolidated total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio 
we intend to use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund working capital requirements  which have increased as a result of the operations of our money transfer segment 
based on our current projected working capital requirements  we anticipate that our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs 
we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before any potential repurchase date under our million convertible senior debentures due or our million convertible debentures due  unless we are able to demonstrate that either i we could borrow unsubordinated funded debt equal to the principal amount of the applicable convertible debentures while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility or ii we will have sufficient liquidity to meet repayment requirements as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders 
the credit facility contains three financial covenants that become more restrictive through september  total debt to ebitda ratio  senior secured debt to ebitda ratio and ebitda to fixed charge coverage ratio 
because of the change to these covenants over time  in order to remain in compliance with our debt covenants we may be required to increase our ebitda  repay debt  or both 
these and other material terms and conditions applicable to the credit facility are described in the agreement governing the credit facility 
the term loan may be expanded by up to an additional million and the revolving credit facility can be expanded by up to an additional million  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
as of december   after making required repayments on the term loan of million and voluntary prepayments of million  we had borrowings of million outstanding against the term loan 
we had borrowings of million and stand by letters of credit of million outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
the remaining million under the revolving credit facility million if the facility were increased to million was available for borrowing 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are being used to fund short term working capital requirements in the us  spain and india 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility was and under the term loan was  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs 
short term debt obligations short term debt obligations at december  consist only of the million annual repayment requirement under the term loan 
certain of our subsidiaries also have available credit lines and overdraft facilities to supplement short term working capital requirements  when necessary 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities 
our prepaid processing segment subsidiaries in spain enter into agreements with financial institutions to receive cash in advance of collections on customers accounts 
these arrangements can be with or without recourse and the financial institutions charge the spanish subsidiaries transaction fees and or interest in connection with these advances 
cash received can be up to days prior to the customer invoice due dates 
accordingly  the spanish subsidiaries remain obligated to the banks on the cash advance until the underlying accounts receivable are ultimately collected 
where the risk of collection remains with euronet  the receipt of cash continues to be carried on the consolidated balance sheet in each of trade accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
amounts outstanding under these arrangements are generally million or less 
we believe that the short term debt obligations can be refinanced at terms acceptable to us 
however  if acceptable refinancing options are not available  we believe that amounts due under these obligations can be funded through cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
convertible debt we have million in principal amount of convertible debentures due that are convertible into million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest for the six month period from october  through april  and for each six month period thereafter from april to october or october to april if the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by us until october  but are redeemable at par at any time thereafter 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on october   and  or upon a change in control of the company 
on the maturity date  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
we also have million in principal amount of convertible senior debentures due that are convertible into million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest for the six month period from december  through june  and for each six month period thereafter from june to december or december to june if the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by us until december  but are redeemable at any time thereafter at par 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on december   and  and upon a change in control of the company 
on the maturity date  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
should holders of the convertible debentures require us to repurchase their debentures on the dates outlined above  we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash on hand or have acceptable financing options available to us to fund these required repurchases 
an inability to be able to finance these potential repayments could have an adverse impact on our operations 
these terms and other material terms and conditions applicable to the convertible debentures are set forth in the indenture agreements governing these debentures and in note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from issuance of shares and other capital contributions we have established  and shareholders have approved  share compensation plans the scp that allow the company to make grants of shares of restricted common stock  or options to purchase shares of common stock  to certain current and prospective key employees  directors and consultants 
during   stock options were exercised at an average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
we also sponsor a qualified employee stock purchase plan espp under which we reserved  shares of common stock for purchase under the plan by employees through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of offerings commence at the beginning of each quarter and expire at the end of the quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last day of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
during  we issued  shares at an average price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
these plans are discussed further in note  stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
other uses of capital payment obligations related to acquisitions as partial consideration for the acquisition of ria  we granted the sellers of ria  contingent value rights cvrs and  stock appreciation rights sars 
the  cvrs mature on october  and will result in the issuance of up to million of additional shares of euronet common stock or payment of additional cash  at our option  if the price of euronet common stock is less than on the maturity date 
the  sars entitle the sellers to acquire additional shares of euronet common stock at an exercise price of at any time through october  combined  the cvrs and sars entitle the sellers to additional consideration of at least million in euronet common stock or cash 
the sars also provide potential additional value to the sellers for situations in which euronet common stock appreciates beyond per share prior to october   which is to be settled through the issuance of additional shares of euronet common stock 
these and other terms and conditions applicable to the cvrs and sars are set forth in the agreements governing these instruments 
we have potential contingent obligations to the former owner of the net assets of movilcarga 
based upon presently available information  we do not believe any additional payments will be required 
the seller has disputed this conclusion and has initiated ad hoc arbitration as provided for in the purchase agreement 
a global public accounting firm has been engaged as an independent expert to review the results of the computation 
any additional payments  if ultimately determined to be owed the seller  will be recorded as additional goodwill and could be made in either cash or a combination of cash and euronet common stock at our option 
in connection with the acquisition of brodos romania  we agreed to contingent consideration arrangements based on the achievement of certain performance criteria 
if the criteria are achieved  during and  we would have to pay a total of million in cash or  shares of euronet common stock  at the option of the seller 
see the section entitled contingencies below for discussion of liquidity and capital resources involving a settlement agreement related to a previous agreement to acquire la nacional 
leases we lease atms and other property and equipment under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
the majority of these lease agreements are entered into in connection with long term outsourcing agreements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
generally  the leases may be canceled without penalty upon reasonable notice in the unlikely event the bank or we were to terminate the related outsourcing agreement 
we expect that  if terms were acceptable  we would acquire more atms from banks under such outsourcing and lease agreements 
capital expenditures and needs total capital expenditures for were million  of which million were funded through capital leases 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of atms to meet contractual requirements in poland and india  the purchase and installation of atms in key under penetrated markets  the purchase of pos terminals for the prepaid processing and money transfer segments  and office and data center computer equipment and software 
we also incurred million during for a company wide  three year microsoft license 
included in capital expenditures for office and data center equipment and software for is approximately million in capital expenditures for the purchase and development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million 
an additional million in software development cost was capitalized during for the development and enhancement of our eft processing segment software products 
see note  computer software to be sold  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
in the prepaid processing segment  approximately  of the approximately  pos devices that we operate are company owned  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as our prepaid processing segment expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to total terminals operated to remain relatively constant 
at current and projected cash flow levels  we anticipate that cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand and amounts available under our recently amended revolving credit facility and other existing and potential future financing will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing  contingent acquisition and capital expenditure obligations 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance our debt under terms acceptable to us 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or other obligations 
in the eft processing segment  we are required to maintain atm hardware for euronet owned atms and software for all atms in our network and in our processing centers in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support 
during the first quarter  we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures at our processing center in budapest  hungary for further emv upgrades 
additionally  as regulations change or new regulations or mandates are issued  we may have additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
while we do not currently have plans to increase capital expenditures to expand our network of owned atms  we expect that if strategic opportunities were available to us  we would consider increasing future capital expenditures to expand this network in new or existing markets 
litigation during  a former cash supply contractor in central europe the contractor claimed that we owed approximately million for the provision of cash during the fourth quarter and first quarter that had not been returned 
this claim was made after we terminated our business with the contractor and established a cash supply agreement with another supplier 
in the first quarter  the contractor initiated legal action in budapest  hungary regarding the claim 
in april  an arbitration tribunal awarded the contractor million  plus million in interest  under the claim  which was paid and recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses of the eft processing segment during contingencies settlement agreement with la nacional on january   we signed a stock purchase agreement to acquire la nacional and certain of its affiliates  subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
in connection with this agreement  on january  we deposited million in an escrow account created for the proposed acquisition 
the escrowed funds were not permitted to be released except upon mutual agreement between la nacional s stockholder and us or through legal remedies available in the agreement 
on april   we gave notice to the stockholder of la nacional of the termination of the stock purchase agreement  alleging certain breaches of the terms thereof by la nacional and requested the release of the million held in escrow under the terms of the agreement 
la nacional s stockholder denied such breaches occurred  contested such termination and did not consent to our request for release of the escrowed funds 
while pursuing all legal remedies available to us  we engaged in negotiations with la nacional and its stockholder to determine whether the dispute could be resolved through revised terms for the acquisition or some other mutually agreeable method 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with la nacional  certain of its affiliates and its stockholder evidencing the parties mutual agreement not to consummate the acquisition of la nacional and certain of its affiliates  in exchange for payment by euronet of a portion of the legal fees incurred by la nacional 
among other terms and conditions  the settlement agreement contains mutual releases in connection with litigation and provided for the release to us of the million held in escrow  plus interest earned on the escrowed funds 
in connection with the settlement  we expensed million in acquisition costs and other settlement costs during from time to time  we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
currently  there are no other contingencies that we believe  either individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
other trends and uncertainties cross border merchant processing and acquiring in our eft processing segment  we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  with the execution of an agreement with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
since the beginning of  we have devoted significant resources  including capital expenditures of approximately million  to the ongoing investment in development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it will involve the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions will be settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional capital expenditures associated with the development of the necessary systems and capabilities to enter this business 
we expect that the necessary systems and capabilities will be completed and we will be processing transactions during the first quarter fraudulent card transactions during the fourth quarter  we recorded losses of approximately million  primarily in poland and hungary  as a result of certain fraudulent transactions on our network 
we are taking remedial action to prevent similar transactions and expect the amounts to be reduced significantly in the first quarter and eliminated in the second quarter stock plans historically  the compensation committee of our board of directors has awarded nonvested shares or nonvested share units restricted stock and stock options as an element of long term management incentive compensation 
the amount of future compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock is based on the market price for euronet common stock at the grant date 
for grants of stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model for the determination of fair value for stock option grants and plan to use the black scholes option pricing model for future stock option grants  if any 
the grant date for stock options or restricted stock is the date at which all key terms and conditions of the grant have been determined and the company becomes contingently obligated to transfer assets to the employee who renders the requisite service  generally the date at which grants are approved by our board of directors or compensation committee thereof 
share based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is generally recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  expense is recognized on a graded attribution method 
the graded attribution method results in expense recognition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of an award  as if the award was  in substance  multiple awards 
expense for stock options and restricted stock is generally recorded as a corporate expense 
we have total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option and restricted stock awards of million that will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries in which we operate have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate 
off balance sheet arrangements we have certain significant off balance sheet items described below and in the following section  contractual obligations also see note  guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  we had million of bank guarantees issued on our behalf  of which million are collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks 
on occasion we grant guarantees in support of obligations of subsidiaries 
as of december   we had granted guarantees for cash in various atm networks amounting to million over the terms of the cash supply agreements and performance guarantees amounting to approximately million over the terms of the agreements with the customers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with unaffiliated parties that contain indemnification provisions  the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement 
the amount of such obligations is not stated in the agreements 
our liability under such indemnification provisions may be subject to time and materiality limitations  monetary caps and other conditions and defenses 
such indemnity obligations include the following in connection with contracts with financial institutions in the eft processing segment  we are responsible for damages to atms and theft of atm network cash that  generally  is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the balance of atm network cash for which the we were responsible was approximately million 
we maintain insurance policies to mitigate this exposure  in connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers  we provide certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee  which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications  we have entered into purchase and service agreements with our vendors and into consulting agreements with providers of consulting services  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants  respectively  against third party claims arising from our use of the vendor s product or the services of the vendor or consultant  in connection with acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  operating units and business assets  we have entered into agreements containing indemnification provisions  which are generally described as follows i in connection with acquisitions made by euronet  we have agreed to indemnify the seller against third party claims made against the seller relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or asset and arising after the closing of the transaction  and ii in connection with dispositions made by us  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer against damages incurred by the buyer due to the buyer s reliance on representations and warranties relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or business assets in the disposition agreement if such representations or warranties were untrue when made  we have entered into agreements with certain third parties  including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to euronet or to our benefit plans 
under such agreements  we have agreed to indemnify such service providers for third party claims relating to the carrying out of their respective duties under such agreements  and in connection with our entry into the money transfer business  we have issued surety bonds in compliance with licensing requirements of the applicable governmental authorities 
we are also required to meet minimum capitalization and cash requirements of various regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we have money transfer operations 
we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or third parties to guarantee agreements with us and  accordingly  no liabilities were recorded as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations  including interest estimated contingent acquisition obligations obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases total for the purposes of the above table  our million convertible debentures issued in december are considered due during  and our million convertible debentures issued in october are considered due during  representing the first years in which holders have the right to exercise their put option 
additionally  the above table only includes interest on these convertible debentures up to these dates 
although in certain circumstances we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before any potential repurchase date under our million in convertible debentures  the table above assumes that these circumstances will not be met and the credit facility will be fully repaid at maturity 
we have assumed million will be outstanding at all times under the revolving credit facility 
the computation of interest for debt obligations with variable interest rates reflects interest rates in effect at december  for additional information on debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
estimated contingent acquisition obligations as of december  include million in cash and or euronet common stock to be provided to the sellers of ria upon the assumed settlement of the cvrs and sars during october  and additional consideration to be settled in cash or euronet common stock that we may have to pay during and in connection with the acquisition of brodos  totaling up to million 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions 
for additional information on capital and operating lease obligations  see note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total liability for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin was million as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  however  at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which the actual results will emerge over time 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for computing income taxes  estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired in acquisitions  and revenue recognition 
we base base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies and estimates are forward looking statements and are impacted significantly by estimates and should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements 
accounting for income taxes the deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards  and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity s  or group of entities  ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period  in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note  taxes  to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   partially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income in each country in which we operate  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  if we have a history of generating taxable income in a certain country in which we operate  and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in this country  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we expect to realize 
additionally  effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin  which is intended to reduce the diversity associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition related to accounting for income taxes 
fin requires substantial management judgment and use of estimates in determining whether the impact of a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit by the relevant taxing authority 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
it is reasonably possible that amounts reserved for potential exposure could change significantly as a result of the conclusion of tax examinations and  accordingly  materially affect our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the acquisition purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired is supported by valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management 
for larger or more complex acquisitions  management engages an appraiser to assist in the valuation 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of million and acquired intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and whenever events or circumstances dictate  we test for impairment 
impairment tests are performed annually during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level 
generally  fair value represents discounted projected future cash flows and potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
our annual impairment tests during the years  and indicated that there were no impairments 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant management judgment in estimating future cash flows and assessing potential market and economic conditions 
it is reasonably possible that our operations will not perform as expected  or that estimates or assumption could change  which may result in the recording of material non cash impairment charges during the year in which these changes take place 
see impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted below for discussion regarding issuance of sfas no 
r  business combinations  that will be effective for acquisitions we complete after january  impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the respective asset 
the same estimates are also used in planning for our long and short range business planning and forecasting 
we assess the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
assets to be disposed are required to be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are required to be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
reviewing long lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment 
estimating the future cash flows requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenues are comprised of monthly recurring management fees and transaction based fees that are recognized when the transactions are processed or the services are performed 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for monthly management fees and transaction based fees  we consider the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as principle versus net as an agent  eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and other various interpretations 
certain of our noncancelable customer contracts provide for the receipt of up front fees paid to or received from the customer and or decreasing or increasing fee schedules over the agreement term for substantially the same level of services provided by the company 
as prescribed by sab and sab  we recognize revenue under these contracts based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
we also record certain revenues in the eft processing segment related to the sale of eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems  including professional fees for implementation and customization  ongoing software maintenance and associated computer hardware 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for these items  in addition to sab  sab  and eitf  we also consider the guidance contained in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
applying us gaap revenue recognition guidance to the software business requires more detailed knowledge of the rules and is subject to more complex judgment 
for the year ended december   revenues from software and software related products and services represented of our total consolidated revenues 
substantial management judgment and estimation is required in determining the proper revenue recognition methodology for our various revenue producing activities  as well as the proper and consistent application of our determined methodology 
subsequent events during  in connection with our interest to acquire moneygram  we purchased million shares of moneygram common stock at a cost basis of million 
subsequent to december   the market price of moneygram common stock declined significantly 
based on trading prices for moneygram common stock on february   the value of the company s investment decreased to million 
on february   we decided not to submit a proposal to acquire moneygram 
in connection with this decision  we expect to record expense before income tax benefit of approximately million to million during the first quarter  representing the decline in value of moneygram stock  together with acquisition related expenses 
the actual loss could be larger if the market price of moneygram common stock deteriorates further 
impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted during  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement applies whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning in the first quarter  however  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as deferred financing costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning in the first quarter  however  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which is a revision of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
r will apply to all business combinations and will require most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas no r will also require transaction related costs to be expensed in the period incurred  rather than capitalizing these costs as a component of the respective purchase price 
sfas no 
r is effective for acquisitions that we may complete after january  and early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption will have a significant impact on the accounting treatment for acquisitions occurring after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  that replaces accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which will change the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
sfas no 
is effective for euronet on january  and will result in a change in the classification of noncontrolling interest from a component of liabilities to a component of equity in consolidated balance sheets and will change the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling shareholders after the effective date 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued sab  certain assumptions used in valuation methods  which extends the use of the simplified method  under certain circumstances  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
prior to sab  sab stated that the simplified method was only available for grants made up to december  because we have primarily utilized restricted stock since the beginning of  the expected term has been an insignificant component of the amount of recorded share based compensation 
however  for future grants of stock options  if any  should the historical experience regarding the expected term of granted stock options be considered insufficient for estimating future expected terms  we may continue to use the simplified method for determining the expected term in situations allowed by sab management is still analyzing the potential impact of the adoption of sab  however  the impact on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material 
forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the following our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business  the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans  the assumptions underlying our business plans  business strategy  government regulatory action  technological advances  or projected costs and revenues 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those referred to above and as set forth in item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in connection with completing the acquisition of ria during the second quarter  we entered into a million secured syndicated credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility  which accrue interest at variable rates 
this revolving credit facility replaces our million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility may be expanded by up to an additional million in term loans and up to an additional million for the revolving line of credit  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
this facility substantially increases our interest rate risk 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was million 
of this amount  million  or of our total debt obligations  relates to contingent convertible debentures having fixed coupon rates 
our million contingent convertible debentures  issued in october  accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
the million contingent convertible debentures  issued in december accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
based on quoted market prices  as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate convertible debentures was million  compared to a carrying value of million 
through the use of interest rate swap agreements covering the period from june  to may   an additional million of our variable rate term debt  or of our total debt  has been effectively converted to a fixed rate of 
as of december   the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap agreements was million 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  for our total million in fixed rate debt totals approximately million per year  or a weighted average interest rate of annually 
additionally  approximately million  or of our total debt obligations  relate to capitalized leases with fixed payment and interest terms that expire between and the remaining million  or of our total debt obligations  relates to debt that accrues interest at variable rates 
if we were to maintain these borrowings  and borrow the remaining million currently available under the revolving credit facility  a increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional annualized interest expense of approximately million 
for more information regarding our debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
our excess cash is invested in instruments with original maturities of three months or less  therefore  as investments mature and are reinvested  the amount we earn will increase or decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   of our revenues were generated in non us dollar countries compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from non us dollar countries  compared to the prior year is due primarily to the second quarter acquisition of ria  as well as increased revenues of our us based prepaid processing segment operations 
we expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the us dollar 
we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar to the currencies of countries in which we have significant operations 
we estimate that  depending on the net foreign currency working capital position at a selected point in time  a fluctuation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined annualized effect on reported net income and working capital of up to approximately million 
this effect is estimated by segregating revenues  expenses and working capital by currency and applying a currency depreciation and appreciation to the non us dollar amounts 
we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
because a majority of our revenues and expenses are incurred in the functional currencies of our international operating entities  the profits we earn in foreign currencies have been positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar in and additionally  our debt obligations are primarily in us dollars  therefore  as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  the amount available for repayment of debt will also increase or decrease 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our money transfer segment 
a majority of the money transfer business involves receiving and disbursing different currencies  in which we earn a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
this spread provides some protection against currency fluctuations that occur while we are holding the foreign currency 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is limited by the fact that disbursement occurs for the majority of transactions shortly after they are initiated 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to help offset foreign currency exposure related to the notional value of money transfer transactions collected in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   we had foreign currency derivative instruments  primarily forward contracts  outstanding with a notional value of million  primarily in euros that were not designated as hedges and mature in a weighted average of five days 
the fair value of these forward contracts as of december  was an unrealized loss of approximately million  which was mostly offset by the unrealized gain on the related foreign currency receivables
