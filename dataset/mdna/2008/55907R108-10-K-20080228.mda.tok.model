item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during  mmp acquired certain pipeline and terminal assets  which had a significant impact on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
our operating results incorporate a number of significant estimates and uncertainties 
such matters could cause the data included herein not to be indicative of our future financial conditions or results of operations 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under item of this report 
in addition  a discussion of our environmental liabilities and indemnifications can be found in item business environmental safety  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we define ebitda  which is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  in the following schedules as net income plus provision for income taxes  debt prepayment premium  write off of unamortized debt placement fees  debt placement fee amortization  interest expense net of interest income and interest capitalized  non controlling owners interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries and depreciation and amortization and excluding non cash gains on derivative instruments 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda excludes some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
our management uses ebitda as a performance measure to assess the viability of projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income  the nearest comparable gaap measure  is included in the following schedules 
in addition to ebitda  the non gaap measure of operating margin in the aggregate and by segment is presented in the following tables 
we compute the components of operating margin by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the following tables 
see note segment disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating margin to segment operating profit 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important measure of the economic performance of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate mmp s capital resources between segments 
operating profit  alternatively  includes expense items such as depreciation and amortization and affiliate g a expense  that management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation 
in  commercial and operating responsibilities for mmp s two inland terminals in the dallas  texas area were transferred from the petroleum products terminals segment to the petroleum products pipeline system segment

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we own and control mmp gp  which is the general partner of mmp  a publicly traded limited partnership 
mmp is principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products 
our only cash generating asset is our ownership interest in mmp s general partner  which owns the following the general partner interest in mmp  which currently entitles us to receive approximately of the cash distributed by mmp  and of the incentive distribution rights in mmp  which entitles us to receive increasing percentages  up to a maximum of  of any incremental cash distributed by mmp as certain target distribution levels are reached in excess of per mmp unit in any quarter 
since we own and control mmp gp  we reflect our ownership interest in mmp on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with mmp gp s and mmp s financial results 
the publicly held limited partner interests in mmp are reflected as non controlling owners interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries in our results of operations 
we currently have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by mmp  and our operating cash flow will be derived solely from cash distributions from mmp 
our consolidated financial statements do not differ materially from the results of operations of mmp 
accordingly  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of mmp 
please read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  significant events sale of units by mgg mh 
in april  we entered into a common unit purchase agreement the purchase agreement in connection with the direct sale of million common units the purchased units representing limited partner interests in us by mgg mh to a number of purchasers the purchasers 
we did not receive any of the proceeds of this sale 
this transaction reduced mgg mh s ownership in our limited partner units from to 
in this purchase agreement  we made certain representations and warranties to the purchasers regarding the validity of the common units and the status of our partnership 
also in april  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers of the common units the registration rights agreement as required by the purchase agreement 
the registration rights agreement required us to file a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec by june   providing for the resale from time to time of the purchased units held by the purchasers 
the required registration statement was filed with the sec prior to june   and was declared effective on june  the registration rights agreement contains provisions which allow us  under certain circumstances  the right to delay the purchasers from selling their common units  however  this delay right is limited to days in any day period and days in any day period 
in addition  in april  we entered into an indemnification agreement dated april  the indemnification agreement with mgg mh  which expires on april  under the indemnification agreement  mgg mh agreed to indemnify us for one half of any obligations  subject to a million cap  we may incur related to the registration statement not being available for more than days in any day period or days in any day period 
mgg mh also agreed to retain unencumbered net assets sufficient to cover these indemnification obligations 
further  the registration rights agreement contains certain provisions which grant certain of the purchasers the right to join us  or piggyback  if we are selling our common units in a primary offering or another party s common units in a secondary offering  so long as the managing underwriter agrees that a piggyback secondary offering of the common units will not have an adverse effect on the offering of common units 
all of our registration obligations under the registration rights agreement  excluding the piggyback rights  expire on april  the piggyback rights expire april  in september  mgg mh sold million of our common units in a secondary offering 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from this sale 
this offering was made pursuant to the current shelf registration statement and supplemental prospectus filed by us with the sec 
this transaction reduced mgg mh s limited partner ownership interest in us from to 
recent developments distribution 
during january  the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the period of october through december  the per unit distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february  interest rate derivatives 
in january  mmp entered into a total of million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against variability of future interest payments on debt that it anticipates issuing no later than june proceeds of the anticipated debt issuance will be used to refinance borrowings on mmp s revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap agreements have a year term 
the effective date of the agreements is june   at which time the agreements require a mandatory cash settlement 
assuming no changes in swap spreads between the date mmp entered these agreements and the date on which they are settled  these agreements will effectively fix the rate on the treasury component of mmp s anticipated debt issuance at approximately 
assignment of supply agreement 
as part of its acquisition of a pipeline system in october  mmp assumed a third party supply agreement 
under this agreement  which expires in  mmp is obligated to supply approximately  barrels of petroleum products per month to one of its customers 
as a result  the magnitude of mmp s product sales revenues and product purchases increased substantially beginning in late the gross margin mmp realizes from this agreement can be substantially higher in periods when refined petroleum product prices are increasing and substantially lower in periods when product prices are declining given that mmp follows an average inventory valuation methodology  which results in each period s product purchases being influenced by the value of products held in that period s beginning inventory 
during february  mmp entered into an agreement to assign this supply obligation to a third party entity effective march  mmp will continue to earn transportation revenues for the product it ships related to this supply agreement but will no longer recognize associated product sales and purchases 
however  mmp will share in a portion of the assignor s trading profits or losses relating to the assigned product supply agreement  but it will not be required to fund inventory requirements 
as of december   mmp held inventory valued at million for the third party supply agreement 
upon the march  effective date  mmp will sell any remaining inventory to the assignor and recognize the resulting gain or loss based on inventory values on that date 
the impact of this supply agreement on mmp s historical financial results not including transportation revenues for products shipped associated with the products supply agreement is provided in the table below in millions year ended december  product sales revenues product purchases amortization of liability a ad valorem taxes total a when mmp assumed the supply agreement in october  mmp recorded its fair value as a liability  which it has been amortizing to product sales revenues over the contract term 
the balance of the products supply agreement liability at december  was million 
this liability will be written off on march  when mmp assigns the supply agreement to a third party entity 
the new agreement requires mmp to share in a portion of the assignor s trading profits and losses  therefore  mmp will record a liability of approximately million associated with this new agreement 
the fair value of this liability will be determined by using probability weighted discounted estimated cash flows 
mmp expects to recognize the difference of approximately million as a gain in the first quarter of in the event the third party entity assuming this obligation is unable to perform on this agreement through the expiration date  the supply agreement obligation will revert back to mmp 
overview mmp s petroleum products pipeline system and petroleum products terminals generate substantially all of its cash flows from the transportation  storage and distribution services mmp provides to its customers 
the revenues generated from these petroleum products businesses are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products 
operating expenses are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on mmp s pipeline and stored in its terminals 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
for further discussion of indemnified environmental matters  see business environmental safety under item of this annual report on form k 
a prolonged period of high refined product prices could lead to a reduction in demand and result in lower shipments on mmp s pipeline system and reduced demand for its terminal services 
in addition  fluctuations in the prices of refined petroleum products impact the amount of cash mmp s petroleum products pipeline system generates from its third party supply agreement and its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations 
please read recent developments above for discussion of mmp s recent assignment of this third party supply agreement to another company 
in addition  increased maintenance regulations  higher power costs and higher interest rates could decrease the amount of cash mmp generates 
see item a 
risk factors for other risk factors that could impact mmp s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
petroleum products pipeline system 
mmp s petroleum products pipeline system is comprised of a common carrier pipeline that provides transportation  storage and distribution services for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gases in states from texas through the midwest to colorado  north dakota  minnesota  wisconsin and illinois 
through direct refinery connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines  mmp s petroleum products pipeline system can access more than of the refinery capacity in the continental united states 
in  the pipeline generated more than of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all interstate transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the pipeline also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing 
in general  mmp does not take title to the products that it transports 
however  mmp does take title to products related to its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations  its third party supply agreement and product overages on its pipeline system 
please read recent developments above for discussion of mmp s recent assignment of this third party supply agreement to a third party entity  thus eliminating mmp s need to carry inventory to satisfy this agreement effective march although mmp s petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and third party supply agreement generate significant revenues  mmp believes the gross margin from these activities  which takes into account the related product purchases  better represents its importance to mmp s results of operations 
petroleum products terminals 
mmp s petroleum products terminals segment is comprised of marine and inland terminals  which store and distribute gasoline and other petroleum products throughout states 
mmp s marine terminals are large storage and distribution terminals that have marine access and in some cases are strategically located near major refining hubs along the us gulf and east coasts and principally serve refiners and large end users of petroleum products 
mmp earns revenues at its marine facilities primarily from storage and throughput fees 
mmp s inland terminals are part of a distribution network located principally throughout the southeastern united states 
these inland terminals are connected to large  third party interstate pipelines and are utilized by retail suppliers  wholesalers and marketers to transfer gasoline and other petroleum products from these pipelines to trucks  railcars or barges for delivery to their final destination 
mmp earns revenues at its inland terminals primarily from fees charged based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these locations and from ancillary services such as additive injections 
ammonia pipeline system 
mmp s ammonia pipeline system transports and distributes ammonia from production facilities in texas and oklahoma to various distribution points in the midwest for use as an agricultural fertilizer 
mmp generates revenues principally from volume based fees for the transportation of ammonia on its pipeline system 
a third party pipeline company has operated mmp s ammonia pipeline system since february  but mmp plans to assume operating responsibility of this pipeline system on july  operating costs and expenses are principally fixed costs related to field personnel and maintenance 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on the pipeline 
mmp does not expect any material increase in its operating expenses in as a result of its assuming operating responsibility of the ammonia pipeline 
growth projects mmp remains focused on growth and has significantly increased its operations over the past two years through organic growth projects that expand or upgrade its existing facilities 
industry themes continue to drive mmp s current expansion projects  including increased storage demand with significant opportunity to build tankage  backed by long term customer commitments  government regulations for renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel as fuel additives  which require mmp to add infrastructure on which it will earn additional profits  refinery expansions in the mid continent and gulf coast regions  which require additional pipeline capacity to deliver the increased production  and connectivity to key growth markets such as denver  colorado and dallas and houston  texas 
mmp spent million on organic growth projects during and million in further  mmp expects to spend approximately million in on projects that are currently underway  with additional spending of million expected in and million in to complete these projects 
these expansion capital estimates exclude potential acquisitions or spending on more than million of other potential growth projects in earlier stages of development 
results of our operations the results of our operations discussed below principally reflect the activities of mmp 
because our financial statements consolidate the results of mmp  our financial statements are substantially similar to mmp s 
the differences in our financial statements primarily include the following adjustments to the income statement interest of non controlling owners in mmp 
our consolidated balance sheet includes non controlling owners interest of consolidated subsidiaries that reflect the proportion of mmp owned by its partners other than us 
similarly  the ownership interests in mmp held by its partners other than us are reflected in our consolidated income statement as non controlling owners interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries 
these balance sheet and income statement categories are not reflected on mmp s financial statements  fair value adjustments to mmp s assets and liabilities 
our june acquisition of interests in mmp was recorded as a purchase business combination 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to the historical cost reflected on mmp s balance sheet for the fair value of our proportionate share of mmp s assets and liabilities at the time of our acquisition 
these fair value adjustments further result in certain differences between our income statement and mmp s income statement  as the depreciation  amortization  accretion or write off of certain assets and liabilities is based on different values  our capital structure 
in addition to incorporating the assets and liabilities of mmp  the partners capital on our balance sheet represents our partners capital as opposed to the capital reflected on mmp s balance sheet  which reflects the ownership interests of all of its partners  including its owners other than us  non cash interest income 
during may  we and mmp entered into an indemnification settlement with a former affiliate  which is discussed in more detail under environmental below 
we recorded a receivable from this former affiliate on our consolidated balance sheet in connection with this indemnification settlement at its discounted present value  and we recorded the accretion of the discount from may through june as interest income on our consolidated income statement 
these items were not reflected on mmp s financial statements  except that mmp recorded a capital contribution from us when payments pursuant to the indemnification settlement were made to mmp by this former affiliate  and our g a expenses 
we incur general and administrative g a expenses that are independent from mmp s operations and are not reflected on mmp s consolidated financial statements 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin  which is presented in the tables below  is an important measure used by mmp s management to evaluate the economic performance of mmp s core operations 
this measure forms the basis of mmp s internal financial reporting and is used by its management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  but the components of operating margin are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the tables below 
operating profit includes expense items  such as depreciation and amortization and affiliate g a costs  which management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  variance year ended december  favorable unfavorable change change financial highlights in millions  except operating statistics revenues transportation and terminals revenues petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system intersegment eliminations total transportation and terminals revenues product sales affiliate management fees total revenues operating expenses petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system intersegment eliminations total operating expenses product purchases equity earnings operating margin depreciation and amortization affiliate g a expense operating profit operating statistics petroleum products pipeline system transportation revenue per barrel shipped volume shipped million barrels petroleum products terminals marine terminal average storage utilized million barrels per month inland terminal throughput million barrels ammonia pipeline system volume shipped thousand tons transportation and terminals revenues increased by million resulting from higher revenues for each of mmp s business segments as shown below an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million 
transportation revenues increased as a result of higher average tariffs due in part to mmp s mid year and tariff escalations  partially offset by slightly lower transportation volumes due to various factors which resulted in several refineries connected to mmp s system curtailing production during the current year 
mmp also earned more ancillary revenues related to higher fees for leased storage as well as additional demand for its terminal  additive and renewable fuels services during  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million due to higher revenues at both mmp s marine and inland terminals 
marine revenues increased primarily due to operating results from expansion projects  such as construction of additional storage tanks at mmp s galena park  texas facility that were placed into service beginning in late and throughout  and more revenue from additive services and higher storage rates 
the revenue increase at mmp s marine terminals was partially offset by lower revenue recognized from variable rate storage agreements in revenues from these agreements are based on mmp s share of its customer s net trading profits earned during the agreement term and are recognized at the end of that term 
mmp s results benefitted from shared profits from two variable rate storage agreements whereas the period benefitted from only one contract 
inland terminal revenues also increased in from record throughput volumes as well as higher additive fees  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million primarily due to higher average tariffs 
operating expenses increased by million as higher expenses at mmp s petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system were partially offset by lower costs related to its petroleum products pipeline system as described below a decrease in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million primarily due to more favorable product overages which reduce operating expenses  lower integrity spending because of maintenance project timing and lower environmental expenses 
during the period  mmp recognized additional expense when it entered into a risk transfer agreement  whereby risk associated with certain known environmental sites was transferred to a contractor in order to mitigate mmp s future financial exposure relative to those sites 
higher property taxes  asset retirements  power and personnel costs in partially offset these favorable expense items  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million primarily related to higher personnel costs  in part due to expansion projects  timing of maintenance projects and product downgrade charges resulting from the accidental degradation of small amounts of product during  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million primarily due to increased environmental accruals related to a pipeline release and higher system integrity costs 
mmp expects the amount of system integrity spending to decline significantly on the ammonia pipeline system during the latter part of as it completes the work necessary for the high consequence area testing mandated by federal regulations 
product sales revenues primarily resulted from a third party product supply agreement  mmp s petroleum products blending operation  system product gains and transmix fractionation 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december  while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the increase in margins was primarily attributable to higher product prices 
the gross margin realized on these activities can be substantially higher in periods when refined petroleum prices increase and substantially lower in periods when product prices decline or stabilize given that mmp follows an average inventory valuation methodology which results in each period s product purchases being influenced by the value of products held in that period s beginning inventory 
please read recent developments above for discussion of mmp s recent assignment of the third party supply agreement effective march  thus eliminating its need to carry inventory to satisfy this agreement 
operating margin increased million  primarily due to higher revenues from each of mmp s business segments and higher gross margin from product sales in depreciation and amortization increased by million related to capital expansion projects over the past year 
affiliate g a expense increased by million between periods primarily due to higher personnel costs during for the years ended december  and  mmp was responsible for paying g a costs of million and million  respectively 
we reimburse mmp for their actual cash g a costs that exceed these amounts 
the amount of g a we reimbursed to mmp for the years ended and was million and million  respectively 
mgg mh reimburses us for all amounts of g a costs we reimburse to mmp 
based on our g a agreement and assuming no acquisitions or divestitures that would result in adjustments to the upper and lower cap amounts  the maximum amount of g a reimbursements we expect to pay to mmp during will be million 
we expect will be the last year we will reimburse mmp for g a costs under this agreement 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized and interest income  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our average consolidated debt outstanding  excluding fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges  increased to million during from million during however  the weighted average interest rate on consolidated borrowings  after giving effect to the impact of associated fair value hedges  decreased to for the period from for the period primarily due to the refinancing of mmp s pipeline notes during second quarter at a lower interest rate 
the amount of interest capitalized increased due to the higher level of capital spending over the last year  however  this increase was largely offset by lower interest income recognized related to the indemnification settlement  which was fully paid in june non controlling owners interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  primarily related to higher mmp net income 
mmp recognized debt refinancing expenses of million during the period with no similar expense in these expenses were associated with the early retirement of mmp s pipeline notes during second quarter  originally due in october  and included a debt prepayment premium of million as well as related interest rate hedge settlements of million  which were recorded as other expense 
provision for income taxes was million during compared to in beginning in  the state of texas implemented a partnership level tax based on the financial results of mmp s assets apportioned to the state of texas

transportation and terminals revenues increased by million resulting from higher revenues for each of mmp s business segments as shown below an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million primarily attributable to record annual shipments due to higher diesel fuel and gasoline shipments as a result of increased demand from mmp s customers and a higher average transportation rate per barrel shipped  principally related to its mid year tariff increase 
mmp also earned more ancillary revenues related to additive and terminal services during  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million due to higher revenues at both mmp s marine and inland terminals 
mmp s marine terminal revenues increased due to its wilmington  delaware marine terminal  which was acquired in september  revenue from two variable rate storage agreements benefiting results as well as higher storage rates  additive fees and expansion projects 
revenues also increased at mmp s inland terminals due to higher additive fees and throughput volumes  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million due to higher tariffs associated with mmp s new transportation agreements  which became effective july   and increased volumes 
operating expenses increased by million 
each of mmp s business segments incurred additional expenses as follows an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  primarily due to system integrity spending for pipeline testing and personnel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by more favorable product overages in the current period  which reduce operating expenses  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million primarily related to expenses associated with mmp s wilmington marine terminal  which it acquired in september  and higher power and personnel costs at its other terminals  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million primarily related to higher system integrity costs and environmental expenses 
product sales revenues primarily resulted from mmp s third party product supply agreement  petroleum products blending operation  system product gains and transmix fractionation 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the gross margin increase in primarily resulted from the impact of high gasoline prices on mmp s petroleum products blending operation  partially offset by lower margin from the third party supply agreement primarily due to a lower weighted average inventory cost from that favorably impacted results 
the gross margin mmp realizes on these activities can be substantially higher in periods when refined petroleum prices increase and substantially lower in periods when product prices decline or stabilize given that mmp follows an average inventory valuation methodology which results in each period s product purchases being influenced by the value of products held in that period s beginning inventory 
operating margin increased million  primarily due to revenues from a marine terminal variable rate storage agreement  incremental operating results from mmp s recently acquired wilmington marine facility and improved utilization and financial results from mmp s other assets 
depreciation and amortization increased by million related to mmp s asset acquisitions and capital expansion projects over the past year 
affiliate g a expense increased by million 
this increase was primarily related to i our incremental costs associated with being a public company since february  ii expense we recognized associated with certain distribution payments made over the past three years by mgg midstream holdings  lp to an executive officer of mmp gp  who left the company during the fourth quarter of  and iii mmp s equity based compensation program  which impacted g a expenses by million during and million during the higher compensation expense resulted from the increase in mmp s unit price during the current period and increases in the number of units management estimates will vest under this equity based incentive compensation program 
g a expenses also were higher during due to higher employee costs and additional personnel hired to help manage mmp s expansion projects 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  primarily due to lower average debt balances during the current period 
average consolidated debt outstanding  excluding fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges  decreased to million during from  million during primarily due to the retirement of our term loan in december the weighted average interest rate on consolidated borrowings  after giving effect to the impact of associated fair value hedges  increased to for the period from for the period primarily due to rising interest rates 
the amount of capitalized interest in the current period associated with mmp s capital spending program also increased  further reducing the net interest expense in interest income was million during compared to million in  a decline of million  primarily as a result of our and mmp s lower cash balances and our lower imputed interest income recognized on smaller amounts to be received pursuant to the may indemnification settlement 
we continued to recognize imputed interest income on amounts due under this settlement through june  when the final scheduled payment was received 
non controlling owners interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  primarily related to higher mmp net income 
while we had no refinancing costs in  the period included million of write offs of unamortized debt placement fees associated with refinancing our debt during june then retiring it during december net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or

in addition  mmp spent million to buy out of obligations related to a portion of its third party supply agreement and million for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  which included million for maintenance capital and million for expansion capital 
these cash expenditures were partially offset by sales of marketable securities which  net of purchases  generated million of cash in net cash used by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used during reflects million of distributions by us to our unitholders and million of distributions by mmp to its owners other than us  partially offset by net borrowings on mmp s revolving credit facility of million and million from a debt financing 
a portion of these borrowings were used to repay the remaining balance of million of mmp s pipeline notes 
cash used during primarily reflects million of distributions by us to our owners and unitholders and million of distributions by mmp to its owners other than us  partially offset by million of net proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash used during primarily reflects million of distributions by us to our owners and million of distributions by mmp to its owners other than us  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of our remaining mmp limited partner units 
borrowings and a capital contribution to us from mgg mh of million that funded the retirement of our outstanding debt more than offset debt payments during in february  we received a quarterly distribution of million related to our ownership of the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in mmp associated with the fourth quarter of as a result  in february we paid a quarterly distribution of for each of our limited partner units for the fourth quarter of if we continue to pay cash distributions at this current level and the number of outstanding units remain the same  total cash distributions of million will be paid to our unitholders in capital requirements historically  we have not had any material capital requirements separate from those of mmp  and we do not expect to in the future 
mmp s businesses require continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
capital spending for mmp s businesses consists primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and expansion capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow mmp s business and to expand or upgrade its existing facilities  which we refer to as organic growth projects 
organic growth projects include capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
during  mmp s net maintenance capital spending was million  excluding million of spending that would have been covered by indemnifications settled in may and million mmp has received from insurance reimbursements 
mmp has received the entire million under its indemnification settlement agreement 
please see environmental below for additional description of this agreement 
for  mmp expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures for its existing businesses of approximately million  excluding million of maintenance capital that has already been reimbursed to us through our indemnification settlement and third party reimbursements 
in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  mmp also incurs expansion capital expenditures at its existing facilities 
during  mmp spent cash of approximately million for organic growth projects 
based on projects currently underway or in advanced stages of development  mmp currently plans to spend million on organic growth capital in  excluding potential acquisitions  and approximately million in and million in to complete these projects 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity for funding interest payments  operating expenses and obligations to mmp is cash distributions we receive from mmp 
additional liquidity is available under our affiliate working capital loan agreement described below 
cash generated from operations is mmp s primary source of liquidity for funding debt service  maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions 
additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions is available through borrowings under mmp s revolving credit facility discussed below  as well as from other borrowings or issuances of debt or limited partner units 
if capital markets do not permit mmp to issue additional debt and equity  its business may be adversely affected and mmp may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses or fund organic growth projects 
as of december   total debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet was million 
the difference between this amount and the million face value of our outstanding debt is adjustments related to fair value hedges and unamortized discounts on debt issuances 
our debt as of december   we had no debt outstanding other than mmp s debt  which is consolidated on our financial statements 
affiliate working capital loan 
in february  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with mgg mh as the lender  which matured on december  during both and  we entered into agreements with mgg mh with similar terms that matured or will mature at the end of each respective year 
the facility is available exclusively to fund our working capital borrowings 
borrowings  if any  under the facility bear interest at libor plus  and we pay a commitment fee to mgg mh on the unused portion of the working capital facility of 
borrowings under this facility are non recourse to our general partner 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at any time during mmp debt the face value of mmp s debt outstanding as of december  was million 
the difference between the face value and carrying value of mmp s debt outstanding was amounts recorded for discounts incurred on debt issuances and market value adjustments to long term debt associated with qualifying hedges 
at december   maturities of mmp s debt were as follows each year in   and  million in  and million thereafter 
mmp s debt is non recourse to its general partner and to us 
revolving credit facility 
in september  mmp amended and restated its revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million and extend the maturity date from may to september borrowings under the facility remain unsecured and incur interest at libor plus a spread that ranges from to based on mmp s credit ratings and amounts outstanding under the facility 
borrowings under this facility are used primarily for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
net borrowings under this revolver during were million 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  and million of the facility was obligated for letters of credit 
the obligations for letters of credit are not reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  was 
additionally  a commitment fee is assessed at a rate from to  depending on mmp s credit rating

in addition to certain financial ratio covenants  these covenants limit mmp s ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness secured by certain liens  encumber its assets  make certain investments  engage in certain sale leaseback transactions and consolidate  merge or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets 
mmp was in compliance with these covenants as of december  the revolving credit facility and notes described above are senior indebtedndess 
interest rate derivatives 
mmp utilizes interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
in october  mmp entered into a million interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of mmp s senior notes due this agreement effectively changes the interest rate on million of those notes to a floating rate of six month libor plus  with libor set in arrears 
this swap agreement expires on october   the maturity date of the senior notes

for purposes of this table  we have assumed that the borrowings under mmp s revolving credit facility as of december  million will not be repaid until the maturity date of the facility in september the interest obligation for borrowings under mmp s variable rate revolving credit facility assumes the borrowings outstanding at december  will remain outstanding until the maturity date of that facility 
the interest obligation further assumes the weighted average borrowing rate of the facility at december  mmp has an agreement with mgg gp to provide its direct operating and g a services 
this agreement has provisions for termination upon day notice by either party 
as a result of the termination provisions of this agreement and the requirement by mmp to pay only actual costs as they are incurred  we are unable to determine the actual amount of these commitments 
the amount mmp paid for allocated operating and g a costs during was million 
mmp has an agreement to supply a customer with up to approximately  barrels of petroleum products per month until the agreement expires in related to this agreement  mmp has entered into a separate buy or make whole agreement with a supplier for  barrels of petroleum products per day through may  under the terms of this buy or make whole agreement  if mmp does not purchase all of the barrels specified in the agreement  mmp s supplier will sell the deficiency barrels in the open market 
mmp is required to reimburse its supplier for any amounts in which they sell these deficiency barrels at prices lower than specified in our buy or make whole agreement 
we have not included any amounts in the table above for this commitment because mmp is unable to determine what the amounts  if any  of that commitment might be 
on december   mmp had outstanding interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the fair value of million of its long term debt 
because future cash outflows under this derivative agreement  if any  are uncertain  they have been excluded from this table 
represents the grant date fair value of mmp unit awards accounted for as equity plus the december  fair value of mmp award grants accounted for as liabilities  based on when those outstanding award grants will be settled 
settlements of these awards will differ from these reported amounts primarily due to differences between actual and current estimates of payout percentages and changes in mmp s unit price between december  and the vesting dates of the awards 
on december   mmp entered into a year agreement to reach contractual endpoint as defined in the agreement for remediation sites 
this contract obligates mmp to pay the remediation costs incurred by the contract counterparty associated with these sites up to a maximum of million 
the amounts in the table above include the estimated remaining amounts to be paid under this agreement million as of december  and the estimated timing of these payments 
additionally  this agreement requires mmp to pay the contract counter party a performance bonus if the remediation sites are brought to contractual end point for less than million 
the table above includes our estimate of the performance bonus million as of december  during  mmp entered into a separate year agreement with an independent contractor to remediate certain of its environmental sites 
this contract obligated mmp to pay million over a year period 
the amounts in the table above include the remaining amounts to be paid under this agreement million as of december  and the estimated timing of those payments based on project progress to date 
this deposit is security for payment performance related to mmp s product supply agreement 
environmental mmp s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
mmp has accrued liabilities for estimated costs at its facilities and properties 
under its accounting policies  mmp records liabilities when environmental costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of amounts recorded for environmental liabilities involves significant judgments and assumptions by management 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in determining environmental liabilities  it is reasonably possible that the actual amounts required to extinguish these liabilities could be materially different from those mmp has recognized 
indemnification settlement 
prior to may  a former affiliate provided indemnifications to mmp for assets mmp had acquired from it 
in may  mmp entered into an agreement with its former affiliate under which its former affiliate agreed to pay mmp million to release it from those indemnification obligations  which mmp has collected 
as of december   known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were million 
through december   mmp has spent million of the indemnification settlement proceeds for indemnified matters  including million of capital costs 
mmp has not reserved the cash received from this indemnity settlement but has used it for its various other cash needs  including expansion capital spending 
petroleum products epa issue 
in july  the environmental protection agency epa  pursuant to section of the clean water act the act  served an information request to mmp s former affiliate with regard to petroleum discharges from its pipeline operations 
that inquiry primarily focused on the petroleum products pipeline system that mmp subsequently acquired 
the response to the epa s information request was submitted during november in march  mmp received an additional information request from the epa and notice from the us department of justice doj that the epa had requested the doj to initiate a lawsuit alleging violations of section b of the act in regards to releases 
the doj stated that the maximum statutory penalty for the releases was in excess of million  which assumed that all releases are violations of the act and that the epa would impose the maximum penalty 
the epa further indicated that some of those releases may have also violated the spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of section j of the act and that additional penalties may be assessed 
in addition  mmp may incur additional costs associated with these releases if the epa were to successfully seek and obtain injunctive relief 
mmp responded to the march information request in a timely manner and has entered into an agreement that provides both parties an opportunity to negotiate a settlement prior to initiating litigation 
mmp has accrued an amount for this matter based on its best estimates that is less than million 
most of the amount mmp has accrued was included as part of the environmental indemnification settlement mmp reached with its former affiliate see indemnification settlement description below 
the doj and epa have added to their original demand a release that occurred in the second quarter of from mmp s petroleum products pipeline near its kansas city  kansas terminal and a release that occurred in the first quarter of from mmp s petroleum products pipeline near independence  kansas 
mmp s accrual includes these additional releases 
mmp is in ongoing negotiations with the epa  however  it is unable to determine what its ultimate liability could be for these matters 
adjustments to mmp s recorded liability  which could occur in the near term  could be material to mmp s and our results of operations and cash flows 
ammonia epa issue 
in february  mmp received notice from the doj that the epa had requested the doj to initiate a lawsuit alleging violations of sections and of the act with respect to two releases of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia pipeline owned by mmp and operated by a third party 
the doj stated that the maximum statutory penalty for alleged violations of the act for both releases combined was approximately million 
the doj also alleged that the third party operator of mmp s ammonia pipeline was liable for penalties pursuant to section of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act for failure to report the releases on a timely basis  with the statutory maximum for those penalties as high as million for which the third party operator has requested indemnification 
in march  mmp also received a demand from the third party operator for defense and indemnification in regards to a doj criminal investigation regarding whether certain actions or omissions of the third party operator constituted violations of federal criminal statutes 
the third party operator has subsequently settled this criminal investigation with the doj by paying a million fine 
mmp believes that it does not have an obligation to indemnify or defend the third party operator against the doj criminal investigations 
the doj stated in its notice to mmp that it does not expect mmp or the third party operator to pay the penalties at the statutory maximum  however  it may seek injunctive relief if the parties cannot agree on any necessary corrective actions 
mmp has accrued an amount for these matters based on its best estimates that is less than the maximum statutory penalties 
mmp is currently in discussions with the epa  doj and the third party operator regarding these two releases but is unable to determine what its ultimate liability could be for these matters 
adjustments to mmp s recorded liability  which could occur in the near term  could be material to mmp s and our results of operations and cash flows 
pcb impacts 
mmp has identified polychlorinated biphenyls pcb impacts at two of its petroleum products terminals that it is in the process of assessing 
it is possible that in the near term the pcb contamination levels could require corrective actions 
mmp is unable at this time to determine what these corrective actions and associated costs might be 
the costs of any corrective actions associated with these pcb impacts could be material to mmp s and our results of operations and cash flows 
floating roof emissions 
operational needs require mmp  at various times  to empty its tanks 
when mmp s tanks with internal floating roofs are emptied  the tanks emit petroleum vapors 
historically  these emissions were not reported or addressed in facility air permits because the epa had no approved method to quantify the emissions event 
however  the epa adopted the american petroleum institute s methodology for calculating these particular emissions as their approved standard in it is currently unclear what impact  if any  this adoption by the epa will have on mmp s current operational practices  emission control and reporting requirements  emission fees and existing air permits 
these impacts could be material to mmp s and our results of operations or cash flows 
other items pipeline tariff increase 
the ferc regulates the rates charged on interstate common carrier pipeline operations primarily through an index methodology  which establishes the maximum amount by which tariffs can be adjusted 
the current approved methodology is the annual change in the producer price index for finished goods ppi fg plus 
based on an actual change in ppi fg of approximately during  mmp increased virtually all of its published tariffs by the allowed adjustment of approximately effective july  the preliminary estimate for the change in ppi fg for is approximately 
once ppi fg is finalized  mmp expects to increase virtually all of its tariffs by the resulting ppi fg plus on july  ammonia operating agreement 
a third party pipeline company currently provides the operating services and a portion of the g a services for mmp s ammonia pipeline system under an operating agreement with it 
this pipeline company has provided notice to mmp that it will not renew its operating agreement with mmp upon its scheduled expiration date of june  mmp plans to assume operating responsibility of its ammonia pipeline at that time 
although mmp expects to incur transition costs during  we do not expect these incremental costs to have a material impact on mmp s or our financial results 
union contract negotiation 
approximately employees supporting mmp s petroleum products pipeline system are represented by the united steel workers union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement that extends through january mmp considers its labor relations to be good and expects to begin negotiations for a new contract during late unrecognized product gains 
mmp s petroleum products terminals operations generate product overages and shortages 
when mmp s petroleum products terminals experience net product shortages  mmp recognizes expense for those losses in the periods in which they occur 
when mmp s petroleum products terminals experience net product overages  mmp has product on hand for which it has no cost basis 
therefore  these net overages are not recognized in mmp s financial statements until the associated barrels are either sold or used to offset product losses 
the combined net unrecognized product overages for mmp s petroleum products terminals operations had a market value of approximately million as of december  however  the actual amounts mmp will recognize in future periods will depend on product prices at the time the associated barrels are either sold or used to offset future product losses 
impact of inflation inflation is a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and mmp s existing agreements  mmp has and will continue to pass through increased costs to its customers in the form of higher fees 
critical accounting estimates our management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed and approved these disclosures 
environmental liabilities the environmental liabilities we recognize on our consolidated balance sheets are related to mmp s operations  with certain fair value adjustments associated with our acquisition of a portion of mmp in june mmp estimates the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements 
we believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs is a critical accounting estimate for all three of mmp s operating segments because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next one to ten years  are subject to cost fluctuations and could change materially  as remediation work is performed and additional information relative to each specific site becomes known  cost estimates for those sites could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise  it is difficult to determine whether or not penalties may be levied by governmental agencies with regard to certain environmental events and  if so  the amounts of such penalties  and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations  which can be applied retroactively  could significantly increase the amount of our environmental liabilities 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into mmp s system integrity plan 
specifically  mmp s remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental sites associated with each of mmp s operating segments 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what actions will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the appropriate approach to remediation and to assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance consists of site investigation delineation  site remediation and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often does  include unknown variables that complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to completion 
at each accounting period end  mmp re evaluates its environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
changes in our environmental liabilities since december  were as follows in millions balance accruals expenditures amortization of fair value adjustment balance accruals expenditures amortization of fair value adjustment balance during  mmp increased its environmental liability accruals by million 
this increase was due to accrual increases related to pipeline product releases of million  changes in cost estimates of million and costs associated with a cost cap insurance policy of million  as a result of entering into a year agreement with an independent contractor to remediate a number of mmp s environmental sites 
the remainder of the accrual increase was primarily attributable to mmp s annual site assessment process 
mmp s accruals included million of liabilities it believes will be reimbursed by its insurance carriers 
during  mmp increased its environmental liability accruals by million 
the increase was due to changes in cost estimates associated with historical releases of million  accrual increases related to product releases which occurred in the current year of million and other accrual increases of million 
mmp s environmental liabilities at december  included million of amounts we believe will be reimbursed by mmp s insurance carriers and other third party entities 
mmp s environmental liabilities at december  are based on estimates that are subject to change  and any changes to these estimates would impact our results of operations and financial position 
for example  if mmp s environmental liabilities changed by as much as and assuming that this change was covered by items included in the may indemnification settlement  our operating expenses would change by million 
because our income taxes consist only of mmp s income apportioned to the state of texas  changes to our income tax expense would be minimal  therefore  operating profit and net income would change by approximately million  which represents a change of of our operating profit and of our net income for such a change reduced both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately per unit 
such a change would not materially impact our liabilities or equity 
further  the impact of such a change in our environmental costs would likely not affect mmp s liquidity because it would still comply with the covenants of its long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment consist primarily of pipeline  pipeline related equipment  storage tanks and terminal facility equipment 
property  plant and equipment are generally stated at cost except for impaired assets 
impaired assets are recorded at fair value on the last impairment evaluation date for which an adjustment was required 
when we acquired our interest in mmp in june  we recorded mmp s property  plant and equipment at our ownership interest on the date of the acquisition of fair value and of historical carrying value 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being recognized evenly over the life of the asset 
at december  and  the gross book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively  and we recorded depreciation expense of million and million during and  respectively 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life takes a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
mmp s terminals  pipelines and related equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years  with a weighted average asset life of approximately years 
if the estimates of these asset lives changed such that the average estimated asset life was reduced from years to years  our depreciation expense for would have increased by million 
because our income taxes consist only of income apportioned to the state of texas  changes to our income tax expense would be minimal  therefore  operating profit and net income would decrease by this same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and assuming mmp s net income allocation for the fourth quarter of  net income would reduce million or 
such a change would impact basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by less than and would not materially impact our liabilities  equity or liquidity
