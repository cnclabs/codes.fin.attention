item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein for information relating to the company s license agreements 
seasonality although retail sales of consumer electronics have typically been higher during the holiday season  stereophones have also seen increased interest as gift items over the years 
management of the company believes that its business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that of sales occurred in the first six months of the fiscal year ended june   and of sales occurred in the latter six months of that fiscal year 
management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers is related to the fact that stereo headphones have become replacement items for portable electronic products 
therefore upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereophones during the holiday season 
working capital and backlog the company s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers 
from time to time  although rarely  the company may extend payment terms to its dealers for a special promotion 
for instance  the company has in the past offered a day payment period for certain customers  such as computer retailers and office supply stores 
based on historical trends  management does not expect these practices to have any material effect on net sales or net income 
the company s backlog of orders as of june  is not deemed material in relation to net sales during fiscal customers the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music  dvd s in vehicles  sound bytes on computer systems  and other audio related media 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company markets its products to approximately  retailers and distributors worldwide 
during  the company s sales to its largest single customer  wal mart stores  inc  were approximately of total gross sales 
the company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the company s line of products 
loss of retailers and distributors means loss of product placement 
the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  electronics stores  and computer retailers 
management believes that any loss of revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease  on a percentage basis  in expenses  thereby partially reducing the impact on the company s operating income 
the five largest customers of 
table of contents the company including wal mart accounted for approximately  and of total sales in  and  respectively 
competition the company focuses on the headphone industry 
the acquisition of addax sound company in  renamed bi audio  expands the company s investment into additional categories of headsets  headphones  and stereophones 
in the stereophone market  the company competes directly with approximately five major competitors  several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the company 
the company s single product focus is unique in the marketplace 
the extent to which retailers view the company as an innovative vendor of high quality headphone products  and a provider of excellent after sales customer service  is the extent to which the company maintains a competitive advantage 
the company relies upon its unique sound  quality workmanship  brand identification  engineering skills  and customer service to maintain its competitive position 
research and development the amount spent on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was  during fiscal year as compared with  during fiscal year and  during fiscal year these activities were conducted by both company personnel and outside consultants 
environmental matters the company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal  state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject 
during fiscal years  and  the amounts incurred in complying with federal  state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the company s earnings or financial condition 
employees as of june   the company employed people 
the company also utilizes temporary personnel to meet seasonal production demands 
foreign sales international markets are serviced through manufacturer s representatives or independent distributors with products produced in the united states and overseas 
our products are sold in countries in the following regions western and eastern europe  scandinavia  the middle east  africa  asia  south america  latin america  the caribbean  and mexico 
the company sells products in the canadian market directly to retailers  and also through a distributor who services smaller specialty accounts 
in the opinion of management  the company s competitive position and risks relating to the conduct of its business in such markets are comparable to the domestic market 
in addition  the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers on imports 
the creation of additional such barriers would reduce the company s revenue and profit 
in addition  any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the company s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lower priced  less profitable products  and could affect overall demand for the company s products

the company maintains a small sales office in switzerland to service the international export marketplace 
the company is aware of no material risks in maintaining this operation 
loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility 
the company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the united states  including europe  the middle east  africa  asia  south america  latin america  the caribbean  and mexico 
the company sells products in the canadian market directly to retailers  and also through a distributor who services smaller specialty accounts 
during the last three fiscal years  net sales of all koss products  were distributed as follows from us from foreign countries total sales in addition to manufacturing facilities in the united states  the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the peoples republic of china  taiwan  and south korea 
these independent supplier entities are distant from the company  which means that we are at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters  war  disease  and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically 
the company maintains finished goods inventory in its us facility to mitigate this risk 
finished goods inventory is stocked at an average of approximately days demand per item 
recovery of a single facility through a replacement of supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take days 
the company believes that it could restore production of its top eighteen selling models which represent of the company s sales revenue within one year 
the company is also at risk if the trade restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin 
in addition  most increases in tariffs and freight charges would not be acceptable to pass along to the company s customers and would directly impact the company s profits 
finally  an additional area of concern for the company is with the continuing war on terror and the most recent developments in north korea  iran  and lebanon 
three of our largest distributors outside the us have already experienced a general tightening of the availability of credit in recent months  which we believe to be partly a result of certain of these external concerns

risk factors 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations or prospects  financial or otherwise 

table of contents reduction in present levels of cash flow could adversely affect the company s business the company s primary source of liquidity over the past months has been operating cash flows 
the company s future cash flows from operations on both a short term and long term basis are dependent upon  but not limited to the company s ability to attract new customers that will sell the company s products and pay for them  the company s ability to retain the company s existing customers at the level of sales previously produced  the volume of sales for these customers  the loss of business of one or more primary customers  changes in types of products that the customers purchase in their sales mix  the volume of royalty income paid to the company by its licensees based upon the terms of each royalty agreement  including the inability to negotiate favorable royalty arrangements and renew current arrangements with certain existing favorable terms  poor or deteriorating economic conditions which would directly impact the ability of the company s customers to remain in business and pay for their products on a timely basis  management s ability to hold the line on any requests for increases in material or labor cost increases  and the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner  amounts due to the company 
in addition  as noted above  the company s cash flow is also dependent  to some extent  upon the ability to maintain operating margins 
if there were a general downturn in economic conditions or other events that caused the company s customers to turn to lower priced  lower margin products  the company s cash flow and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to attract and retain customers to sell the company s products could adversely affect sales volume and future profitability the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company is dependent upon the company s ability to retain an existing base of customers to sell the company s line of products 
loss of customers means loss of product placement 
the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  electronics stores and computer retailers 
since distribution is broadly based  any loss of a customer directly translates into a reduction in sales volume which can only be replaced by replacing a similar number of representative retail outlets 
the inability of the company s sales and marketing staff to obtain new distribution outlets translates into a lack of future growth and possibly a setback in sales volumes when loss of current customers occur 
for example  the loss of a customer representing of the company s business would translate into a reduction in revenues of up to based upon the point through the fiscal year that the customer was lost 
attracting a new customer during the course of a fiscal year could have a positive impact or simply replace an account which has been lost 
in addition  a customer can decide to make a change in the models that it decides to offer for sale 
such changes can take place arbitrarily throughout the course of a year which can cause reductions in sales revenues in proportion to the number of retail outlets that the store represents in the market 
the company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a customer is replaced by a new customer 
a reduction in sales volume would cause a reduction in 
table of contents profitability 
the company s failure to retain existing customers  obtain new customers or develop new product lines that customers would choose to offer to consumers could significantly affect the company s future profitability 
the loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
shift in customer specifications to lower priced items can reduce profit margins negatively impacting profitability the company sells a line of products with a suggested retail price ranging from less than to  the gross margin for each of these models is unique in terms of percentages 
the price range of the products also produces a different level of actual dollar contribution per unit 
for example a product with a gross margin contribution of might yield a contribution for one item  while another item may feature a gross margin which could yield 
the company finds the low priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages  which tends to lower profit contributions 
retail preference for lower priced items can reduce profit margins and contributions 
the risk is that a shift in retail customer specifications toward lower priced items can lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale 
due to the range of products that the company sells  the product sales mix can produce a variation in terms of a range of profit margins 
some customers sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others 
most notably  the budget priced headphone segment of the market below retail which is distributed through computer stores  office supply stores  and mass market retailers tend to yield the lowest gross margins 
an increase in business with these types of accounts  if coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins would reduce profit margins and profitability 
poor economic conditions can restrict or limit product placement  sales and replenishment which could decrease profits deteriorating or weak economic conditions  or a forecast for the same  can trigger changes in inventory stocking at retail 
this may in turn lead to a reduction in model offerings and to out of stock situations 
if a retail customer of the company does not have adequate stocks of the company s products to offer for sale in a retail store  consumers may choose another competitive model instead 
customers operating retail stores anticipate future sales demands and inventory products accordingly 
whenever a general economic slowdown occurs  at both the domestic or foreign level  sales volume levels and re orders change 
these changes directly impact the company s sales and profitability 
the company is not in a position to determine how it will be affected by these circumstances  how extensive the effects may be  or for how long the company may be impacted by these circumstances 
the company s customers respond to changes in economic conditions and any adverse changes in economic conditions can therefore restrict product placement  availability  sales  replenishment and ultimately profitability 
these conditions exist domestically and internationally 
management is subject to decisions made outside its control which could directly affect future profitability retail customers determine which products they will stock for resale 
the company competes with other manufacturers to secure shelf space in retail stores for the company s products 
during the course of a year  changes in the customers management personnel can ultimately lead to changes in the stock assortment offered to consumers 
these changes are often arbitrary 
in addition to changes in personnel within the company s customers  it is also possible that a strategic decision can be made by a retail customer to consolidate vendors  or to discontinue certain product categories altogether 
in these instances  the company s management team may not able to convince customers to reverse such 
table of contents decisions 
the company s management team is also engaged in the effective procurement  assembly  and manufacture of products 
the ability to negotiate with suppliers  maintain productivity  and hold the line on cost increases can be subjected to pressures outside the control of management 
for example  increases in fuel costs can increase rates of freight 
increases of this nature can seldom be avoided and the company may not be able to pass such increases along to its customers 
management s effective control of the manufacturing processes will have a direct impact on the company s future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee levels  and inventory levels 
the company s ability to make effective decisions in managing these areas has a direct effect on future profitability 
accounts receivable amounts due from our customers can be lost as a result of customer bankruptcy  operational difficulty  or failure to pay  negatively impacting future profitability the company has significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from the company s customers 
the accounts receivable balance at the end of the last four quarters averaged approximately million 
terms of payment for customers generally range from cash in advance to net day credit terms 
these credit arrangements are negotiated at unspecified and irregular intervals 
the largest customers generate the largest receivable balances 
if a customer develops operational difficulty it is not uncommon to temporarily suspend payment to vendors 
the company is subject to this risk in the retail marketplace 
from time to time a customer may develop severe operating losses which can lead to a bankruptcy 
in these cases  the company may lose most of the outstanding balance due 
occasionally  the company has been current with a customer at the time such an event occurs 
the more material risk is that of losing the revenue of the customer which might be more onerous than losing the current outstanding accounts receivable 
in addition  many companies that will insure accounts receivables will not do so for the company s largest mass market customers 
an example of such a loss was kmart corporation 
the company recorded a loss of approximately  of which  was repaid in   in and  in  when kmart filed for re organization 
kmart was current with the company at the time that kmart filed chapter bankruptcy in january of the company continued to supply kmart during its post petition re organization and continues to supply the customer profitably today 
the risk is that the company derives most of the company s sales revenue and profits from selling products to retailers for resale to consumers 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could negatively affect future profitability 
company profits can suffer from interruptions in supply chain the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in mainland china  taiwan  and south korea 
these independent supplier entities are distant from the company which means that the company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster  war  disease  and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically 
an additional area of concern for the company is with the continuing war on terror and the most recent developments in north korea  iran  and lebanon 
three of our largest distributors outside the us have already experienced a general tightening of the availability of credit in recent months  which we believe to be partly a result of certain of these external concerns 
therefore  if there are any interruptions in the supply chain for any of these reasons  this could directly impact the company s profits in a negative way 
the company is also at risk if trade restrictions are imposed on the company s products based upon country of origin 
in addition  any increase in tariffs and freight charges may not be acceptable to pass along to the company s customers and could directly impact the company s profits 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect pricing of products and cause customers to purchase lower priced  less 
table of contents profitable products and could affect overall demand for the company s products the company receives a material portion of its revenue and profits from business in canada and europe 
to the extent that value of the us dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions  it increases the cost of the company s products in those jurisdictions  which could create negative pressure on the overall demand for the company s products 
the company gets paid from its international customers in us dollars 
to the extent that increased prices arising from currency fluctuations decrease the overall demand for the company s products and the company s sales or motivate customers to purchase lower priced  lower profit products  the company s revenues  profits  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
company profits can suffer from increasing manufacturing costs in china as a result of increased wages and wage taxes the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in mainland china 
an increase in the cost of labor or taxes on wages in china may lead to an increase in the cost of goods manufactured in china 
the cost of labor and wage taxes have increased in china which means that the company is at risk of higher manufacturing coasts associated with goods manufactured in china 
additionally  in response to inflationary concerns  wages in certain provinces in china have recently increased and may continue to do so in the future 
significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract manufacturing facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured in china which could have a material adverse effect on the company s profit margins and profitability 
the company uses third party carriers to ship our products which may pass on increases in transportaion related fuel cost to the compan y which can reduce profit margins negtively impacting profitability the company uses numerous third party carriers to ship product  both domestically and internationally 
if the price of fuel continues to increase and the carriers choose to pass on these increase to the company  our freight costs may increase 
as a result  the company s freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices 
fuel prices affect freight costs to both our customer s location and our distribution center 
increase in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors have increased and may continue to increase freight costs in the future 
this inflationary pressure of higher fuel costs and continued increase in transportation related fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s profit margins and profitability 
consistency of the company s business with several us retailers the company is particularly concerned about the consistency of business with several us retailers for the coming year 
the recent increases in interest rates may again cause us retailers to sharply curtail inventory increases in advance of this year s holiday season 
the company has already seen some consolidation in product lines  and item elimination  or reductions at several big box retailers this past spring 
the company also recognizes the struggle that many of the company s automobile customers have been reporting in the news  and the potential impact that a reduction in automobile unit sales might have upon our rear seat entertainment products for the automotive market in the coming fiscal year

the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved
