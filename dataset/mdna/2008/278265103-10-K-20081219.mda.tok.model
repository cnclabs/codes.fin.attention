item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item includes statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding our expectations  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this form k regarding our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations reflected in such forward looking statements will prove to have been correct or that we will take any actions that may presently be planned 
certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in item a  risk factors 
all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
general our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and counseling services to high net worth individuals and institutions 
our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels 
in executing this strategy  we have developed a broadly diversified product line and a powerful marketing  distribution and customer service capability 
although we manage and distribute a wide range of products and services  we operate in one business segment  namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts 
we are a market leader in a number of investment areas  including tax managed equity  value equity  equity income  emerging market equity  floating rate bank loan  municipal bond  investment grade and high yield bond investing 
our diversified product line offers fund shareholders  retail managed account investors  institutional investors and high net worth clients a wide range of products and services designed and managed to generate attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term 
our equity products encompass a diversity of investment objectives  risk profiles  income levels and geographic representation 
our income investment products cover a broad duration and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax free investments 
as of october   we had billion in assets under management 
our principal retail marketing strategy is to distribute funds and separately managed accounts through financial intermediaries in the advice channel 
we have a broad reach in this marketplace  with distribution partners including national and regional broker dealers  independent broker dealers  independent financial advisory firms  banks and insurance companies 
we support these distribution partners with a team of more than sales professionals covering us and international markets 
specialized sales and marketing professionals in our wealth management solutions group serve as a resource to financial advisors seeking to help high net worth clients address wealth management issues and support the marketing of our products and services tailored to this marketplace 
we also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high net worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis 
through our wholly owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high net worth marketplace  including corporations  endowments  foundations  family offices and public and private employee retirement plans 
specialized sales teams at our affiliates develop relationships in this market and deal directly with these clients 
our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory  administration  distribution and service fees received from eaton vance funds and investment advisory fees received from separate accounts 
our fees are based primarily on the value of the investment portfolios we manage and fluctuate with changes in the total value and mix of assets under management 
such fees are recognized over the period that we manage these assets 
our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred sales commissions  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  investments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
market developments the twelve months coinciding with our fiscal was a period of dramatic upheaval for global markets  as virtually every class of financial assets experienced significant price declines and high volatility  particularly following the failure of lehman brothers holdings in mid september 
over the twelve month period  the dow jones industrial average declined percent and the s p index declined percent 
in fixed income markets  a flight to quality lowered yields on us treasuries and pushed up credit spreads in virtually all sectors  with major dislocation in mortgage backed securities  corporate credit and municipal finance 
numerous federal interventions were required to ensure the stability of the banking system and the continued availability of commercial and consumer credit 
global markets continue to experience unprecedented volatility as we move into fiscal  amid signs that the current recession may be deep and prolonged 
we anticipate a challenging business climate ahead 
because our assets under management at fiscal year end were substantially below our average managed asset levels for fiscal  we will likely experience a significant decline in revenue in fiscal relative to fiscal unless market conditions improve 
although we have taken steps to manage our costs in response to current market conditions  we expect our profit margins and net income also to be adversely affected 
in this period of turmoil  we maintain our financial flexibility and remain committed to the further development of our business franchise

these increases were partially offset by decreases in distribution and underwriter fees due to a decrease in average assets under management subject to these fees and a decrease in other revenue due to net realized and unrealized losses recognized on investments in consolidated funds 
net realized and unrealized losses on investments held in the portfolios of consolidated funds totaled million in fiscal  compared to net realized and unrealized gains of million in fiscal a decrease in expenses of million  or percent  due to decreases in distribution expense and the amortization of deferred sales commissions 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in service fee expense  fund expenses and other expenses 
the million decrease in distribution expense can be primarily attributed to the payment of one time structuring fees related to closed end funds offered in fiscal and payments made to terminate dealer compensation agreements related to certain previously offered closed end funds  which together totaled million

a decrease in interest expense of million due to the redemption of our zero coupon exchangeable senior notes in august offset by interest accrued on our million senior note offering in the fourth quarter of an increase in realized and unrealized losses of million due to a million loss on the termination of an interest rate lock in october  offset by gains recognized on the disposition of certain investments in sponsored funds and on the liquidation of an investment in a cdo entity 
a decrease in income taxes of million  reflecting the decrease in taxable income 
a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million shares  or percent  reflecting share repurchases in fiscal in evaluating operating performance we consider operating income and net income  which are calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  as well as adjusted operating income  an internally derived non gaap performance measure 
we define adjusted operating income as operating income excluding the results of consolidated funds  and adding back closed end fund structuring fees and one time payments  stock based compensation and any write off of intangible assets or goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
we believe that adjusted operating income is a key indicator of our ongoing profitability and therefore use this measure as the basis for calculating performance based management incentives 
adjusted operating income is not  and should not be construed to be  a substitute for operating income computed in accordance with gaap 
however  in assessing the performance of the business  our management and the board of directors look at adjusted operating income as a measure of underlying performance  since operating results of consolidated funds and amounts resulting from one time events eg  the offering of a closed end fund do not necessarily represent normal results of operations 
in addition  when assessing performance  management and the board look at performance both with and without stock based compensation

in fiscal  we incurred net realized losses on investments totaling million  consisting of a million loss on the termination of an interest rate lock offset by net investment gains of million realized on the disposition of certain investments in sponsored funds and million realized on the liquidation of an investment in a cdo entity 
the interest rate lock was entered into as a hedge against adverse movements in treasury rates in anticipation of the issuance of senior notes with a maturity in excess of ten years 
when we determined that we would not issue senior notes with a maturity in excess of ten years  the interest rate lock was terminated and the net settlement amount was recorded as a loss on investments

unrealized losses on investments of million in fiscal relate to investments in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
we recognized impairment losses totaling million in fiscal  representing losses relating to investments in four cash instrument cdo entities and one synthetic cdo entity 
the impairment losses associated with the four cash instrument cdo entities resulted from a decrease in the estimated future cash flows from the cdo entities combined with an increase in the market yield we use to discount the value of those cash flows to reflect current market conditions 
the decrease in estimated future cash flows associated with these entities resulted from increases in projected default rates and decreases in projected recovery rates 
the impairment loss associated with the synthetic cdo entity also resulted from a decrease in the estimated future cash flows from the entity combined with an increase in the market yield we use to discount the value of those cash flows to reflect current market conditions 
the decrease in estimated future cash flows associated with the synthetic cdo entity resulted from higher anticipated default rates and lower anticipated recovery rates on the reference securities underlying the synthetic cdo entity s portfolio of credit default swaps 
we recognized impairment losses totaling million in fiscal relating to our investment in two cash instrument cdo entities resulting from the effect of tightening credit spreads and higher than forecasted prepayment rates on the entities investments

we periodically review these tax positions and provide for and adjust as necessary estimated liabilities relating to such positions as part of our overall tax provision 
minority interest minority interest increased by million in fiscal over the same period a year earlier  primarily due to a million adjustment in fiscal to reverse stock based compensation previously allocated to minority shareholders of our majority owned subsidiaries offset by a decrease in the interests held by minority shareholders of atlanta capital and parametric portfolio associates 
in the second quarter of fiscal we determined that the allocation of stock based compensation expense to minority shareholders reduces our liability to minority shareholders in a manner that is not consistent with the agreements governing partnership distributions to those individuals 
the million adjustment represents the reversal of accumulated stock based compensation expense allocated to minority shareholders from the date of acquisition 
stock based compensation expense allocated to minority shareholders in prior periods was neither quantitatively nor qualitatively material to our consolidated financial statements in any of our previously reported fiscal years or periods 
minority interest increased by percent in fiscal  primarily due to the increased profitability of majority owned subsidiaries atlanta capital and parametric portfolio associates 
minority interest is not adjusted for taxes due to the underlying tax status of our consolidated subsidiaries 
atlanta capital  fox asset management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors are limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
funds we consolidate are registered investment companies or private funds that are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  at october  reflects our percent minority equity interest in eaton vance cash management fund  an open end money market mutual fund that invests in short term obligations and other money market instruments  our percent minority equity interest in lloyd george management and a percent minority equity interest in a private equity partnership 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  increased by million  or percent  in fiscal primarily due an increase in net income of both lloyd george management and the private equity partnership 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal primarily due to our sale of certain investments in sponsored mutual funds that were accounted for under the equity method in prior periods  offset by increases in equity in net income of both lloyd george management and the private equity partnership 
changes in financial condition and liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources on october   and and for the years then ended balance sheet and cash flow data october  in thousands balance sheet data assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments investment advisory fees and other receivables long term investments deferred income taxes long term liabilities taxes payable current deferred income taxes current deferred income taxes long term long term debt for the years ended october  in thousands cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows liquidity and capital resources liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and investment advisory fees and other receivables 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
short term investments consist of investments in sponsored cash management and short term income funds 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent  percent and percent of total assets on october   and  respectively 
on october   our current debt included million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year notes due we also maintain a million revolving credit facility with several banks  which expires on august  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
on october   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
notwithstanding current conditions in the global equity and credit markets  we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs and to satisfy our future commitments 
the risk exists  however  that if we determine we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
income taxes long term deferred income taxes  which in previous periods related principally to the deferred income tax liability associated with deferred sales commissions offset by the deferred income tax benefit associated with stock based compensation  changed from a net long term deferred tax liability to a net long term deferred tax benefit in fiscal as a result of a change in tax accounting method for certain closed end fund expenses 
we filed the change in tax accounting method with the internal revenue service in the first quarter of fiscal for expenses associated with the launch of closed end funds  which were historically deducted for tax purposes as incurred and are now capitalized and amortized over a year period 
upon filing the change in tax accounting method  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of million  the majority of which will amortize over a year period  and a corresponding deferred tax liability in the amount of million  which will reverse over a four year period ending october  the net current deferred tax liability of million as of october  principally represents the current portion of the remaining million deferred tax liability associated with the change in accounting method 
current taxes payable decreased by million in fiscal  reflecting a current tax provision totaling million offset by million of income taxes paid 
current taxes payable were further impacted by the recognition of a million liability related to uncertain tax positions in connection with the adoption of interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin in fiscal  offset by the recognition of million of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the current fiscal year 
contractual obligations the following table details our future contractual obligations as of october  payments due in millions total less than year years years after years operating leases facilities and equipment senior notes interest payment on senior notes investment in private equity partnership unrealized tax benefits total in july  we committed to invest million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
as of october   we had invested million of the total million of committed capital 
in september  we signed a long term lease to move our corporate headquarters to a new location in boston 
the lease will commence in may capital expenditures  including those for the build out of our new corporate headquarters  are anticipated to be approximately million in fiscal gross of tenant reallowances of million  and are expected to be funded from available cash balances 
excluded from the table above are future payments to be made by us to purchase the interests retained by minority investors in atlanta capital  fox asset management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors 
interests held by minority unit holders are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of minority interests is predicated  for each subsidiary  on the exercise of a complex series of puts held by minority unit holders and calls held by us 
the puts provide the minority shareholders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specific intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the minority shareholders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specific intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any minority interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of a minority interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any minority interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any minority interest purchase in the future 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of minority interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
in the second quarter of  the minority investors in parametric portfolio associates exercised a put option  requiring us to purchase an additional interest in parametric portfolio associates for million 
the transaction settled on may  and increased our capital ownership interest from percent to percent and our profits interest from percent to percent 
the additional purchase price was allocated between intangible assets  goodwill and minority interest 
in the third quarter of  the minority investors in atlanta capital exercised a put option  requiring us to purchase an additional interest in atlanta capital for million 
the transaction settled on june  and increased our ownership interest from percent to percent 
the additional purchase price was allocated between intangible assets  goodwill and minority interest 
in october  the company  as lender  entered into a million subordinated term note agreement the note with a sponsored private equity fund 
the note earns daily interest based on the the senior creditor s cost of commercial paper funding plus a margin 
we currently anticipate that the note  which expires on january   will likely be renewed upon expiration for an additional day period 
subject to certain conditions  the private equity fund may prepay the note in whole or in part  at any time  without premium or penalty 
the note is included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of other assets 
in november  the company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the tax advantaged bond strategies tabs business of md sass investors services md sass  a privately held investment manager based in new york  new york 
the tabs business being acquired managed approximately billion in client assets as of october   consisting of approximately billion in institutional and high net worth family office accounts and approximately billion in retail managed accounts 
following the closing  the tabs business will be organized as the tax advantaged bond strategies division of eaton vance management  and will maintain its current leadership  portfolio team and investment strategies 
its tax advantaged income products and services will continue to be offered directly to institutional and family office clients  and by evd to retail investors through financial intermediaries 
at closing  the company will pay million in cash to acquire the tabs business 
the company will be obligated to make seven annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december       and all future payments will be paid in cash 
the company anticipates that the transaction will close on or before december  an eaton vance sponsored closed end fund has proposed to offer  on a private basis  million of liquidity protected preferred shares lpp shares  which are a new type of variable rate preferred equity security that are backed by the unconditional purchase obligation of a designated liquidity provider 
in conjunction with the initial offering of lpp shares  the company expects to enter into an agreement with the liquidity provider that grants the liquidity provider the right to put the lpp shares that it holds to the company under certain specified circumstances 
in support of the put agreement  the company expects to enter into an escrow agreement pursuant to which the company would deposit million  invested in short term us government securities  to provide an assured source of funds to meet the company s potential purchase obligations 
the escrow agreement would lapse upon termination of the put agreement or the earlier agreement of the company and the liquidity provider 
the liquidity provider s put right generally will terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the lpp share liquidity agreement and the expiration of the day term of the liquidity agreement 
although the offering has been delayed by current market events  the company believes the offering may be completed in fiscal the company believes that if it were required to purchase lpp shares from the liquidity provider it would likely only be required to hold such shares for a short period and would earn returns that exceed its cost of short term funding 
the company does not believe that there should be an ongoing requirement to offer a put right to liquidity providers once an active market develops for lpp shares  and does not expect a put agreement to be an ongoing feature of future lpp share arrangements 
operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect changes in assets and liabilities  deferred sales commissions  stock based compensation  deferred income taxes and investments classified as trading 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million in the fiscal years ended october   and  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal can be primarily attributed to an increase in the purchase of trading securities by consolidated funds and in separate accounts seeded for new development purposes 
the purchase of trading securities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
operating cash flows in include the payment of million to settle an interest rate lock transaction associated with our ten year senior note offering 
we entered into the interest rate lock to hedge against movement in ten year treasury prices between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the interest rate lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the interest rate lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the amount recorded in other comprehensive income will be amortized over the life of the senior notes and recorded as a component of interest expense 
investing cash flows investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  the purchase of equity interests from minority investors in our majority owned subsidiaries and the purchase and sale of investments in our sponsored mutual funds that we do not consolidate 
cash used for investing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  additions to equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million  compared to million in both fiscal and fiscal additions in fiscal reflect tenant improvements made to our new corporate headquarters in fiscal in anticipation of our move in fiscal the purchase of minority members interests of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  represents the purchase of additional ownership interests in atlanta capital and parametric portfolio associates as more fully described in contractual obligations above 
in fiscal  and  net purchases and sales of available for sale investments reduced investing cash flows by million  million and million  respectively 
financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect the issuance and repayment of long term debt  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies and cash paid to meet redemptions by minority shareholders of these funds 
cash provided by used for financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of our non voting common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends per share were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we increased our quarterly dividend by percent to per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the senior note offering  we paid approximately million in debt offering costs that will be amortized over the life of the notes and recognized as a component of interest expense 
in august  evm retired in full its then outstanding zero coupon exchangeable notes with an accreted value on redemption date of million 
we believe that the remaining proceeds from our million senior note offering in fiscal  cash provided by current operating activities and borrowings available to us under our million credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our short term and long term operating needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which redemptions by the purchasing shareholder are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years from purchase 
distribution plan payments received from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received from redeeming shareholders of these funds are generally applied to reduce the company s unamortized deferred sales commission assets 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we periodically review the recoverability of deferred sales commission assets as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of deferred sales commission assets may not be recoverable and adjust the deferred sales commission assets accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital  fox asset management and parametric portfolio associates to a single reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing using discounted cash flow analyses and appropriate market multiples 
in this process  we make assumptions related to projected future earnings and cash flow  market multiples and applicable discount rates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
fin requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
the difference between the tax benefit recognized in the income tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit 
these unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
the company classifies any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
investments in cdo entities we act as collateral or investment manager for a number of cash instrument cdo entities and one synthetic cdo entity pursuant to management agreements between us and the entities 
at october   combined assets under management in these entities upon which we earn a management fee were approximately billion 
we had combined investments in five of these entities valued at million on october we account for our investments in these entities under emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the excess of future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method 
we review cash flow estimates throughout the life of each investment pool to determine whether an impairment of its investments should be recognized 
cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of collateral securities or  in the case of the synthetic cdo  the reference securities underlying its credit default swap positions and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers  the forecasted default and recovery rates and our past experience in managing similar securities 
if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 
fair value is determined using current information  notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the interest 
market yields  default rates and recovery rates used in our estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools and current market conditions 
in periods when market conditions necessitate an increase in the market yield used by a market participant and or in periods of rising default rates and lower recovery rates  the fair value  and therefore carrying value  of our investments in these entities may be adversely affected 
our risk of loss in these entities is limited to the million carrying value of the investments on our consolidated balance sheet at october  stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected

the remainder of this page is intentionally left blank item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from our investments in sponsored equity funds  our equity interest in affiliates  investments in equity securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and investments in equity securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october  in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease trading equity securities available for sale securities sponsored funds investment in affiliates total our primary direct exposure to interest rate risk arises from our investment in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored by us  debt securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and debt securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
we considered the negative effect on pre tax interest income of a basis point percent decline in interest rates as of october  a basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical scenario used to demonstrate potential risk and does not represent our management s view of future market changes 
the following is a summary of the effect that a basis point percent percent decline in interest rates would have on our pre tax net income as of october  in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates trading debt securities available for sale securities sponsored funds total from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interests in the cash instrument and synthetic cdo entities that are included in long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
as an investor in a cdo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the cdo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery rates of the underlying instruments held by the cdo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities or  in the case of the synthetic cdo  the reference securities underlying its credit default swap positions are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in the number of defaults  cdo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in cdo entities was valued at million as of october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside of the united states 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
