zargis medical corp 
in january  we co invested with siemens corporate research  inc  a subsidiary of siemens corporation  in zargis medical corp 
to develop non invasive  diagnostic support solutions that automatically analyze acoustical data from a patient to determine physiologically significant features useful in medical diagnosis 
the development of zargis patented technology is a pioneering effort in medicine which uses advanced signal processing algorithms deployed on standard computer platforms 
the first zargis device  cardioscan  received its initial fda authorization in may and additional authorizations in september and march cardioscan is currently being tested by a small group of physicians during general medical examinations and physicals to help detect and analyze suspected heart murmurs which could be a sign of valvular and congenital heart disease 
zargis is currently researching  and conducting trials on  additional noninvasive diagnostic support tools that process acoustical data from the body in order to provide an accurate and intelligible assessment of a patient s health 
these assessments may be used by physicians and other healthcare providers to assist in the early identification or monitoring of heart  lung  vascular and other conditions and to provide better patient treatment 
major next steps remaining for zargis include continuing market trials and clinical trials for new applications of the zargis technology and the formation of strategic partnerships designed to support product commercialization 
in february  we acquired a controlling interest in zargis medical 
at december   as a result of continued investment  our ownership interest was approximately 
in october  zargis and the m company entered into an exclusive multi year marketing alliance involving zargis heart sound analysis software and m littmann s next generation electronic stethoscope 
under the agreement  zargis will support m in its efforts to develop a next generation stethoscope that will be compatible with zargis heart sound analysis software 
in addition  the alliance provides zargis with a wide range of marketing and promotional opportunities along with exclusive rights to sell its heart sound analysis software through the global distribution network of the littmann brand 
the agreement grants m a minority equity position in zargis  following the first sale of zargis software through the m distribution channel and in the event the agreement is renewed after an initial two year term and certain other conditions are met  and a seat on zargis board of directors 
f b g dtfood 
we own of f b g dtfood  the creator and operator of the original eurocentric chic and quick caf  which is operating one store in manhattan 
the acquisition price was  in may in february  we reduced our cash investment in f b g dtfood and received  while maintaining our original interest 
in december  as a result of renegotiation  our interest increased to without an additional investment 
as a result of certain milestones not having been met  in our interest increased to 
we have also entered into a management services contract with f b g dtfood that will result in direct revenues to us although these revenues will be eliminated on our consolidated financial statements 
broadband patents 
we have accumulated a portfolio of patents that teach and cover the improvement of high speed wireless communication systems to allow greater information content  reliability  clarity  more efficient use of licensed spectrum as compared to prior systems and other advances 
we have domestic patents with expiration dates ranging from through  with approximately international counterparts in countries 
we also have domestic patents pending and patents pending in an additional countries 
certain wireless communications systems may employ a number of different combinations of our patented technology to maximize operational and spectrum efficiency 
while we believe that there is great value in our patented technologies  it is a lengthy and expensive process to investigate and pursue licensing patent infringement cases 
we are evaluating a strategy for the utilization of these patents in the future  which may include pursuit of licensing or development of other strategic opportunities with users of the underlying technology 
we have licensed technology in the past  both domestically and internationally  but are not currently receiving any license fees 
on may   we filed two separate complaints against cellco partnership d b a verizon wireless in united states district court in the southern district of florida  in which we assert that verizon wireless is infringing two patents 
verizon wireless is a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc 
in may  we reached a mutual agreement with verizon wireless leading to the dismissal of the two separate complaints that we filed against verizon wireless 
no financial consideration was paid or received by either party 
on june   we filed two separate complaints against alltel corp 
in united states district court in the southern district of florida  in which we assert that alltel is infringing two patents 
in an amended complaint  we asserted claims for infringement against alltel communications  inc and alltel wireless holdings  inc  in addition to alltel corp 
in april  the case was transferred to united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas 
in november  one of the complaints was dismissed with prejudice 
a claim interpretation hearing was held on february   however  no order has been entered interpreting the claim at issue 
the court has set the matter for trial during the two week period commencing on july  a separate lawsuit was commenced in october against all wireless  llc  a florida company  in united states district court in the middle district of florida  alleging infringement 
the all wireless litigation has been stayed pending the completion of the claim construction process in the alltel litigation 
wibiki 
during  our technology resources and experience in wireless broadband enabled us to conceive a new software based wibiki initiative to leverage existing wi fi infrastructures to reduce cost and complexity that is now available at www 
gobiki 
com 
the business premise for wibiki is an advertising platform we call adbiki adchooser 
on september   wibiki launched a new beta service to transform web ads into a usable space by wibiki members for sharing web content with their friends 
we continue to evolve the wibiki platform beyond its original wireless focus 
adbiki is versatile  can scale to a large user base and is the underpinning for the netfreeus proposed service described below 
netfreeus 
in march  netfreeus  a new wholly owned subsidiary  asked the fcc for authority to manage a new nationwide wireless public broadband wpb network in the mhz frequency band 
netfreeus wireless public broadband wpb service will never charge monthly fees 
netfreeus will coordinate third party lessees who would own and operate wireless access points waps with no lessee authorized to operate more than waps 
wpb will promote localism and the provision of advertising and public service messages targeted to local interests and communities  as well as local business and economic development  through ubiquitous coverage provided by small footprint networks 
on august   the fcc issued an order that dismissed without prejudice the application filed by netfreeus and other applicants to provide wireless service 
netfreeus has filed a petition for partial reconsideration with the fcc requesting a grant of its application and petition for forbearance and has also filed a notice to intervene in an action filed by another applicant in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the latter filing was granted and we are now a party to this proceeding 
local multipoint distribution service lmds license 
we have an fcc commercial operating license  awarded to us in recognition of our efforts in developing and deploying lmds technology and for spearheading its regulatory approval at the fcc  which covers mhz of spectrum in the new york city area 
under fcc authorization  the license includes an additional mhz of spectrum until the first ka band satellite is launched  an event which is not currently determinable 
the license provides that the spectrum may be used for a wide variety of fixed wireless purposes  including wireless local loop telephony  high speed internet access and two way teleconferencing 
the license has been renewed through february  conditioned upon demonstrating to the fcc by march  that we are providing substantial service 
on march   we filed a notification that we are providing substantial service in accordance with fcc standards 
on march   out of an abundance of caution  we requested a contingent waiver and an extension of time until march  to demonstrate substantial service  to the extent our earlier demonstration is not deemed compliant with fcc standards 
on july   we were informed by the fcc that we had not demonstrated that we were providing substantial service on the required date and were granted a waiver to extend the construction and substantial service deadline under the company s fcc license renewal to october  in january  we filed a waiver request with the fcc for a limited extension of the deadline for substantial service consistent with that filed by the lmds coalition  a consortium of license holders and equipment vendors 
we will not commence a full marketing effort using our lmds technology until new lmds equipment becomes commercially available with cost and performance that allow implementation of an economically viable business model 
we cannot determine when this will occur and this equipment may never be available to us on this basis 
other 
we have invested a portion of our assets in a portfolio of marketable securities consisting of publicly traded equity securities 
we have also invested a portion of our assets in equity and debt instruments of non publicly held companies 
we have in the past and may in the future sell publicly traded equity securities we do not own in anticipation of declines in the fair market values of these securities 
we have generated operating losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception and expect to continue to do so in the near future 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of those financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of operating revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for a description of all of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
however  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents  united states treasury bills and marketable securities and may include securities sold and not purchased 
the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates market value since these highly liquid  interest earning investments are invested in money market funds 
marketable securities consist of publicly traded equity securities classified as trading securities and are recorded at fair market value  ie  closing prices quoted on established securities markets 
securities sold and not repurchased are also carried at the fair market value of the securities 
significant changes in the market value of securities that we invest in could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we have also invested in equity and debt instruments of non publicly held companies and account for them under the cost method since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
we monitor these investments for other than temporary impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions  operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment  and record reductions in carrying values when necessary 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and other intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable through estimated future cash flows from that asset 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
share based payments 
prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended  which defines a fair value method of measuring and accounting for compensation expense from employee stock options 
fasb also allowed accounting for such options under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we elected to use the intrinsic value method and adopted the disclosure only provisions of fasb generally  no compensation cost was recognized since stock options were issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date 
effective january   we adopted fasb r  share based payment  using the modified prospective application method 
under this method  for all unvested awards as of january   we record compensation cost based upon the fair value of those awards on the grant date over the remaining service period of each award on a straight line basis 
for awards granted after january   we record compensation cost based upon the fair value of those awards on the grant date over the service period of each award on a straight line basis 
we estimate the value of these awards on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of these awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected forfeiture rates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fasb r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fasb r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under fasb r 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of these awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we do not believe that reasonable changes in the projections would have had a material effect on share based compensation expense 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations will be affected in the period that the difference is known 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in menu prices at the company s first store and the lack of customer acceptance of the f b format at the second store 
we closed the second store  with revenues of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  in december selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of decreases in stock based compensation in the amount of  as well as decreases as a result of personnel reductions 
research and development expenses decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a  decrease during in connection with new wireless initiatives by the company  net of a  increase as a result of continuing development of zargis medical device technology 
depreciation and amortization decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in amortization of medical technology in the amount of  from the completion of amortization of medical technology resulting from the zargis acquisition and a decrease in amortization of a patent in the amount of  from the completion of amortization 
investment income loss increased  from a net gain in the amount of  for the twelve months ended december  to a net gain in the amount of  for the twelve months ended december  realized gains decreased  from net gains of  for the twelve months ended december  to net gains of  for the twelve months ended december  unrealized gains increased  from net losses of  for the twelve months ended december  to net gains of  for the twelve months ended december  interest income decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in interest income is a result of a lesser amount of funds available for short term investment 
these investment income amounts will fluctuate based upon changes in the market value of the underlying investments  overall market conditions and the amount of funds available for short term investment and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future periods 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in menu prices at the company s first store and the temporary closing of the second store for renovations  as well as a lack of customer acceptance of the f b format at the second store 
we are testing new menu concepts as a solution to customer acceptance 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily a result of increases in legal expenses in connection with litigating patent infringement claims in the amount of  and stock based compensation in the amount of  net of decreases in other legal expenses in the amount of  and taxes in the amount of  as a result of the receipt of a withholding tax refund  as well as decreases as a result of personnel reductions 
research and development expenses decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a lower level of expenses incurred during in connection with new wireless initiatives by the company 
depreciation and amortization decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in amortization of medical technology from the completion of amortization of early tranches of medical technology resulting from the zargis acquisition  net of an increase as a result of renovation to one of the f b restaurant stores 
cost of sales decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in revenues 
investment income loss increased  from a net loss in the amount of  for the twelve months ended december  to a net gain in the amount of  for the twelve months ended december  realized gains increased  from net losses of  for the twelve months ended december  to net gains of  for the twelve months ended december  unrealized losses decreased  from net losses of  for the twelve months ended december  to net losses of  for the twelve months ended december  interest income increased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in interest income  net of a decrease as a result of a lesser amount of funds available for short term investment  is a result of increased interest rates 
these investment income amounts will fluctuate based upon changes in the market value of the underlying investments  overall market conditions and the amount of funds available for short term investment and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future periods 
minority interest represents the interest of minority stockholders in the losses of f b g dtfood and zargis medical since the dates of acquisition of a majority interest 
through the year ended december   f b g dtfood and zargis medical continued to generate losses which  during  reduced the minority interest balance to zero 
as result  the company is consolidating of the losses for these entities and continues to fund their operations with intercompany loans or additional investment  which are eliminated in consolidation 
during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded a benefit from taxes in the amount of  as a result of a tax refund from the filing of amended tax returns 
no such gain was recorded in liquidity and capital resources the company has recorded operating losses and negative operating cash flows in each year of its operations since inception 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  this net increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily the result of a tax refund received in net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  this net increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily the result of an  increase in maturities  net of a  increase in purchases  of united states treasury bills 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  this net decrease in cash used in financing activities is a result of a decrease in repurchases of treasury stock 
at december   the company s future minimum lease payments due under noncancelable leases aggregated      and  is due during the years ending december     and  respectively  and  is payable thereafter 
in addition  in connection with a license agreement to which the company is a party  a termination payment will be payable by the company in the amount of  or  if the license agreement is terminated by the company before september or september  respectively 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to finance its current level of operations and expected capital requirements through the fiscal year 
however  the company does not expect to have earnings from operations until such time as it successfully commercializes business opportunities under development  substantially increases its customer base and or forms a strategic alliance for use of its capabilities in the future 
we cannot predict when this will occur 
we have no material non cancelable commitments and the amount of future capital funding requirements will depend on a number of factors that we cannot quantify  including the success of our business and the types of services we offer  as well as other factors that are not within our control  including competitive conditions  government regulatory developments and capital costs 
the lack of additional capital in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and prospects for growth

we purchase these securities in anticipation of increases in the fair market values of the securities 
we have in the past and may in the future sell publicly traded equity securities we do not own in anticipation of declines in the fair market values of these securities 
when we sell securities that we do not own  we must borrow the securities we sold in order to deliver them and settle the trades 
thereafter  we must buy the securities and deliver them to the lender of the securities 
our potential for loss on these transactions is unlimited since the value of the underlying security can keep increasing
