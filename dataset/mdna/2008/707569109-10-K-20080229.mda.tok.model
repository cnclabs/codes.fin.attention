we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions  including the acquisitions of hollywood casino corporation in march  argosy gaming company argosy in october  black gold casino at zia park in april  and sanford orlando kennel club in october on june   we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement that would ultimately result in our shareholders receiving per share

the vast majority of our revenues is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our off track wagering facilities otws 
we intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions of gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions 
executive summary factors affecting our results for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   included revenue growth at several of our properties  the reopening of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  the acquisition of black gold casino at zia park  and lower insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net revenues at empress casino hotel and hollywood casino baton rouge  costs related to our support of local referenda in kansas and west virginia  and costs associated with our previously announced merger 
highlights for the year net revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to revenue growth at several of our properties  including the argosy casino riverside  charles town entertainment complex  hollywood casino aurora  argosy casino lawrenceburg  and hollywood slots at bangor  the reopening of hollywood casino bay st

in may  the illinois legislature passed into law house bill  effective may   which singled out four of the nine illinois casinos  including our empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora  for a tax surcharge to subsidize local horse racing interests 
on may   empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora joined with the two other riverboats affected by the law  and filed suit in the circuit court of the twelfth judicial district in will county  illinois the court  asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional 
the casinos began paying the tax surcharge during the three months ended june  into a protest fund which accrues interest during the pendency of the lawsuit  and have subsequently expensed approximately million in incremental tax  including million during the year ended december  the accumulated funds will be returned to the casinos if they ultimately prevail in the lawsuit 
in two orders dated march  and april   the court declared the law unconstitutional under the uniformity clause of the illinois constitution and enjoined the collection of this tax surcharge 
the state of illinois requested  and was granted  a stay of this ruling

we are continuing to build and develop several of our properties  including the charles town entertainment complex  argosy casino lawrenceburg and the permanent hollywood slots at bangor  which will be called the hollywood slots hotel and raceway 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 
critical accounting policies we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the policies related to the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting policies  which require us to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within the consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be calculated based upon the discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within the consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions and projections for future operations 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  we consider our gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization 
rather  these intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life  including the management service contract for casino rama  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas  on january  fin created a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin also provided guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  retained earnings balance 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet at december  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions such as in pennsylvania  maine and kansas and property expansion in under penetrated markets such as at our lawrenceburg property 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as through the smoking ban in illinois that was signed in july and became effective on january  the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in kansas and kentucky and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as in kansas  maryland  ohio  and kentucky 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
we also face uncertainty regarding anticipated gaming expansion by one of our competitors in baton rouge  louisiana 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties 
the ongoing successful expansion and revenue gains at the charles town entertainment complex  argosy casino lawrenceburg  hollywood casino at penn national race course and hollywood slots at bangor 
the successful execution of the development and construction activities currently underway at a number of our facilities  as well as the risks associated with the costs  regulatory approval and the timing for these activities
