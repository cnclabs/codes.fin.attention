item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on oncology and inflammatory indications 
we use our proprietary drug discovery technology  known as phage display  to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds for clinical development 
this phage display technology fuels our internal pipeline of promising drug candidates and attracts numerous licensees and collaborators  with the potential to generate important revenues in the future 
our lead product candidate  dx ecallantide  is in late stage clinical trial development in two separate indications 
the more advanced indication involves treatment of hereditary angioedema hae  a potentially life threatening inflammatory condition 
we have completed three phase trials and one phase trial of dx in this indication 
a second phase trial  known as edema  began in april given our familiarity with the hae patient community and its relatively small number of treating allergists  we believe the optimal commercialization strategy for the hae indication is for us to build an internal sales team to promote dx in the united states and to establish regional partnerships for distribution in other major market countries 
the second indication for dx is for the prevention of blood loss during on pump cardiothoracic surgery cts 
in this indication  we have completed a phase trial of dx for the prevention of blood loss during on pump coronary artery bypass graft cabg procedures 
in may  we also initiated a phase trial for further development of dx in on pump cts  including cabg and heart valve replacement or repair procedures 
further development of dx in on pump cts will require large clinical trials and sizable development resources 
consequently  we have determined that the best way to advance dx in this indication would be through a strategic collaboration 
in addition to dx  our phage display technology and expertise has allowed us to develop a substantial pipeline of high quality drug candidates 
our goal is to maintain over ten ongoing therapeutic programs in our pipeline at all times 
of our existing pipeline candidates  the furthest developed are dx and dx  two promising fully human monoclonal antibodies with unique mechanisms of action in attacking cancerous tumors 
in february  we entered into a license agreement with sanofi aventis under which sanofi aventis will be responsible for the continued development of dx all of the compounds in our pipeline were discovered using our proprietary phage display technology  which rapidly identifies product candidates that bind with high affinity and specificity to therapeutic targets 
although we use this technology primarily to advance our own internal development activities  we also leverage it through licenses and collaborations designed to generate revenues and gain us access to co develop and or co promote drug candidates identified by other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
through this program  which we refer to as our licensing and funded research program  or lfrp  we have agreements with more than licensees and collaborators  resulting in product candidates that licensed third parties have advanced into clinical trials 
we have assigned a portion of the current and future revenues generated through the lfrp to paul royalty holdings ii  lp in connection with a financing in we incurred losses in and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years 
we do not expect to generate profits until the therapeutic products from our development portfolio reach the market after being subjected to the uncertainties of the regulatory approval process 
clinical development programs dx for hae we are developing dx as a treatment for hae 
through february   all development activities were conducted in collaboration with genzyme corporation and managed through dyax genzyme llc  a jointly owned limited liability company 
on february   we reached a mutual agreement with genzyme to terminate our collaboration 
see footnote investment in joint venture dyax genzyme llc and other related party transactions for additional information regarding this agreement and the joint venture for the periods before the termination 
as a result  we are now solely responsible for the future development of dx for hae 
the clinical development of dx for hae is summarized as follows in march  we completed a patient  multi center  open label  single dose  dose escalating phase study  known as edema in may  we completed a patient  multi center  placebo controlled  single dose  dose escalating phase study  known as edema in january  we completed a attack patient  multi center  open label  repeat dosing phase study  known as edema in november  we completed a patient  multi center  phase study  known as the edema trial  which was conducted at sites in the united states  europe  canada and israel 
the primary objective of the edema trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of our fixed mg subcutaneous sc dose of dx for patients suffering from moderate to severe acute hae attacks 
the edema trial was comprised of two phases a double blind  placebo controlled phase and a repeat dosing phase 
in the first phase  hae patients received either a single dose of dx or placebo 
after patients received one treatment in the placebo controlled portion of the study  they were eligible for the second phase where they received repeat dosing with dx for any subsequent acute attacks 
in the edema trial  statistically significant results dx treated patients versus placebo were achieved for both the primary and secondary endpoints 
in april we treated the first patient in a second phase study  known as edema the edema trial is a patient  multi center study being conducted at approximately sites in the united states 
the trial is being conducted as a double blind  placebo controlled study in which hae patients will receive a single mg sc dose of dx or placebo 
this trial  which is being conducted under a special protocol assessment  is intended to further support the validity of the patient reported outcome methodology used in the edema trial and further assess the efficacy and safety of dx an on going  open label continuation study is also being conducted to augment our clinical data with respect to dx in light of the data generated by the trials we have completed to date and assuming the successful completion of the edema trial  we now estimate regulatory approval of dx for hae in the united states in late  followed by approval in the european union 
given our familiarity with the hae market and its relatively small number of treating allergists  we believe the optimal commercialization strategy for the hae indication is to build an internal sales team to promote dx in the united states and to establish regional partnerships for distribution in other major market countries however  because regulatory approvals for new pharmaceutical products can be and often are significantly delayed or refused for numerous reasons  including those described under risk factors  dx may not be approved on the timeline we expect  or at all 
we estimate the total remaining costs to approval of dx for hae in the united states to be in the range of million to million 
as a result of the termination of our collaboration with genzyme in february  we are responsible for funding all of these costs 
under the terms of the termination agreement  we received all of the assets of dyax genzyme llc  including fixed assets  the rights to dx worldwide  and a million cash payment made by genzyme to the llc in connection with the termination  which is being used to fund development of dx for hae 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  in thousands dx for hae costs included within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss    net research and development expenses for dx for hae  equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net loss on dx for hae program    during  the research and development expenses on this program totaled million compared with million in and million in the million increase in spending from to is attributable to increased preclinical costs for additional toxicology studies  increased clinical study costs for the close out of edema and start up costs for edema and the continuation trial  and an increase in personnel expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million in over because expenses related to the manufacture of dx were not included as dx for hae costs in and in  approximately million of expenses were incurred to manufacture dx specifically for the hae program 
the decrease related to manufacturing was offset by an aggregate increase of million in clinical trial and internal costs over the same period 
dyax genzyme llc was responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program in the first quarter of until the termination of the llc on february  this reimbursement is recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
during  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us million for our expenses relating to the program 
for  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us for million of our expenses through the date of the termination 
in the first quarter of through the date of the termination dyax genzyme llc had net losses of approximately million 
these losses represented the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae in that portion of the first quarter of our portion of the losses  accounted for under the equity method  were million  million and million for the years ended december    and respectively  and were proportional to our financial interest in the program prior to the collaboration s termination 
our portion of the losses is separately classified as equity loss in joint venture on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
all expenditures on the program after february  are the sole responsibility of dyax and are included in research and development expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
dx for on pump cts we are currently developing dx as an alternate treatment for the prevention of blood loss in patients undergoing on pump cardiothoracic surgery on pump cts  specifically cabg and heart valve replacement or repair procedures 
in may  we initiated a phase  patient  randomized  placebo controlled trial that will be conducted at or more major us cardiac surgery centers 
expenses on this program totaled million  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in spending from to is attributable to clinical trial costs related to our phase study 
further development of dx in on pump cts will require large clinical trials and sizable development resources 
consequently  we have determined that the best way to advance dx in this indication would be through a strategic collaboration 
goals for clinical development programs our goal for both of our ongoing clinical development programs for dx is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international regulatory agencies 
material cash inflows for either of these programs  other than upfront and milestone payments from any collaboration we may enter into  will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product candidate finds acceptance in the marketplace as a treatment for its disease indication 
because of the many risks and uncertainties related to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever 
other biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs in addition to our drug candidates in clinical trials  our phage display technology and expertise has allowed us to develop a substantial pipeline of high quality drug candidates 
our goal is to maintain over ten ongoing therapeutic programs in our pipeline at all times 
of our existing pipeline candidates  the furthest developed are dx and dx  two fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential in oncology indications 
our dx antibody has a novel mechanism of action that targets the tie receptor on tumor blood vessels 
in preclinical animal models  dx has demonstrated activity against a broad range of solid tumor types 
data also indicates increased activity when combined with other antiangiogenic therapies  such as genentech s avastin and bayer s nexavar  and other chemotherapeutic agents 
in february  we entered into a license agreement with sanofi aventis  under which we granted sanofi aventis exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize dx as therapeutic product 
as a result of this license  we do not expect to incur any further costs in the development of dx our dx antibody is a novel protease inhibitor that specifically inhibits matrix metalloproteinase mmp on tumor cells and tumor blood vessels 
dx offers a potential treatment for a broad range of solid tumors 
it has been shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth  metastasis and angiogenesis in multiple preclinical models in a dose responsive manner 
in total  these programs represented approximately million and million in research and development expenses in and  respectively 
the decrease in these expenses is attributable to a decrease in activities for dx  as we were evaluating strategic partnership opportunities  which resulted in our agreement with sanofi aventis 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence if we will be able to enter into additional partnerships or otherwise internally develop any of these other preclinical drug candidates into marketable pharmaceutical products 
we monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently evaluate our pre clinical pipeline in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenue has come from licensing  funded research and development activities  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
this revenue fluctuates from year to year due to the nature of our agreements and our related activities 
total revenue for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million in revenue from to was primarily related to the recognition of million in revenue from a license agreement signed with morphosys ag in november this agreement  under which we granted morphosys a fully paid up license under our phage display patents and other patents  was structured to provide us with a significant up front payment 
additionally in  there was a million increase in revenue from library license agreements 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue associated with our former dx product collaboration with debiopharm  which concluded in the decrease of million in revenue from to was related to a million decrease in revenues associated with our former product collaboration with debiopharm  the recognition of a million milestone received in december from genzyme for initiating the edema trial of dx for hae and a million decrease in licensing activities due to the fact that our license fees included the recognition of a fully paid million patent license option fee 
under our amended agreement with debiopharm  signed in december  we are no longer responsible for manufacturing dx for debiopharm and have recognized no revenue from that program since the receipt and recognition of clinical milestones received from our collaborators and licensees may vary substantially from quarter to quarter due to the timing of their clinical activities 
research and development 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss    less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss    net research and development expenses per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss    equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss research and development expenses adjusted to include equity loss in joint venture    our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs  for our personnel dedicated to research and development activities and for the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research and clinical trials and to manufacture drug compounds prior to fda approval 
the expenses we incur on the dx program for hae are included in our overall research and development expenses  but expenses through february  were reimbursed by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture and excluded from net research and development expenses 
however  we jointly funded the losses of that program with genzyme  so our line item for equity loss in joint venture represents our share of all expenses for the development of dx for hae through february   including any incurred by genzyme 
in subsequent years there will be no reimbursement from the joint venture with genzyme nor any equity loss in the joint venture 
of the million increase in research and development expenses  million is attributable to dx for hae costs due to increases in clinical trial costs for edema and edema  increased personnel costs  additional preclinical toxicology studies  and increased manufacturing costs related to drug product validation studies 
the additional  increase in research and development expenses is attributable to an increase in clinical trial costs for dx in the on pump cts program  offset by a decrease in preclinical and small scale manufacturing costs associated with advancing the formal development of dx combining our net research and development expenses and our equity loss in joint venture to show our total expenses for research and development  our adjusted net research and development expenses increased million from to the due primarily to million increase in hae program costs and a decrease in reimbursement by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture 
the offsetting decrease in our equity loss in joint venture reflects the termination of the joint venture 
our adjusted net research and development expenses increased million from to primarily due to a million increase in net research and development expenses  offset by a million decrease in our equity loss in joint venture 
the million decrease in our equity loss in joint venture is primarily driven by the timing of manufacturing activities 
the million increase in our net research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the dx manufacturing validation campaign and increased preclinical and small scale manufacturing costs associated with advancing the formal development of dx additionally during the first quarter of we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation and recorded million of stock based compensation expense for in research and development expenses 
our management believes that the above presentation of adjusted net research and development expenses  although a non gaap measure  provides investors a better understanding of how total research and development efforts affected our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in prior year periods 
our presentation of this measure  however  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees  market research activities and the reporting requirements of a public company 
total general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase from to was due to increased r stock option expense  recruiting fees and other personnel costs 
the increase of million from to was due to increases in personnel costs  including million of stock based compensation expense following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation  which we adopted effective january  interest expense 
total interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in these increases are primarily due to interest under our agreement with paul royalty 
interest on this agreement is calculated using the effective interest method based on our expected future payments to paul royalty
