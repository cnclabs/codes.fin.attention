item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
management strategy the company s goal is to serve as a community oriented financial institution serving the northwestern new jersey  northeastern pennsylvania and orange county  new york marketplace 
our market presence has expanded by opening branch offices in port jervis and warwick  new york 
in addition  in the company received regulatory approval to open an office in milford  pennsylvania 
in june of  the company completed the relocation of its wantage  new jersey branch to its new site 
while offering traditional community bank loan and deposit products and services  the company obtains significant non interest income through its tri state insurance agency  inc tri state  insurance brokerage operations and the sale of non deposit products 
we report the operations of tri state as a separate segment from our commercial banking operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for december  included herein for more financial data regarding our two segments 
forward looking statements when used in this discussion the words believes  anticipates  contemplated  expects or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
those risks and uncertainties include changes to interest rates  the ability to control costs and expenses  the company s ability to integrate new technology into its operations  general economic conditions  the success of the company s efforts to diversify its revenue base by developing additional sources of non interest income while continuing to manage its existing fee based business  the impact of changing statutory and regulatory requirements on the company and the risks inherent in integrating acquisitions into the company and commencing operations in new markets 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after this date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for december  included herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effect cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
management s judgment is based on the evaluation of the past experience of individual loans  the assessment of current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
loan losses are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 

index management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows  and other relevant factors 
since the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses is dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control  it is possible that management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
additionally  a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively impact earnings 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
they may require additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
future increases to our allowance for loan losses  whether due to unexpected changes in economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our future results of operations 
stock based compensation 
the company currently has several stock option plans in place for employees and directors of the company 
the company accounts for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on a grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
r 
the company had  unvested stock options at december   therefore  the adoption of fasb statement no 
r relates to these unvested stock options and any stock options granted after january  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has recorded goodwill of million at december  related to the acquisition of tri state insurance agency on october  and thousand from the acquisition of the port jervis  new york branch office on march  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense  but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill require additional impairment testing 
the company performs its annual impairment test on the goodwill of tri state in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value  no write downs of goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of goodwill 
the company determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance could result in different assessments of the fair value and could result in impairment charges in the future 
investment securities impairment evaluation 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investments in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value

impact of inflation and changing prices unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  the level of interest rate has a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general levels of inflation

accordingly  the liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics of the company s asset and liabilities are more indicative of its ability to maintain acceptable performance levels 
management of the company monitors and seeks to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes by attempting to match the maturities of assets and liabilities to gap  thus seeking to minimize the potential effect of inflation
