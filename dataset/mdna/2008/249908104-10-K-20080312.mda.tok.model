item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated products that address large and growing markets and are based on proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
we have developed two commercial products 
glumetza metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes 
proquin xr ciprofloxacin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections that we commercialize in the united states with watson pharma 
we have a three pronged approach to product development designed to optimize the use and value of our drug delivery technologies  while managing the costs and risks associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
we develop products for our own account that are designed to compete in large growing markets and that can be highly differentiated from immediate release versions of the compounds upon which they are based 
second  we selectively enter into collaborative partnerships with other companies where the unique capabilities of our technology can provide superior value to a partner s compound  resulting in significantly greater value for depomed than a traditional fee for service arrangement 
third  we enter into arrangements that enable our technology to be applied by other companies to a greater number of compounds than our infrastructure can support  so as to derive additional value from our technology 
in the future  we plan to commercialize our proprietary products  relying on partners to cover the large primary care audiences  while maintaining co promotion and distribution rights in order to be in a position to create our own sales force when appropriate  thereby increasing the value to us of our products  and our control over them 
our most advanced product candidate in development is gabapentin gr  an extended release form of gabapentin 
with respect to gabapentin gr  we have completed a phase clinical trial for the treatment of women with menopausal hot flashes 
we have also initiated a phase clinical trial for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia 
in addition  we have other product candidates in earlier stages of development  including a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and royalties earned on license agreements and collaborative arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we sell glumetza and proquin xr product to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we began selling glumetza in september  and we relaunched proquin xr in october our returns policy allows product returns within the period beginning six months prior to expiration and ending twelve months following product expiration 
given our limited history of selling glumetza and proquin xr  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of glumetza and proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time glumetza and proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
we have not had significant history estimating the number of patient prescriptions dispensed 
if we underestimate or overestimate patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period  adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods 
as a result of this policy  we recognized million in product sales  which is net of wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs  chargebacks and medicaid rebates for the year ended december  we have a deferred revenue balance of million at december  related to glumetza and proquin xr product shipments that have not been recognized as revenue  which is net of wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
we will recognize revenue upon the earlier of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns  at which time we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
in addition  the costs of manufacturing glumetza and proquin xr associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues from product sales are recorded net of wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
these gross to net sales adjustments are recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized and are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
we believe our estimates related to gross to net sales adjustments for wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs and chargebacks do not have a high degree of estimation complexity or uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time 
we do consider our estimates related to medicaid rebates to be more complex 
however  they have historically not been material amounts 
if medicaid reimbursement for our products increases or we enter into new managed care contracts for our products  these estimates may be material in future periods 
revenue from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
license fee payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation as of january   we began accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
for our volatility assumption  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
we have concluded that our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and therefore  as of january   we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
fas r requires that employee and director stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
prior to january   we measured compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
under apb no 
 no stock based compensation was recognized for the espp or for option grants when the exercise price of the options granted was equal to or greater than the fair value market price of the stock on the grant date 
in accordance with the provisions of fas r  we eliminated the balance of the deferred compensation calculated under apb no 
to the common stock account on january  fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
prior to the adoption of fas r  pro forma information required under fas included forfeitures as they occurred 
results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized in the following table in thousands product sales glumetza  proquin xr  total product sales   royalties glumetza proquin xr   total royalties   license revenue glumetza   proquin xr   acuform technology total license revenue   collaborative revenue total revenues    product sales we began selling glumetza to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in september and defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of glumetza until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time glumetza units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on glumetza product shipments  which is net of estimated wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
in october  we terminated our promotion agreement related to glumetza with king and king s promotion obligations ended in december in february  we began detailing glumetza through a contract sales organization  as we do not have an established sales organization 
we expect product sales for glumetza to increase in  however  this may be dependent on the success of our contract sales organization as well as the timing of  or the ability to find one or more commercialization partners for glumetza 
proquin xr product sales in and relate to our supply agreement with esprit 
we began supplying esprit with commercial quantities of proquin xr in the fourth quarter of in  there were no sales pursuant to the supply agreement 
we terminated the license and supply agreements with esprit in july and the marketing and distribution rights in the united states for proquin xr reverted back to us 
in october  we re launched proquin xr with watson  and began selling to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on proquin xr product shipments  which is net of estimated wholesaler fees  stocking allowances  prompt payment discounts  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
we expect product sales of proquin xr to increase in royalties our agreements with esprit provided for royalty payments by esprit to us of percent to percent of proquin xr net sales in the united states  based on escalating net sales and subject to certain minimum royalty amounts 
esprit s minimum royalty amount for was million and under our amended license agreement entered into in july  amounts paid by esprit for royalties were creditable against the minimum royalty obligation 
net sales of proquin xr by esprit for and did not reach levels that would obligate esprit to pay an amount greater than the minimum royalty obligation  and accordingly  esprit paid us million in total royalties for and in july  we terminated our license agreement with esprit  and esprit paid us million in royalties  representing a pro rated amount of minimum royalties that would have been due to us under the original agreements 
esprit is no longer obligated to pay us royalties on proquin xr sales 
glumetza royalties relate to royalties we received from biovail based on net sales of glumetza in canada and royalties we received from lg based on net sales of lg s version of glumetza  novamet gr  in korea 
we began receiving royalties from biovail in the first quarter of and from lg in the first quarter of as a result of the termination of the esprit agreements  we expect royalty revenue to decrease in license revenue our license agreement with esprit for proquin xr provided for million in license fees from esprit 
we received million in license fees in july and an additional million in december the final million installment was due in july the first million in license fees received were recognized as revenue ratably commencing on our receipt of the fees through june  which represented the length of time we were obligated to manufacture proquin xr under our proquin xr supply agreement with esprit 
in july  we and esprit terminated the license and supply agreements 
as a result of the termination of our agreements with esprit  we no longer have continuing obligations to esprit 
accordingly  all deferred revenue related to license fees previously received from esprit was fully recognized as revenue in july  resulting in recognition of approximately million of license revenue 
in addition  the final million payment received in july was fully recognized as license revenue on receipt  resulting in total recognition of million of license revenue related to our agreements with esprit during the third quarter of we received million in glumetza license fees from biovail in july we are recognizing the million license fee payment as revenue ratably until february  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay biovail on net sales of glumetza in the united states and for our obligation to use biovail as our sole supplier of the mg glumetza  should the mg glumetza obtain approval in the united states 
at december   we have million remaining in deferred revenue related to this agreement 
we received a million upfront license fee from lg in august and a million milestone payment received in november with respect to lg s approval to market novamet gr in the republic of korea 
these payments were originally deferred and amortized as license revenue over the estimated length of time we were obligated to provide assistance in development and manufacturing 
in january  we amended our agreement with lg  granted lg a license to certain of the company s intellectual property rights to manufacture the mg novamet gr in exchange for royalties on net sales of novamet gr in korea  and removed the provisions of the original agreement providing for the supply of mg novamet gr tablets by us to lg 
under the amended agreement  we no longer have continuing performance obligations that are other than inconsequential or perfunctory to lg 
accordingly  the remaining million of previously deferred revenue was recognized as license revenue in the first quarter of in february  we received million from biovail upon entering into a license and development agreement with biovail granting biovail an option to license our acuform drug delivery technology to develop and commercialize up to two pharmaceutical products 
we have no continuing performance obligations that are other than inconsequential or perfunctory under the agreement 
accordingly  we have recognized the entire upfront license fee as revenue in the first quarter of as a result of the termination of the esprit agreements  we expect license revenue to decrease in collaborative revenue collaborative revenue decreased in from as a result of services performed for esprit  which were completed in collaborative revenue decreased in from as a result of services performed in under our agreement with boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  which were completed in december cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  contract manufacturing and packaging costs  product quality testing  internal employee costs related to the manufacturing process  distribution costs and shipping costs related to our product sales 
total costs of sales are summarized in the following table in thousands cost of sales   cost of sales increased in over primarily as a result of an increase in glumetza product sales and increased in over as a result of an increase in supply of proquin xr to esprit 
the costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on glumetza and proquin xr product shipments are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product launch 
total research and development expense for the each of the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands research and development expense    dollar change from prior year   percentage change from prior year in and  the majority of our research and development expense was related to gabapentin gr 
the decrease in research and development expense in from was primarily due to reduced expense related to the completion of our phase clinical trials for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia partially offset by the commencement of a phase clinical trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes in the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily due to completion of our phase and commencement of our phase clinical trials for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and completion of our phase clinical trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
the adoption of fas r on january  resulted in an increase in stock compensation expense of million for we categorize our research and development expense by project

partnered with supernus pharmaceuticals  inc two undisclosed compounds confidential preclinical studies 
the compound and indication may not be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the applicable collaboration agreement 
we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states  assuming that we are successful 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
in march  we commenced an additional phase trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia  and expect to commence a phase trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes either alone or with a collaborative partner  which may result in increased research and development expense in the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after approval  which are known as phase trials 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses to support our operating activities  marketing and promotion expenses associated with glumetza  facility costs and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
total selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows selling  general and administrative expenses   dollar change from prior year   percentage change from prior year in  we announced our determination to evolve from a solely product development focused company to an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company with sales and marketing of our own products 
preliminary staffing for these activities began in in and  we enhanced our internal sales and marketing capabilities through the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees and the engagement of consultants 
we anticipate the build up of our commercial infrastructure will continue over the next several years 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in expense related to marketing costs associated with glumetza  an increase of million in legal fees due to our patent infringement case against ivax and an increase of million increase in promotion fees due to king under the promotion agreement related to glumetza 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to approximately million in expense related to marketing costs associated with glumetza  which was launched in september  million in related promotion fees due to king under the promotion agreement related to glumetza  an increase of million in legal fees due to our patent infringement case against ivax  and an increase in stock compensation expense of million as a result of the adoption of fas r on january  we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will be flat or slightly higher in from levels  but this may change based on the terms of any agreement  if any  that we may enter into with a promotion partner with respect to glumetza 
interest income and expense interest income    interest expense net interest income expense   interest income increased in over due to higher investment balances in resulting from of our receipt of million in termination fees from king and million in license and termination fees from esprit in the second half of interest income increased in over due to higher investment balances in resulting from of our receipt of license fees from esprit and biovail in and also due to higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
interest expense in was mainly due to interest on a promissory note  issued to elan corporation plc  or elan 
the note was fully repaid in june gain on termination of king promotion agreement in conjunction with the termination and assignment agreement entered into with king in october  we received a million termination payment from king  of which million has been classified as a gain within operating income for the year ended december  gain on termination of esprit pharma agreement in conjunction with the termination and assignment agreement entered into with esprit in july  we received a million termination payment from esprit  which has been classified as a gain within operating income for the year ended december  gain from extinguishment of debt in connection with the formation of ddl  an elan joint venture  elan made a loan facility available to us for up to million in principal to support our share of the joint venture s research and development costs pursuant to a convertible promissory note issued by us to elan 
the funding term of the loan expired in november the note had a six year term  was due in january  and bore interest at per annum  compounded semi annually  on any amounts borrowed under the facility 
however  in june  we repurchased the promissory note with an outstanding balance of million  including million of accrued interest  for million including commissions paid to a financial consultant and legal fees 
a gain on the extinguishment of the debt of million was recorded in other income in series a preferred stock and deemed dividends in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share 
the series a preferred stock accrued a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock was convertible at anytime between january and january into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was 
however  as a result of our march and october financings  the conversion price was adjusted to per share 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the series a preferred shareholder to resolve a misunderstanding between us and the shareholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock the december agreement 
pursuant to the december agreement  among other matters  we agreed to adjust the conversion price to per share 
we and the shareholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the series a conversion price 
prior to december  the amounts calculated as series a preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

as a result of the december agreement  we determined that a significant modification of the preferred stock agreement had occurred  and  therefore  a new commitment date was established for the series a preferred stock 
further  we determined that the fair value of the modified preferred stock was below the carrying value of such securities as of the date of the modification  therefore  no deemed dividend resulted from this modification 
also  we determined that although a new commitment date had been established  this change did not result in a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
however  an anti dilution provision of the series a preferred stock was triggered by our january financing  which adjusted the conversion price of the series a preferred stock to 
as a result of the adjusted conversion price and an increase in the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock due to additional accumulated dividends  the series a preferred stock now contains a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
in conjunction with the modification of the agreement  we issued a warrant to the series a preferred shareholder 
the value of the warrant was considered in determining the value of the modified security 
the warrant is convertible into shares of our common stock during the period between january and january the conversion price of the warrant initially was  which was equal to the series a preferred stock conversion price in effect as of january  the conversion price of the warrant decreases by approximately per year during the conversion period  such that the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the warrant will increase by approximately per year 
the conversion of the warrant may be satisfied only by surrender of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock accrued dividends through january   the date the warrant initially became exercisable 
as a result of the issuance of the warrant  the preferred stock may be surrendered in exchange for common stock for an additional three years through january  as long as the series a preferred stock remains outstanding  the number of shares into which the warrant can be converted increases as the conversion price of the warrant decreases resulting in additional deemed dividends on the series a preferred stock 
for the years ended december   and we recognized series a preferred stock deemed dividends of approximately million  million and million  respectively  attributable to the beneficial conversion feature from the accrued dividends and decreasing warrant price 
we will continue to recognize series a preferred stock deemed dividends until the earlier of the time the series a preferred stock is surrendered or january as of december   there were  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
the warrant was convertible into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of as of december  liquidity and capital resources as of december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands since inception through december   we have financed our product development efforts and operations primarily from private and public sales of equity securities and receipts of upfront license and termination fees from collaborative and license partners 
in december  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity  ltd  pursuant to which azimuth is committed to purchase  from time to time and at our sole discretion  up to the lesser of a million of our common stock  or b  shares of common stock 
sales to azimuth under the agreement  if any  will occur over a month term and will be made at a price equal to the average closing price of our common stock over a given pricing period  minus a discount ranging from approximately to  which varies based on a threshold price set by us 
upon each sale of the our common stock to azimuth under the agreement  we have also agreed to pay reedland capital partners a placement fee equal to approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
as of december   we have not sold any common stock to azimuth under this common stock purchase agreement 
in april  we completed a registered direct offering of  shares of common stock with institutional investors 
the shares were sold at a price of approximately per share  with net proceeds totaling approximately million 
in july  esprit paid us million in connection with the termination of our license and supply agreement related to proquin xr 
in october  king paid us million in connection with the termination of our promotion agreement with glumetza 
as of december   we have accumulated net losses of million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least the end of we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including sales of our marketed products  expenditures related to our commercialization and development efforts  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into  if any  results of research and development efforts  results of our litigation against ivax  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses  products or technologies
