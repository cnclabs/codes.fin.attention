underwriting 
the company s ability to write both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers 
the company s strategy is to lead in as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible 
the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price  terms and conditions 
management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates 
when the company does not lead the treaty  it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty 
the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors 
the company s treaty underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the company s underwriters  actuaries and claim staff 
treaties are reviewed for compliance with the company s general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated  in part  based upon actuarial analyses by the company 
the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience 
the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties 
the company does  however  evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty 
the company  when appropriate  also conducts underwriting  operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines 
underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff  pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time 
claim audits  when appropriate  are performed in order to evaluate the client s claims handling abilities and practices 
the company s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks  limits and maximum risk exposures 
specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest re s new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients 
in addition  the company s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits  complexity or volatility  regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract 
non us risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations 
the company s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers 
these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager s capabilities 
the company s rates  forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types 
the company s underwriting  actuarial  claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms 
risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements underwriting risk and accumulation controls 
each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines 
these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors  including ceding company profile  line of business  geographic location and risk hazards 
in each case  the guidelines permit limited exceptions  which must be authorized by the company s senior management 
management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions  risk versus reward analyses and the company s underwriting risk management processes 
the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses 
the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by selective underwriting practices  diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business  limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones  purchasing retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured cost effectively 
see retrocession arrangements 
like other insurance and reinsurance companies  the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence  whether a natural event  such as a hurricane or an earthquake  or other catastrophe  such as an explosion at a major factory 
a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties  facultative certificates and across lines of business 
the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events 
accordingly  the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas 
these techniques range from non modeled deterministic approaches  such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors  to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis 
no single universal model is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business 
in addition  the form  quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the company s licensed models  which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections 
further  the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units 
the combination of techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of the company s estimates 
also  while most models have been updated to better incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses in and  such as flood  storm surge and demand surge  catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise 
in addition  uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data 
nevertheless  when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment  catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events 
projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated loss  taking into account contract terms and limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake 
the pml will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make up of the in force book of business 
the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods  such as year events and year events 
for example  a year pml corresponds to the estimated loss from a single event which has a probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period 
conversely  it corresponds to a probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml 
it is important to note that pmls are estimates 
modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model 
as a result  there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml 
from an enterprise risk management perspective  management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite 
the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to the company s financial resources and expected earnings and risk reward analyses of the business being underwritten 
as of january   management estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest year event does not exceed million or about of shareholders equity 
economic loss is the gross pml reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and income taxes 
the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity  which is also affected by inter affiliate reinsurance 
management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve  such as loss amounts at the     and  year return periods 
this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk  underwriting and capital management decisions 
the company s catastrophe loss projections  segmented by risk zones  are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process 
the table below reflects the company s pre tax pmls at various return times for its top three zones perils as ranked by the largest in year events based on loss projection data as of january  return periods in years in in in in in in  exceeding probability dollars in millions zone area  peril southeast us  wind europe  wind northeast us  wind the company purchases limited amounts of retrocessional coverage 
while the company considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the availability of cost effective protection  there was no such retrocessional coverage in place at january  the company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in the marketplace 
the projected economic losses for the three highest in pml losses in the above table are as follows for the southeast us wind storm  million  for the european wind storm  million and for the northeast us wind storm  million 
the projection for the southeast wind storm does not consider potential impacts from the florida insurance reform that increases insurers access to the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance purchased from the private reinsurance markets 
the company is unable to predict if this will reduce future reinsurance coverage in florida and correspondingly reduce the pml for a southeast wind storm 
the company believes that its methods of monitoring  analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework  which can be integrated with its underwriting business and capital management activities 
however  there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections  perhaps by a material amount 
nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones  or multiple severe events that could  in the aggregate  exceed the company s pml expectations by a significant amount 
terrorism risk 
the company does not have significant exposure to losses from terrorism risk 
while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering events of terrorism  the company s risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for properties or in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists 
although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable  most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage 
as a result  the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its us insurance book of business  particularly its workers compensation policies  however  the company generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk 
as a result of its limited exposure  the company does not believe the us terrorism risk insurance act of that was signed into law november and amended in december and december has had or will have a significant impact on its operations 
retrocession arrangements 
the company considers retrocessional agreements to reduce its exposure on specific business written and potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
where reinsurance is purchased  the agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses and lae from retrocessionaires 
the level of retrocessional coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
all retrocessional purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
no assurance can be given that the company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in the past 
the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written  but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and or cost effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed 
the company also participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies  including the ceding company  with respect to the involved treaties 
the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the us insurance segment 
the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures  individual program exposures  aggregate exposures by line of business  overall segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance 
facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business 
the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective retrocessional protection 
for years ended december   and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to million of coverage for each year 
these excess of loss policies provided coverage if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified attachment point for each year of coverage 
the attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the company to offset  on a pre tax income basis  up to approximately of such ceded losses 
the maximum recovery for each year was million before giving effect to the adjustable premium and the company had ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts 
the company has not purchased similar corporate level coverage subsequent to december all of the company s retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore  are accounted for as reinsurance under statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mt 
mckinley in september  the company obtained coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by prudential property and casualty insurance company of indiana prupac  a wholly owned subsidiary of the prudential 
on october   lm property casualty insurance company lm completed its purchase of prupac and its obligations from the prudential 
the prudential continues to guarantee lm s obligation under this agreement 
this agreement covers  or million  of the first million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of mt 
mckinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the company as such losses are paid by the company 
cessions under this reinsurance agreement had exhausted the limit available under the contract as of december  at december   the company carried as an asset million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded 
of this amount  million  or  was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic  million  or  was receivable from founders insurance company limited founders  for which the company has established million provision for uncollectible reinsurance  million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental  million  or  was receivable from munich reinsurance company munich re  million  or  was receivable from lm  million  or  was receivable from ace property and casualty insurance company ace and million  or  was receivable from berkley insurance company berkley 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
although management carefully selects its reinsurers  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
the company s arrangements with continental are managed on a funds held basis  which means that the company has retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire  recorded them as a liability  credited interest on the balances at a stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments become due 
as of december  and  such funds had reduced the company s net exposure to continental to million and million  respectively 
claims 
reinsurance claims are managed by the company s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues  monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies  establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims 
in addition to claims assessment  processing and payment  the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies 
insurance claims  except those relating to mt 
mckinley s business  are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the company s professional claims staff 
the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental a e exposures through dedicated  centrally managed claim staffs for mt 
mckinley and everest re 
both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures 
these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account  responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate 
specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management  actuarial  legal and financial areas 
senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the company s overall reserve positions and make changes  if appropriate 
the company continually reviews its internal processing  communications and analytics  seeking to enhance the management of its a e exposures  in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation 
reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 
significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves  which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred 
actual losses and lae paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves 
to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage  the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings  which could be material in the period such recognition takes place 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and lae reserves 
as part of the reserving process  insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts  changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends 
while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future 
as a result  actual losses and lae may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years  which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income in the periods in which the adjustments were made 
there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income 
changes in historical reserves 
the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for and subsequent years 
the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the company s loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars  the impact of which is not material 
the top line of the table shows the estimated initial reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date 
the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end 
the lower liability re estimated portion shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves as of the end of each succeeding year 
the reserve estimates are revised as more information becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried 
the cumulative deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability 
since the company has international operations  some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to us dollars for financial reporting 
changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the us dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly  the cumulative deficiency line of the table 
however  unlike other reserve development that affects net income  the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income 
to differentiate these two reserve development components  the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of effects on pre tax income resulting from reserve re estimates 
each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  if a loss settled in for  was first reserved in at  and remained unchanged until settlement  the  deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in the period through conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future developments 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
ten year gaap loss development table presented net of reinsurance with supplemental gross data dollars in millions net reserves for unpaid loss and lae paid cumulative as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net liability re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative deficiency gross liability end of year reinsurance receivable net liability end of year gross re estimated liability at at december  re estimated receivable at december  net re estimated liability at december  gross cumulative deficiency includes million relating to mt

the canadian branch reserves are reflected in canadian dollars 
some totals may not reconcile due to rounding 
every year in the above table reflects a cumulative deficiency  also referred to as adverse development  with the largest indicated cumulative deficiency in three classes of business were the principal contributors to those deficiencies the run off of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented  professional liability reinsurance  general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for years through  and property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for in response to its recent asbestos experience  and in view of industry asbestos experience  the company completed a detailed study of its experience and its cedants exposures and also considered recent industry trends 
the company s claims department undertook a contract by contract analysis of its direct business and projected those findings to its assumed reinsurance business 
the company s actuaries utilized nine methodologies to project its potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on internal data and assessments  extrapolations of non public and publicly available data for the company s cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience 
as a result of this study  the company increased its gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by million and increased its gross direct asbestos reserves by million in the fourth quarter of these reserve increases  as well as adverse development on asbestos in prior years  have a significant impact on the cumulative deficiencies 
absent the asbestos development  only years through would reflect cumulative deficiencies on net reserves  with the remaining years reflecting cumulative redundancies 
in the professional liability reinsurance class  the late s and early s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate  financial and or management improprieties 
this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the company 
in the general casualty area  the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the company s pricing and reserving assumptions  particularly for accident years and in the workers compensation insurance class  the majority of which was written in california  the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years and due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity 
as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment  the company s writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established and or stable lines of business 
although cumulative results through continue to be quite profitable for this book of business  there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these statements regarding the company s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor disclosure 
the following table is derived from the ten year gaap loss development table above and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended december  each column represents the amount of net reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re estimates for the indicated accident years 
since the company has operations in many countries  part of the company s loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period 
fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies  period over period  affect the us dollar amount of outstanding reserves 
the translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re estimates

this adjustment converts canadian dollars to us dollars 
the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table 
the unfavorable development experienced in the and prior and accident years relates principally to the previously discussed asbestos development 
other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance  including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance  where  in retrospect  the company s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures 
the favorable development for accident years through relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business 
in addition  casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years to the unfavorable development experienced in the accident year was principally due to reserve increases for one credit insurance program 
the company s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends  seeking  on a timely basis  to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the company s underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis 
the following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the periods indicated on a gaap basis reconciliation of reserves for losses and lae years ended december  dollars in millions gross reserves at beginning of period incurred related to current year prior years total incurred losses paid related to current year prior years total paid losses foreign exchange translation adjustment change in reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and lae gross reserves at end of period development of prior year incurred losses was million unfavorable in  million unfavorable in and million favorable in such losses were the result of the reserve development discussed above  as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves 
reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses 
at december   of the company s gross reserves reflected an estimate of the company s ultimate liability for a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
the company s a e liabilities stem from mt 
mckinley s direct insurance business and everest re s assumed reinsurance business 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asbestos and environmental exposures and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mt 
mckinley s book of direct a e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous 
it also arises from a limited period  effective to the book is based principally on excess liability policies  thereby limiting exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms 
as a result of this focused structure  the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures  allowing it to identify  analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure  including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non products asbestos claims 
the company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt 
mckinley 
such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement  negotiation  litigation  or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place sip agreements 
sip agreements generally condition an insurer s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer s payments 
the company s mt 
mckinley operation is currently managing eight sip agreements  three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in the company s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments  because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty 
the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time  as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active 
those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous  but still active management  with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics  which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity 
the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders  including those that may not have reported significant a e losses 
everest re s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a e exposed relationships 
it also arises from a limited period  effectively to because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a e exposures for many years  its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities 
the company s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies 
this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company s analysis of its exposure through those companies 
as a result  the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as non products asbestos claims  for concentrated attention 
however  in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities  the company relies on claims data supplied  both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers 
this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the company s ultimate loss projections 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s total reserves for a e losses  gross and net of reinsurance  for the periods indicated years ended december  dollars in millions case reserves reported by ceding companies additional case reserves established by the company assumed reinsurance case reserves established by the company direct insurance incurred but not reported reserves gross reserves reinsurance receivable net reserves additional reserves are case specific reserves determined by the company to be needed over and above those reported by the ceding company 
additional losses  including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures  which are as yet unrecognized  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry  may emerge in the future 
such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future policy benefit reserves 
the company writes a limited amount of life and annuity reinsurance in its bermuda segment 
future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts 
reserves for those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and annuity claims  both reported and unreported

the board of directors of each of the company s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and  together with senior management  for overseeing their execution 
the company s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio 
considering these objectives  the company views its investment portfolio as having two components  the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and investments funded by the company s shareholders equity 
for outstanding liabilities  the company invests in taxable and tax preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa  as rated by moody s investors service  inc moody s 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and the company s tax position 
this fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent  professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company 
over the past few years  the company has reallocated its equity investment portfolio to include publicly traded equity securities and private equity limited partnership investments 
the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes 
the company has limited its allocation to these asset classes because of the potential for volatility in their values and the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models 
at december   the market or fair value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated of shareholders equity 
the company s fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments 
this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management  which considers economic and business factors  as well as the company s average duration of potential liabilities  which  at december   is estimated at approximately years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations 
the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december  was years  down from years at prior year end 
this shortened duration mainly reflects the company s elevated short term investment holdings in response to relatively low interest rates combined with a flat to negative yield curve during for each currency in which the company has established substantial reserves  the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated liabilities 
approximately of the company s consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies 
the company s overall financial strength and results of operations are  in part  dependent on the quality and performance of its investment portfolio 
net investment income and net realized capital gains losses on the company s invested assets constituted  and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily attributable to the company s adoption of fair value accounting for its actively managed equity security investment portfolio 
basically  fair value accounting reports changes in the value as realized capital gains or losses on the statement of operations rather than other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
the company had million  or of the company s revenues  of fair value re measurements included in net realized capital gains in the company s cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   which consisted of fixed maturities and cash of which were investment grade  equity securities and other invested assets 
the average maturity of fixed maturities was years at december   and their overall duration was years 
at december   the company s fixed maturity portfolio included million in book value of asset backed securities with sub prime mortgage loan exposure 
sub prime mortgage loans generally represent loans made to borrowers with limited or blemished credit records 
at december  almost of the company s asset backed securities with sub prime exposure were investment grade and the market value of these investments was million 
as of december   the company did not have any direct investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments other than equity index put options as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the company s management believes could threaten the issuer s ability to meet debt service payments  except where other than temporary impairments have been recognized

financial strength ratings 
the following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the company s operating subsidiaries as reported by am best  standard poor s rating services standard poor s and moody s 
these ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company 
all of the below mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised  if necessary  by each of the rating agencies 
the company believes that its ratings  in general  have become increasingly important to its operations because they provide the company s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the company s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons 
strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies 
ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future 
as a result  a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred 
operating subsidiary am best standard poor s moody s everest re a superior aa very strong aa excellent bermuda re a superior aa very strong aa excellent everest international a superior not rated not rated everest national a superior aa very strong not rated everest indemnity a superior not rated not rated everest security a superior not rated not rated mt 
mckinley not rated not rated not rated am best states that the a superior rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders based on am best s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile 
standard poor s states that the aa rating is assigned to those insurance companies which  in its opinion  have very strong financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms 
moody s states that insurance companies rated aa offer excellent financial security 
together with the aaa rated companies  aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high grade companies  with aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long term risks 
subsidiaries other than everest re and bermuda re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary s operations 
in particular  mt 
mckinley is not rated because it is in run off status 
debt ratings 
the following table shows the debt ratings by am best  standard poor s and moody s of the holdings senior notes due march  and october  and long term notes due may  and everest re capital trust ii s capital trust ii trust preferred securities due march   all of which are considered investment grade 
debt ratings are a current assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation 
am best standard poor s moody s senior notes a excellent a strong security a good security trust preferred securities bbb good bbb adequate baa adequate security long term notes bbb good bbb adequate baa adequate security a debt rating of a or a is assigned by am best where the issuer  in am best s opinion  has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation 
a debt rating of a is assigned by standard poor s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories 
standard poor s assigns a debt rating of bbb to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
according to moody s  a debt rating of a is assigned to issues that are considered upper medium grade obligations and subject to low credit risk 
obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics 
competition 
the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  as well as cyclical by product and market 
as a result  financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability  high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity  low rates and constrained profitability 
competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the company underwrites is based on many factors  including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer  ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best and or standard poor s  underwriting expertise  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered  premiums charged  other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered  services offered  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written 
furthermore  the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business  domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels 
the company competes in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors 
the company s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
in  the company observed increased competition with slightly reduced rates  higher commissions and demands by cedants for improved terms and conditions 
the extent of the increased competition and its effect on rates  terms and conditions varied widely by market and coverage types 
one of the lesser impacted markets was property catastrophe retrocessional coverage in regions that were most affected by the catastrophe events of  principally hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
reinsurance capacity in areas including southeastern us exposures and energy lines continued to be constrained 
in january  the state of florida passed legislation that increased coverage provided by the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance that florida companies will purchase from the private reinsurance market 
in addition  the legislature broadened the mandate of the state sponsored homeowners insurance company to render it a fully competitive market participant 
although the company is unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative developments  the company believes that its clients continue to write profitable business in florida and will continue to purchase both quota share and catastrophe coverage  although at likely lower volumes 
the balance of the us and international property lines experienced mostly modest price declines but the company believes they are still adequately priced 
the company s us and international casualty lines experienced weaker market conditions  led by the medical stop loss and d o reinsurance classes  as well as the california workers compensation insurance line 
the company believes that us casualty reinsurance generally remains adequately priced 
the company also believes that increased primary price competition and cedants increased appetite for retaining more profitable business net  following several highly profitable years  have resulted in modestly softer  but still profitable  reinsurance pricing 
the company s us insurance operation was also affected by these primary casualty insurance market conditions  however  given the specialty nature of the company s business  it believes the impact on the company to be less severe than on the market generally 
the company is unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from increased competition and legislative initiatives 
in addition to these market forces  reinsurers continue to reassess their risk appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to obtain a greater spread of risk against the backdrop of i recent revisions to the industry s catastrophe loss projection models  which are indicating significantly higher loss potentials and consequently higher pricing requirements  and ii elevated rating agency scrutiny and capital requirements for many catastrophe exposed companies 
in light of the company s catastrophe experience  it has re examined its risk management practices and concluded that the control framework operated generally as intended 
the company rebalanced its property portfolio  particularly within peak catastrophe zones  including the southeast us  mexico and gulf of mexico 
this effort has enabled the company to benefit from market dislocations by carefully shifting the mix of its writings toward the most profitable classes  lines  customers and territories and by enhancing its portfolio balance and diversification 
overall  the company believes that current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for it  given its strong ratings  distribution system  reputation and expertise 
the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential  while maintaining balance and diversification on its overall portfolio 
employees 
as of february   the company employed persons 
management believes that employee relations are good 
none of the company s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements  and the company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements 
regulatory matters 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business  including essentially all states of the us  canada  singapore  the united kingdom and bermuda 
these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the company s conduct of business  financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations 
many of these regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the company s performance 
insurance holding company regulation 
under applicable us laws and regulations  no person  corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the company  unless such person  corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of delaware and the other states in which the company s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled  currently california and georgia 
under these laws  control is presumed when any person acquires  directly or indirectly  or more of the voting securities of an insurance company 
to obtain the approval of any change in control  the proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing  among other things  the background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers  the acquirer s financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company 
us state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter affiliate transactions within the holding company structure 
the insurance companies act of canada requires prior approval by the minister of finance of anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in canada 
in addition  the company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business 
certain of these states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above 
dividends 
under bermuda law  group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium additional paid in capital accounts 
group s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under bermuda law as well as the laws of the various us states in which group s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled 
the limitations are generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders surplus or minimum solvency and liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices 
as holdings has outstanding debt obligations  it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and to pay dividends to group 
under bermuda law  bermuda re is unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
as a long term insurer  bermuda re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless  after payment of the dividend  the value of the assets in its long term business fund  as certified by its approved actuary  exceeds its liabilities for long term business by at least the  minimum solvency margin 
prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority is required if bermuda re s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory capital by or more 
at december   bermuda re and everest international exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin 
the payment of dividends to holdings by everest re is subject to limitations imposed by delaware law 
generally  everest re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus  which was  million at december   and only after it has given days prior notice to the delaware insurance commissioner 
during this day period  the commissioner may  by order  limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress 
further  the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the delaware insurance commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of of the insurer s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or the insurer s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year 
accordingly  the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by everest re in without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is million 
insurance regulation 
neitherbermuda re nor everest international is admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the us both conduct their insurance business from their offices in bermuda  and in the case of bermuda re  its branch in the uk 
in bermuda  bermuda re and everest international are regulated by the insurance act as amended and related regulations the act 
the act establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects bermuda re and everest international to the supervision  investigation and intervention powers of the bermuda monetary authority 
under the act  bermuda re and everest international  as class insurers  are each required to maintain a principal office in bermuda  to maintain a minimum of million in statutory capital and surplus  to have an independent auditor approved by the bermuda monetary authority conduct an annual audit and report on their respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss reserve specialist also approved by the bermuda monetary authority review and report on their respective loss reserves annually 
bermuda re is also registered under the act as a long term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity business 
as a long term insurer  bermuda re is required to maintain  in statutory capital separate from its class minimum statutory capital and surplus  to maintain a long term business fund  to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually 
bermuda re s operations in the united kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the financial services authority the fsa 
the fsa imposes solvency  capital adequacy  audit  financial reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the united kingdom 
bermuda re presently meets or exceeds all of the fsa s solvency and capital requirements 
us domestic property and casualty insurers  including reinsurers  are subject to regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed 
the regulation of reinsurers is typically focused on financial condition  investments  management and operation 
the rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to direct regulation by any governmental authority 
the operations of everest re s foreign branch offices in canada and singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those jurisdictions 
management believes that the company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and operations 
everest indemnity  everest national  everest security and mt 
mckinley are subject to regulations similar to the us regulations applicable to everest re 
in addition  everest national and everest security must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct business 
these additional requirements include  but are not limited to  rate and policy form requirements  requirements with regard to licensing  agent appointments  participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures 
these regulations are primarily designed for the protection of policyholders 
licenses 
everest re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and or reinsurer in all states except nevada and wyoming  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
in new hampshire and puerto rico  everest re is licensed for reinsurance only 
such licensing enables us domestic ceding company clients to take credit for uncollateralized reinsurance receivables from everest re in their statutory financial statements 
everest re is licensed as a property and casualty reinsurer in canada 
it is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in singapore 
everest re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries 
because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market for local insurers  everest re is registered as a foreign insurer and or reinsurer in the following countries argentina  bolivia  chile  colombia  ecuador  el salvador  guatemala  honduras  mexico  peru  venezuela and the philippines 
everest national is licensed in states and the district of columbia 
everest indemnity is licensed in delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
everest security is licensed in georgia and alabama 
mt 
mckinley is licensed in delaware and california 
bermuda re and everest international are registered as class insurers in bermuda 
bermuda re is also registered as a long term insurer in bermuda and an authorized reinsurer in the uk periodic examinations 
everest re  everest national  everest indemnity  everest security and mt 
mckinley are subject to periodic financial examination usually every three years of their affairs by the insurance departments of the states in which they are licensed  authorized or accredited 
everest re s  everest security s  everest indemnity s and mt 
mckinley s last examination reports were as of december   while everest national s last examination was as of december  none of these reports contained any material findings or recommendations 
currently  all five companies are under state financial examination for the period ending december  in addition  us insurance companies are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations 
naic risk based capital requirements 
the us national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
the major categories of a company s risk profile are its asset risk  credit risk  and underwriting risk 
the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies  to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments 
under the approved formula  a company s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no action is necessary 
below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurer s domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases 
the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions 
the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated 
based on their financial positions at december   everest re  everest national  everest indemnity and everest security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds 
since mt 
mckinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in  its domiciliary regulator  the delaware insurance commissioner  has exempted mt 
mckinley from complying with rbc requirements 
various proposals to change the rbc formula arise from time to time 
the company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted  the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect  if any  the adoption of any such proposal or change in the rbc calculations would have on the company 
tax matters 
the following summary of the taxation of the company is based on current law 
there can be no assurance that legislative  judicial  or administrative changes will not be enacted that materially affect this summary 
bermuda 
under bermuda law  no income  withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon group and its bermuda subsidiaries 
group and its bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda that  in the event of any taxes being imposed  group and its bermuda subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in bermuda until march non bermuda branches of bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
united states 
group s us subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the us us branches of us subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
should the us subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company would be subject to withholding taxes 
group and its bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the us on this basis  group does not expect that it and its bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay us corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes 
if group or its bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to us income tax  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
united kingdom 
bermuda re s uk branch conducts business in the uk and is subject to taxation in the uk 
bermuda re believes that it has operated and will continue to operate its bermuda operation in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to uk taxation 
if bermuda re s bermuda operations were to become subject to uk income tax there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flow

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information provided in this report  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities 
if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly 
risks relating to our business our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events 
we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events  including weather related and other natural catastrophes  as well as acts of terrorism 
any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations 
we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least million  before corporate level reinsurance and taxes 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  pre tax catastrophe losses  net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs  were as follows calendar year pre tax catastrophe losses dollars in millions our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections 
we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool 
we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area 
these loss projections are approximations  reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes  and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses  net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss 
we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us 
in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities  we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections 
the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate  which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections 
because of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and lae reserves  we cannot be certain that ultimate loss and lae payments will not exceed our estimates 
if our reserves are deficient  we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  the reserve re estimation process resulted in a decrease to our pre tax net income in four of the years calendar year effect on pre tax net income dollars in millions decrease decrease increase decrease decrease see item  business changes in historical reserves  which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years 
the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential a e liabilities 
at year end  roughly of our gross reserves were comprised of a e reserves 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability  which can be difficult to predict  also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for a e liabilities 
the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or result in a net loss 
our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain  we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae 
this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss 
in addition  losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced 
an example of an unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on september  neither the magnitude of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when we priced our coverages 
in addition to unanticipated events  we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures  particularly in long tail liability lines 
an example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena  particularly for a e exposures discussed above 
decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income 
the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  as well as cyclical by product and market 
these cycles  as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products  are outside of our control 
the supply of re insurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry 
demand for re insurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds  including catastrophe losses  and prevailing general economic conditions 
if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for re insurance or an overall increase in re insurance capacity  our net income could decrease 
if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected 
our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by third party rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers 
our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best 
everest re  bermuda re and everest national hold an aa very strong rating from standard poor s 
everest re and bermuda re hold an aa excellent rating from moody s 
financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability 
during the last five years  no active subsidiary of ours has experienced a financial strength rating downgrade 
however  we cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future if we do not continue to meet the evolving criteria expected of our current rating 
in that regard  several of the rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating catastrophic risk relative to their capital and risk management requirements 
therefore  we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our ratings 
consistent with market practice  much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold 
the termination provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below am best s a rating level  which is three levels below everest re s current rating of a 
to a lesser extent  everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade 
that provision would also generally be triggered if everest re s rating fell below am best s a rating level 
the failure of our insureds  intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our net income 
in accordance with industry practice  we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds  agents and brokers and or rely on agents and brokers to process our payments 
we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds  agents and brokers  resulting in a reduction to net income 
we are also subject to the credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss 
if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers  our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience 
we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors  in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business 
we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance 
because we generally purchase reinsurance only when we expect a net benefit  the percentage of business that we reinsure  as indicated below  varies from year to year  depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period 
percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  have thus reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our reinsurance operations 
because we have reduced our level of reinsurance purchases in recent years  our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience 
our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced 
we compete globally in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors 
our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
according to standard poor s  we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups  in which of the market share is concentrated 
the worldwide premium available to the reinsurance market  for both life and non life business  was estimated to be billion in according to data compiled by the international association of insurance supervisors 
the top twenty groups in our industry represent approximately of these revenues 
the leaders in this market are munich re  swiss re  berkshire hathaway  hannover re and syndicates at lloyd s 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future should there be a significant change to the competitive landscape of our market 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
our success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
generally  we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations chairman and chief executive officer  joseph v 
taranto age  president and chief operating officer  thomas j 
gallagher age  and executive vice president and chief financial officer  craig eisenacher age 
of those three officers  we have employment contracts with mr 
taranto and mr 
eisenacher 
mr 
taranto s contract had been previously filed with the sec and was most recently amended on april  to extend mr 
taranto s term of employment from march  until december  mr 
eisenacher s contract had been previously filed with the sec on december  for a term of employment from december  until december  we are not aware that any of the above three officers are planning to leave group or retire in the near future 
we do not maintain any key employee insurance on any of our employees 
special considerations apply to our bermuda operations 
under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after a proper public advertisement  no bermudian  spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda 
currently  all six of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between september and december this includes mark de saram  the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation 
in the event his work permit were not renewed  we could lose his services  thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in bermuda until we were able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit 
the company has an employment contract with mr 
de saram  which was previously filed with the sec and was most recently amended on october  to extend mr 
de saram s term of employment from november  until november  our investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate  credit  and market risks 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments 
both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
for example  the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates 
the market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate 
the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase 
in addition  if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations  investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise 
because all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  temporary changes in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity 
our actively managed equity security portfolio is fair valued and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in our portfolio reduces our capital or could cause us to incur a loss 
we have invested a growing portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities 
the value of these assets fluctuate with changes in the markets 
in times of economic weakness  the fair value of these assets may decline  and may negatively impact net income 
we also invest in non traditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities 
these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships 
the changes in value and investment income loss for these partnerships are more volatile than over the counter securities 
the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities  equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk 
at dollars in millions december  of total mortgage backed securities other asset backed total asset backed other fixed income total fixed income equity securities  at market value equity securities  at fair value other invested assets cash and short term investments total investments and cash we may experience foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels 
through our bermuda and international operations  we conduct business in a variety of foreign non us currencies  principally the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  and the singapore dollar 
assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
our functional currency is the us dollar  and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position 
in  we wrote approximately of our reinsurance coverages in non us currencies  as of december   we maintained approximately of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in non us currencies 
during  and  the impact on our quarterly pre tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of million to a gain of million 
risks relating to regulation insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us  state and foreign insurance laws 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold  prescribe solvency  accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves 
these laws also require disclosure of material inter affiliate transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions 
such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds 
these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies 
the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends  interest and other payments on securities  as applicable  and could restrict our ability to expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries 
we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to date  no material fine  penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation 
current legal and regulatory activities related to the insurance industry  including investigations into contingent commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non traditional products could adversely affect our business and the industry 
the insurance industry has experienced uncertainty and negative publicity as a result of current litigation  investigations  and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental  and enforcement authorities  including the sec  with regard to certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents  the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes  and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional  loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products 
at this time  it appears the effects of these investigations will have more of an impact on specific companies being investigated rather than the industry as a whole  with greater transparency and financial reporting disclosures being required for the entire industry in these areas  however  the future impact  if any  on our operation  net income or financial condition can not be determined at this time 
risks relating to group s securities because of our holding company structure  our ability to pay dividends  interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends  loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries 
group and holdings are holding companies  each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating subsidiaries 
as a result  each of group s and holdings ability to pay dividends  interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it 
this ability is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us  state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions  including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
accordingly  the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to us and holdings in the future  which could prevent us from paying dividends  interest or other payments on our securities 
provisions in group s bye laws could have an anti takeover effect  which could diminish the value of its common shares 
group s bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
for example  group s bye laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti takeover effect election of directors is staggered  meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected each year  shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than of the common shares will be reduced to of the total voting power of the common shares  the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in i any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  ii any person holding controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  or iii any adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to group  any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders  group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder s common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if i any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  ii any person holds controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group  or iii share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to group  any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder 
the board of directors has indicated that it will apply these bye law provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies 
for this purpose  passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible  pursuant to rule d b under the us securities exchange act of  to file a short form statement on schedule g  other than an insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company 
applicable insurance laws may also have an anti takeover effect 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company  a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity and competence of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for changes to the insurance company s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us  the insurance change of control laws of delaware  california and georgia would apply to such a transaction 
this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control 
investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation 
the companies act of bermuda the companies act  differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act  as modified in some instances by provisions of group s bye laws  and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders 
alternate directors 
group s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that each director may appoint an alternate director  who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director 
delaware law does not provide for alternate directors 
committees of the board of directors 
group s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints  and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non directors 
delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees  but those committees may consist only of directors 
interested directors 
bermuda law and group s bye laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity  either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors  then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction 
in addition  after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above  he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest  unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting 
under delaware law  an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit 
additionally  under delaware law  a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled the material facts as to the interested director s relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares  or the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized  approved or ratified 
transactions with significant shareholders 
as a bermuda company  group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders  including asset sales  in which a significant shareholder receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders with prior approval from group s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders 
in the case of an amalgamation  in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company  a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors  except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly owned subsidiaries 
if group was a delaware corporation  any business combination with an interested shareholder which  for this purpose  would include mergers and asset sales of greater than of group s assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least of group s outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder  unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute 
for purposes of the delaware statute  an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that person s affiliates and associates owns  or within the previous three years did own  or more of a corporation s outstanding voting shares 
takeovers 
under bermuda law  if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and  within four months of the offer  the holders of not less than of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares  the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer 
the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer 
the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders 
under another provision of bermuda law  the holders of of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares 
within one month of the court s appraisal  the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders 
if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the court s appraisal price  the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder  who must then refund the purchase price 
there are no comparable provisions under delaware law 
inspection of corporate records 
members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of group available at the office of the registrar of companies and group s registered office  both in bermuda 
these documents include the memorandum of association  which describes group s permitted purposes and powers  any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in group s authorized share capital 
shareholders of group have the additional right to inspect group s bye laws  minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders 
the register of shareholders of group also is open to inspection by shareholders without charge  and to members of the public for a fee 
group is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in bermuda 
group also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us  which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act 
group is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge 
however  bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records 
under delaware law  any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation s shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person s interest as a shareholder 
shareholder s suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of group s memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of group s shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
under delaware law  class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in these types of actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees 
limitation of liability of directors and officers 
group s bye laws provide that group and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that director s or officer s duties 
however  this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty 
this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws 
under delaware law  a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty 
however  these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty  acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  the authorization of unlawful dividends  stock repurchases or stock redemptions  or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit 
moreover  delaware provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws 
indemnification of directors and officers 
group s bye laws provide that group shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done  concurred in or omitted in the conduct of group s business or in the discharge of their duties 
under bermuda law  this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company  as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action  suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense  the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
enforcement of civil liabilities 
group is organized under the laws of bermuda 
some of our directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us a person may not be able to effect service of process within the us on directors and officers of group and those experts who reside outside the us a person also may not be able to recover against them or group on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or group in bermuda courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
dividends 
bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a company  after the payment is made  would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or that the realizable value of a company s assets would be less  as a result of the payment  than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of a company s issued shares  and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value 
under delaware law  subject to any restrictions contained in a company s certificate of incorporation  a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or  if there is no surplus  out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital 
delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
risks relating to taxation if us tax law changes  our net income may be reduced 
in the last few years  some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to low tax jurisdictions 
also  some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions  including bermuda 
although the existing legislation that increases the us tax burden on so called inverting companies does not apply to us  we do not know whether any similar legislation disadvantageous to our bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be enacted into law 
if it were enacted  the us tax burden on our bermuda operations  or on some business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers  could be increased 
this would reduce our net income 
group and or bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax  which would reduce our net income 
bermuda re 
the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations 
we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines  we believe that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully contend that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business in the us  bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs were to successfully contend that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business  we believe that the us bermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda re s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary 
we do not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs were to successfully contend that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us  bermuda re would be subject to us tax on that income 
group 
we conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our us tax exposure 
based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts  if any  of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  we believe that we should be required to pay only immaterial amounts  if any  of us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that we had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  we would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income  and possibly the us branch profits tax and the imposition of such tax would reduce our net income 
if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax  our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax 
in that event  group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations 
the combined effect of the us corporate income tax rate and the branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 
the imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income 
group and or bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax  which would reduce our net income 
group and bermuda re are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in bermuda 
both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares  debentures or other obligations until march  this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to group or bermuda re 
there are currently no procedures for extending these assurances 
as a result  group and bermuda re could be subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which would reduce our net income 
our net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased 
bermuda re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the us in addition  bermuda re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources 
these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda re s business  which would reduce our net income

item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in lawsuits  arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures  the outcomes of which will determine the company s rights and obligations under insurance  reinsurance and other contractual agreements 
in some disputes  the company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it 
in other matters  the company is resisting attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights 
these disputes arise from time to time and as they arise are addressed  and ultimately resolved  through both informal and formal means  including negotiated resolution  arbitration and litigation 
in all such matters  the company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  the company does not believe that any of these matters  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
however  an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in that period
