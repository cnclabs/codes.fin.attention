in the third quarter of  we curtailed our share repurchases following the tightening of credit markets and the continued deterioration in the general economic environment 
we believe that returning to a debt free balance sheet and maintaining the greatest level of flexibility to pursue actions that drive the long term growth of the business are the best use of capital and the most prudent course of action at this time 
as of december   the remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program was million 
there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares 
cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities are expected to be a sufficient source of liquidity for the short and long term and should provide adequate funding for capital expenditures 
in addition  our business model  which can operate with minimal working capital  does not require significant additional capital to fund operations and organic growth 
however  we may elect to seek additional sources of capital to fund growth initiatives  or if a prolonged or more severe economic downturn impacts our ability to meet our financial covenants 
in  we obtained a million bank revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes including the funding of any short term cash needs or investment opportunities

we believe we can improve on execution  and anticipate we will receive the benefits of these programs in the second half of sales assumptions include the anticipated opening of new stores and closing of or more stores 
additionally  the company plans to remodel stores 
sales are projected to benefit from a price increase on select products that took effect in january  higher contributions from international operations  and a rd week 
overall we expect negative sales growth in the first half of  partially offset by positive growth in the second half of the year 
we project our gross margin rate to be flat to slightly lower in as compared to rising commodity costs are projected to be largely offset by our pricing actions  but we anticipate that our product mix could remain weighted towards entry level models until the economy improves
