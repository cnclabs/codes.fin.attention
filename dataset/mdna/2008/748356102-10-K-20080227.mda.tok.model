questar gas has contracted for of firm storage capacity at clay basin for terms extending from five to years and of the firm storage capacity at the aquifer facilities for terms extending for years 
questar pipeline charges ferc approved transportation and storage rates that are based on straight fixed variable rate design 
under this rate design  all fixed costs of providing service including depreciation and return on investment are recovered through the demand charge 
about of questar pipeline costs are fixed and recovered through these demand charges 
questar pipeline s revenues and earnings are driven primarily by demand charges from firm shippers 
since only about of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges  changes in transportation volumes do not have a significant impact on earnings  except when volume changes result from a change in contract demand 
questar pipeline ngl sales decreased in compared to due to lower volumes and lower realized prices due to lower quality liquids removed from the gas stream

clay basin storage in  the company noted a discrepancy between the book volume of cushion gas at clay basin and the volume implied by reservoir pressure test data 
reservoir modeling and pressure tests over the last five years have verified the integrity of the reservoir 
the company believes that an estimated bcf of cushion gas may have been lost in the course of normal operations over the past years 
this loss represents of the volume of gas cycled into and out of the reservoir since storage operations began in during  questar pipeline added to the volume of cushion gas in the clay basin reservoir by purchasing and injecting bcf of gas at a cost of million 
questar pipeline plans to purchase an additional bcf during to replace the remainder of the estimated bcf cushion gas shortfall 
this will restore the volume of cushion gas in the clay basin reservoir to the ferc certificated level

the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remediation costs 
the subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of reserve estimates  other than revisions related to pinedale increased density  resulted in a bcfe increase in questar e p s proved reserves and a bcfe decrease in cost of service proved reserves 
revisions associated with pinedale increased density drilling added bcfe to questar e p s estimated prove d reserves at december   and bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves 
see note for more information on the company s estimated proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
questar form k capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the asset s carrying value 
the asset value is written down to estimated fair value  which is determined using discounted future net cash flows 
accounting for derivative contracts the company uses derivative contracts  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
questar e p uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators 
a liability is recorded to the extent that questar e p has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
energy trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis 
energy trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions  nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices 
questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer bills to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on non gas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
in  the pscu approved a pilot program for a conservation enabling tariff effective january   to promote energy conservation 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers 
the tariff specifies a margin per customer for each month with differences to be deferred and recovered from customers or refunded to customers through periodic rate adjustments 
these adjustments are limited to five percent of non gas revenues 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
employee benefit plans the company has pension and postretirement benefit plans covering a majority of its employees 
the calculation of the company s expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
questar form k independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate estimates of pension and postretirement benefits expense 
the models use key factors such as mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rates of return on investments  rates of compensation increases  amortized gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates 
management makes assumptions based on market indicators and advice from consultants 
the company believes that the liability discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets are critical assumptions 
the assumed liability discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
management considers the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments and compares those results with a bond defeasance technique 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of as of december   and as of december  a increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s qualified pension annual expense by about million 
the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit plan liability
