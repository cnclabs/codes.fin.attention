important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements are set forth below under the heading safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the company suggests that the following discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as presented in item of this report on form k 
introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations  and the critical accounting policies of franklin covey co 
also referred to as the company  we  us  our  and franklincovey  unless otherwise indicated and subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which contain additional information regarding the accounting policies and estimates underlying the company s financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in item of this report on form k 
franklincovey believes that great organizations consist of great people who form great teams that produce great results 
to achieve great results  we seek to improve the effectiveness of organizations and individuals and we are a worldwide leader in providing integrated learning and performance solutions to organizations and individuals that are designed to enhance leadership  strategic execution  productivity  sales force effectiveness  communications  and other skills 
historically  our solutions included products and services that encompassed training and consulting  assessment  and various application tools that were generally available in electronic or paper based formats 
our products and services were available through professional consulting services  public workshops  retail stores  catalogs  and the internet at www 
franklincovey 
com and our best known offerings in the marketplace included the franklincovey planner  and a suite of individual effectiveness and leadership development training products based on the best selling book the habits of highly effective people 
over the past several years  the strategic focus of both our consumer solutions business unit csbu  which was focused primarily on sales of our products  and our organizational solutions business unit osbu  which was focused on the development and delivery of training  consulting  and related services  has changed significantly 
as a consequence of these changes in strategic direction  we determined that the extent of overlap between our training and consulting offerings and our products has diminished 
after significant analysis and deliberation  it became apparent that these business units would be able to operate more effectively as separate companies  each with clear and distinct strategic objectives  market definitions  and competitive products and services 
this conclusion persuaded us to sell substantially all of the operations of the csbu 
during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended august   we completed the sale of the csbu to a newly formed entity  franklin covey products  llc and reported a gain of million from the transaction 
franklin covey products  llc was formed with the objective of expanding the worldwide sales of franklin covey products through proprietary channels and through third party retailers as governed by a comprehensive license agreement with the company 
following the sale of the csbu  we will be able to focus our full resources on the continued expansion of our training  consulting  content rich media  and thought leadership businesses  which currently operate in countries 
our business will primarily consist of training  consulting  and assessment services and products to help organizations and individuals achieve superior results by focusing on and executing on top priorities  building the capability of knowledge workers  and aligning business processes 
our training  consulting  and assessment offerings include services based upon the popular workshop the habits of highly effective people  leadership great leaders great teams great 
table of contents results  the disciplines of executiontm  focus achieving your highest priorities  the habits of a successful marriage  building business acumen  championing diversity  leading at the speed of trust  writing advantage  and presentation advantage 
during fiscal  we introduced a new suite of services designed to help our clients improve their sales through increased customer loyalty 
we also consistently seek to create  develop  and introduce new services and products that will help our clients achieve greatness 
the key factors that influence our operating results include the number of organizations that are active customers  the number of people trained within those organizations  the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients  which is significantly influenced by general economic conditions  and our ability to manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful training and related products to our clients 
the sale of the csbu assets was completed with approximately two months left in our fiscal year ended august   and based upon continuing involvement we will not present the financial results of the csbu in a discontinued operations format 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of the components of the gain and the accounting treatment of the sale of the csbu assets 
since the csbu accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated sales in fiscal  the sale of the csbu had a significant impact on our fiscal financial results and will have an even more pronounced comparative impact on our financial statements in future periods 
our fiscal year ends on august  and unless otherwise indicated  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  refers to the twelve month periods ended august    and results of operations overview of the fiscal year ended august  our fiscal operating results were significantly affected by the fourth quarter sale of our csbu operations  which is described above 
the sale of our csbu operations primarily affected our financial statements through reduced product sales in the fourth quarter  a corresponding reduction in our gross profit  reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses  and the recognition of a million gain 
we used substantially all of the net proceeds from the sale of the csbu to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for million through a modified dutch auction tender offer that was completed close to august  since the tender offer was completed so near the end of our fiscal year  it did not have a significant impact on our weighted average shares outstanding or our calculation of earnings per common share for the year 
for the year ended august   our consolidated sales decreased to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily due to the sale of csbu combined with declining product sales during the fiscal year  which were partially offset by improved training and consulting service sales 
for the year ended august   we reported income from operations of million  including the gain from the sale of csbu  compared to million in fiscal  and our income before taxes decreased to million compared to million in the prior year 
however  with the favorable impact of reduced preferred dividends resulting from the fiscal redemption of the remaining preferred stock  our net income available to common shareholders increased to million compared to million in fiscal the following information is intended to provide an overview of the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  sales performance our consolidated sales decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of csbu and declining product sales that occurred during fiscal our training and consulting services sales increased by million compared to fiscal  which was primarily attributable to improvements in sales through our international delivery channels 

table of contents gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased to million compared to million in fiscal however  our gross margin  which is gross profit stated as a percentage of sales  increased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin was due to increased training and consulting services as a percent of total sales during fiscal since the majority of our training and consulting services have higher gross margins than our product sales 
operating costs our operating costs  excluding the gain on the sale of csbu and the fiscal gain on the manufacturing facility  decreased by million compared to fiscal the decrease in operating costs was attributable to a million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expense  which was primarily due to the sale of csbu  that was partially offset by a million restructuring charge  a million impaired asset charge  and a million increase in depreciation expense 
further details regarding these items can be found in the comparative analysis of fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income before income taxes in our consolidated income statements year ended august  training and consulting services sales product sales total sales training and consulting services cost of sales product cost of sales total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative gain on sale of csbu assets gain on sale of manufacturing facility restructuring costs impairment of assets depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense recovery from legal settlement income before income taxes segment review during the majority of fiscal we had two operating segments the organizational solutions business unit osbu and the consumer solutions business unit csbu 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the csbu  which reduced amounts reported by that segment in fiscal by approximately two monthly reporting periods 
the following 
table of contents is a description of these segments  their primary operating components  and their significant business activities during the periods reported organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of strategic execution  productivity  leadership  sales force performance  and communication training and consulting solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of our domestic sales force  public programs  and certain international operations 
the domestic sales force is responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting solutions services in the united states 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
consumer solutions business unit this business unit was primarily focused on sales to individual customers and small business organizations and included the results of our domestic retail stores  consumer direct operations primarily internet sales and call center  wholesale operations  international product channels in certain countries  and other related distribution channels  including government product sales and domestic printing and publishing sales 
the csbu results of operations also included the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consisted of products such as planners  binders  software  totes  and related accessories  virtually any component of our leadership  productivity  and strategy execution solutions may have been purchased through our csbu channels 
the following table sets forth sales data by category and for our operating segments for the periods indicated

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales training and consulting services we offer a variety of training courses  training related products  and consulting services focused on leadership  productivity  strategy execution  sales force performance  and effective communications that are provided both domestically and internationally through the osbu 
our consolidated training and consulting service sales increased by million compared to the prior year 
training and consulting service sales performance in fiscal was primarily influenced by the following factors in our domestic and international osbu operations domestic our domestic training sales decreased million  or two percent  compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower sales from our sales performance group  public programs  and our book and audio divisions 
decreased sales from these groups were partially offset by increased sales from our combined geographical and vertical market sales offices and by increased sales from specialized seminar events 
during fiscal  sales through our direct sales offices improved over the prior year as acceptance of our core product offerings  which includes the seven habits of highly effective people  leadership great leaders  great teams  great results  and the disciplines of execution  continued to strengthen 
four of our seven domestic offices generated increased year over year sales and sales of our training materials to our client facilitators improved four percent compared to the prior year 
revenue from the number of training and consulting days delivered increased two percent over the prior year as our average revenue per day received increased 
the number of training days delivered  however  declined three percent compared to fiscal international international sales increased million compared to the prior year 
sales from our four remaining directly owned foreign offices as well as from licensee royalty revenues increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year as each of these units achieved double digit growth 
partially offsetting these increases was the elimination of sales from our wholly owned subsidiary in brazil and our training operations located in mexico 
we sold these operations to external licensees during fiscal and we now only receive royalty revenue from their operations based upon gross sales 
the conversion of these operations to licensees had a million unfavorable impact on our international sales but improved our income from these operations compared to the prior year 
the translation of foreign sales to united states dollars had a million favorable impact on our consolidated sales as foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during fiscal product sales consolidated product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  totes  software and related accessories that are primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million compared to the prior year 
the decline in overall product sales during fiscal was primarily due to the sale of our csbu operations in fiscal combined with the following performance in csbu delivery channels prior to the effective date of the sale 
retail stores prior to the sale of the csbu operations  our retail sales decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced traffic in our retail locations  which was partially due to a significant increase in the number of wholesale outlets that sold our products and competed directly against our retail stores  reduced demand for technology and related products  and fewer store locations  which had a million impact on retail sales 
our retail store traffic  or the number of consumers entering our retail locations  declined by approximately percent on a comparable basis for stores which were open during the comparable periods and resulted in decreased sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories 
due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products  during late fiscal we decided to exit the low margin handheld 
table of contents device and related electronics accessories business  which reduced retail sales by million compared to the prior year 
these factors combined to produce a percent decline in year over year comparable store sales versus the prior year 
consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels primarily the internet and call center decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of customers visiting our website and a decline in the number of orders that are being processed through the call center 
visits to our website decreased from the prior year by approximately percent 
declining consumer orders through the call center continues a long term trend and decreased by approximately percent compared to the prior year  which we believe was partially the result of a transition of customers to our other product channels 
wholesale sales through our wholesale channel  which included sales to office superstores and other retail chains  decreased primarily due to the transition of a portion of our wholesale business to a new distributor and the timing of sales as the new distributor built inventories 
csbu international this channel includes the product sales of our directly owned international offices in canada  the united kingdom  mexico  and australia 
product sales were flat through these channels compared to the prior year before the sale of csbu 
other csbu other csbu sales consist primarily of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the decline in other csbu sales was primarily due to decreased external printing sales  which was partially offset by a million increase in sublease revenue 
following completion of the sale of our csbu assets to franklin covey products  we expect that our product sales will decline sharply as the majority of sales reported through the above channels are transitioned to franklin covey products 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold or the cost of services provided 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
we record the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of our consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross profit may not be comparable with the gross profit of other companies that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
for fiscal  our consolidated gross profit decreased to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of csbu and declining product sales during fiscal prior to the sale of csbu 
our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  improved to percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the continuing shift toward increased training and consulting sales  as a percent of total sales  since training and consulting sales generally have higher margins than our product sales 
training and consulting service sales increased to percent of total sales during fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
during fiscal  our training and consulting services gross margin decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the slight decrease was primarily attributable to increased amortization of capitalized curriculum costs during the fiscal year  which was partially offset by increased licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no corresponding cost of sales 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended august   our gross margin on product sales was percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative consolidated sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year excluding the gain on the sale of csbu assets in fiscal and a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility in fiscal 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to the fiscal sale of the csbu  which reduced csbu sg a expenses by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the prior year  a million decrease in share based compensation primarily due to the determination that no shares will be awarded under our fiscal or fiscal long term incentive plans and the corresponding reversal of share based compensation expense from those plans  a million decrease in bonuses and commissions based on sales performance in the osbu during the year  and smaller decreases in sg a spending in various other areas of our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in associate compensation primarily resulting from the payment of awards and bonuses subsequent to the sale of csbu  a million increase in promotional costs in our osbu  which were primarily comprised of increased spending for greatness summit programs for our clients and increased spending on public programs promotional materials  a million increase in legal fees primarily related to the epicrealm litigation  and a million increase in retail store closure costs that were primarily incurred in connection with the buyout of two leases 
following the sale of the csbu  we expect sg a spending to decrease in fiscal compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal gain on sale of csbu assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold substantially all of the assets of our csbu to franklin covey products for million in cash  subject to adjustments for working capital on the closing date of the sale  which was effective july  on the date of the sale closing  the company invested approximately million to purchase a percent voting interest in franklin covey products  made a million priority capital contribution with a percent return  and will have the opportunity to earn contingent license fees if franklin covey products achieves specified performance objectives 
we recognized a gain of million on the sale of the csbu assets and according to specific accounting guidance  we deferred a portion of the gain equal to our investment in franklin covey products 
we will recognize the deferred gain over the life of the long term assets acquired by franklin covey products or when cash is received for payment of the priority contribution 
the gain on the sale of csbu assets also includes a million note receivable for reimbursable transaction costs and excess working capital that is due in january the note receivable bears interest at franklin covey products effective borrowing rate  which was approximately percent at august  restructuring costs following the sale of our csbu  we initiated a restructuring plan that reduces the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralizes certain sales support functions  and significantly changes the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
the restructuring plan is intended to strengthen the remaining domestic sales offices and reduce our overall operating costs 
during fiscal we expensed million for anticipated severance costs necessary to complete the restructuring plan and we expect that the restructuring plan will be substantially completed during fiscal impairment of assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal we analyzed the expected future revenues and corresponding cash flows expected to be generated from our the habits of highly effective people interactive program and concluded that the expected future revenues  less direct costs  were insufficient to cover the carrying value of the capitalized development costs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge to write this program down to its net realizable value 

table of contents depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation expense increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in our depreciation expense in fiscal was primarily due to the acceleration of million of depreciation on a payroll software module that had a revision to its estimated useful life as we decided to outsource our payroll services and an impairment charge totaling million for software that did not function as anticipated and was written off 
depreciation expense in the prior year also included an impairment charge totaling million that we recorded to reduce the carrying value of one of our printing presses to be sold to its anticipated sale price 
based upon the sale of csbu assets and anticipated capital spending in the remainder of fiscal  we expect that total depreciation expense in future periods will decrease compared to fiscal depreciation expense levels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that it was appropriate to reclassify depreciation expense on our subleased corporate campus from cost of sales to depreciation expense 
the depreciation expense reclassified from product cost of sales totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended august    and amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets totaled million for the fiscal years ended august  and absent any unforeseen intangible asset impairments  we expect that intangible asset amortization expense will total million in fiscal following completion of the sale of csbu assets  we anticipate that our consolidated operating expenses in future periods will decline compared to fiscal expense levels 
interest income and expense interest income our interest income decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced cash balances compared to the prior year and a reduction of interest rates on our depository accounts 
interest expense interest expense remained consistent with the prior year and was reflective of borrowings on our line of credit facility and payments made on our building lease financing obligation during fiscal income taxes our income tax provision for the fiscal years ended august  and totaled million 
our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately percent was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program and withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign licensees 
since the company is currently utilizing net operating loss carryforwards  we are unable to reduce our domestic tax liability through the use of foreign tax credits  which normally result from the payment of foreign withholding taxes 
however  the utilization of domestic loss carryforwards has  and will continue to  minimize cash outflows related to domestic income taxes until they are exhausted 
on september   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our income taxes 
preferred stock dividends our preferred stock dividends declined million compared to fiscal the decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales training and consulting services our consolidated training and consulting service sales increased million compared to the prior year and maintained the favorable momentum in training and consulting sales that began in fiscal training and consulting service sales performance during fiscal was primarily influenced by the following results in our osbu divisions domestic our domestic training  consulting  and related sales reported through the osbu continued to show improvement over the prior year and increased by million  or percent 
the improvement was primarily due to the december launch of our new course  leadership great leaders  great teams  great results and increased sales in our individual effectiveness product lines  which contain our signature course based upon principles found in the habits of highly effective people 
our execution product lines  which are primarily based on our disciplines of execution curriculum and our helping clients succeed sales training program also showed year over year improvements and contributed to improved training and consulting service sales 
generally  our training programs and consulting services continued to gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace during fiscal and all five of our geographic regions generated increased year over year sales 
furthermore  the number of training and coaching days delivered increased percent and the average revenue per day received increased six percent 
sales of training materials to our client facilitators also improved over the prior year 
international international sales increased million compared to fiscal sales from our wholly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from third party licensees all grew compared to fiscal the translation of foreign sales to the united states dollar also helped to improve reported sales and had a million favorable impact on our consolidated sales as certain foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during the year ended august  our wholly owned subsidiary in japan generated the largest year over year improvement  and grew its revenues percent  including the effects of foreign exchange  compared to the prior year 
product sales consolidated product sales declined by million  or six percent  compared to fiscal the decline in overall product sales was primarily due to continuing decreases in retail store sales and declining sales through our consumer direct channels when compared to prior periods 
the following is a description of sales performance in our various csbu channels for the year ended august  retail sales the million decline in retail sales was primarily due to the impact of closed stores  reduced sales of technology and specialty products  and decreased store traffic 
based upon various analyses  we closed certain retail store locations in late fiscal and during fiscal  which had a million unfavorable impact on our overall retail sales in fiscal due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products  we decided to exit the low margin handheld device and accessories business  which reduced retail sales by million compared to the prior year 
for the remaining retail stores  the decline in sales was primarily due to reduced traffic  or consumers entering our retail locations 
our retail store traffic declined by approximately percent from fiscal and resulted in decreased sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories compared to the prior year 
these factors combined to produce a six percent decline in year over year comparable store sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal at august   we were operating domestic retail locations compared to locations at august  consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels decreased million  primarily due to a decline in the conversion rate of customers visiting our website  decreased consumer traffic through the call center channel  and decreased public seminar sales 
although visits to our 
table of contents website increased from the prior year  the conversion of those visits to sales decreased to percent in fiscal compared from percent in fiscal we believe that the increase in customer visits and decrease in conversion rate is primarily a function of the increase in promotionally oriented shoppers  or those who visit the website frequently  but only purchase when desired products are on sale 
declining consumer traffic through the call center channel continues a long term trend and decreased by approximately four percent  which we believe was primarily a result of the transition of customers to our website 
wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  were up approximately one percent over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail outlets serviced through our wholesale channel and increased demand for our products in those locations 
csbu international this channel includes the product sales of our directly owned international offices in canada  the united kingdom  mexico  and australia 
sales performance through these channels decreased slightly compared with the prior year 
we separated the product sales operations from the osbu in these international locations during fiscal to utilize existing product sales and marketing expertise in an effort to improve overall product sales performance at these offices 
other csbu sales other csbu sales primarily consist of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the increase in other csbu sales was primarily due to improved external domestic printing sales  which increased million compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to additional printing contracts obtained during fiscal in fiscal  we reported million of sublease revenues as a component of product sales in our consolidated financial statements compared to million in the prior year 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit totaled million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in our gross profit was primarily attributable to increased training and consulting service sales through our osbu 
our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to the continuing shift toward increased training and consulting sales  which generally have higher margins than the majority of our product sales 
training and consulting service sales increased to percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
during fiscal  our training and consulting services gross margin was percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the improvement in training and consulting services gross margin was primarily due to changes in the mix of training programs sold as certain programs and training courses have higher gross margins than other programs 
our gross margin on product sales declined slightly to percent compared to percent in fiscal operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our consolidated sg a expenses increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses consisted primarily of increased associate expenses  increased development costs  increased legal fees  and increased accounting fees 
our associate expenses increased million primarily due to increased commissions and bonuses on improved osbu sales and additional osbu sales personnel  which totaled million  and increased share based compensation costs totaling million  which was primarily attributable to performance awards granted in fiscal we spent an additional million for non capitalized curriculum development to make adjustments and minor improvements to certain programs and courses during fiscal 
table of contents our legal fees increased primarily due to the effects of a non recurring benefit recorded in fiscal from the wma legal settlement and increased legal costs for ongoing litigation that had a net impact on our operating expenses totaling million 
during fiscal  we were required to begin complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  which resulted in million of additional auditing and related consulting fees in fiscal compared with the prior year 
these increases in sg a expense were partially offset by reduced costs in various other areas of the company 
gain on sale of manufacturing facility in august  we initiated a project to reconfigure our printing operations to improve our printing services efficiency  reduce operating costs  and improve our printing services flexibility to potentially increase external printing service sales 
our reconfiguration plan included moving our printing operations a short distance from its existing location to our corporate headquarters campus and the sale of the manufacturing facility and certain printing presses 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility 
the sale price was million and  after deducting customary closing costs  the net proceeds to the company from the sale totaled million in cash 
the carrying value of the manufacturing facility at the date of sale was approximately million and we recognized a million gain on the sale of the manufacturing facility during the year ended august  depreciation and amortization depreciation expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year 
during recent fiscal years our depreciation expense has declined due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment including retail stores and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures 
however  these declines stabilized during fiscal primarily due to increased capital expenditures for property and equipment and an impairment charge totaling million that we recorded during fiscal to reduce the carrying value of one of our printing presses that was sold to its anticipated sale price 
amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets totaled million compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully depreciated during the first two quarters of fiscal interest income and expense interest income our interest income decreased by million primarily due to reduced cash and cash equivalents held during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we used substantially all of our available cash on hand combined with proceeds from a newly acquired line of credit to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
interest expense interest expense increased million compared to the prior year primarily due to line of credit borrowings that were used in conjunction with available cash to redeem the remaining shares of preferred stock in the third quarter of fiscal income taxes our income tax provision for fiscal totaled million compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal the comparability of our fiscal income tax expense was primarily affected by the determination during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
prior to the reversal of these valuation allowances  our income tax provisions were affected by reductions in our deferred income tax valuation allowance as we utilized net operating loss carryforwards 
the fiscal income tax provision was further reduced by the reversal of tax contingency reserves during the third quarter of that year 
no material corresponding reversals of valuation allowance or tax contingency reserves occurred during fiscal our effective tax rate for the year ended august  of approximately percent was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program and withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign licensees 
since the company is 
table of contents currently utilizing net operating loss carryforwards  we are unable to reduce our domestic tax liability through the use of foreign tax credits  which normally result from the payment of foreign withholding taxes 
preferred stock dividends our preferred stock dividends totaled million for fiscal compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to fiscal preferred stock redemptions totaling million and the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the years ended august  and the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
the information presented in the following table includes the reclassification of depreciation expense on our subleased property from cost of sales to depreciation expense as previously discussed 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends

table of contents our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
domestic training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
the fourth quarter of fiscal reflects the sale of csbu assets  which reduced sales and corresponding costs associated with the operations of the csbu 
we recognized a million gain on the sale of the csbu assets  which had a favorable impact on that period s operating results 
in future periods we expect that our quarterly sales will be less seasonal since they will not include product sales that are sold primarily during november  december  and january 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings  the addition of new organizational customers  and the elimination of underperforming offerings 
liquidity and capital resources summary at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased to million at august  compared to million at august  our net working capital at august  was affected by proceeds received from the sale of csbu assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which impacted available cash and other remaining assets and liabilities  and the completion of a modified dutch auction tender offer near the end of the fiscal year that required us to record a million current liability at august  for shares of our common stock acquired through the tender offer 
the obligation for the shares acquired through the tender offer was paid subsequent to august our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of services in the normal course of business and proceeds from our million revolving line of credit 
in connection with the sale of the csbu assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our line of credit agreements with our previous lenders were modified the modified credit agreement 
the modified credit agreement removed one lender from the credit facility  but continues to provide a total of million of borrowing capacity until june   when the borrowing capacity will be reduced to million 
in addition  the interest rate on the credit facility increased from libor plus percent to libor plus percent percent at august   which was effective on the date of the modification agreement 
the fiscal line of credit obligation was classified as a component of current liabilities primarily due to our intention to repay amounts outstanding before the agreement expires 
the modified credit agreement expires on march  no change and we may draw on the credit facilities  repay  and draw again  on a revolving basis  up to the maximum loan amount available so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
we may use the line of credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as for other transactions  unless prohibited by the terms of the modified credit agreement 
the working capital line of credit also contains customary representations and guarantees as well as provisions for repayment and liens 
in addition to customary non financial terms and conditions  our line of credit requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including i a funded debt to earnings ratio  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a limitation on annual capital expenditures  and iv a defined amount of minimum net worth 
in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lenders are entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of 
table of contents amounts outstanding on the line of credit 
during fiscal  we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants of our credit facilities 
at august   we did not have any borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
during fiscal  many banks in the united states and in foreign countries experienced financial and solvency difficulties that lead to significant reductions in the amount of available credit in the general market 
we believe that the lender on our line of credit facility is financially sound and we expect to be able to borrow available amounts on the line of credit 
however  the availability of cash from our line of credit lender is not within our control and additional borrowings may not be available in future periods 
in addition to our million line of credit  we have a long term variable rate mortgage on our canadian building and a long term lease on our corporate campus that is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  cash flows from operating activities our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our cash flows from operating activities were unfavorably affected by cash spent to complete the csbu asset sale and on behalf of franklin covey products  which generated a million receivable that is expected to be substantially collected by january  a million increase in our accounts receivable resulting primarily from seasonally heavy training product sales in august of each year  and a million decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
however  these uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated through a million decrease in other assets and a million decrease in our inventories 
following the sale of the csbu in fiscal  we expect that our seasonal fluctuations in cash used for and provided by operating activities will stabilize since we will not be required to purchase and accumulate inventory for seasonally busy product sales months of november  december  and january 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures our cash flows provided by investing activities were primarily affected by cash received from the sale of csbu assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which totaled million net of transaction costs and cash transferred to franklin covey products 
our primary uses of cash for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment totaling million and expenditures for curriculum development totaling million 
purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of payments for new computer hardware  new computer software  and leasehold improvements in relocated retail stores prior to the sale of csbu assets and for subleases on our corporate campus facility 
we also invested million in franklin covey products to purchase ownership rights and for a million priority contribution 

table of contents during fiscal  we expect to spend million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
purchases of property and equipment are expected to consist primarily of new computer software  computer hardware  and in other areas as deemed necessary 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities our primary use and source of cash flows for financing activities were payments made and proceeds obtained from our million line of credit facility 
primarily as a result of the sale of csbu assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were able to repay amounts outstanding on our line of credit  which totaled million during fiscal in addition to payments on our line of credit  we made principal payments totaling million on our long term debt and financing obligation and received payments totaling million from sales of our common stock  which primarily consisted of proceeds received from participants in our employee stock purchase plan 
as previously mentioned  we completed a tender offer for shares of our common stock near the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded a million current liability for the shares acquired 
we paid for the shares acquired through the tender offer subsequent to august  sources of liquidity going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by the sale of goods and services to our clients on the condition that we can continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from our line of credit  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  purchases of our common stock  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  minimum rent payments for office and warehouse space  mortgage payments on certain buildings and property  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands 
table of contents fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services minimum operating lease payments tender offer obligation long term mortgage payments purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
we are also contractually allowed to collect amounts from franklin covey products that reduce the amounts shown in the table above 
the operating agreement with franklin covey products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which is not included in the lease obligations in the table above 
we completed a tender offer for shares of our common stock near the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded a million current liability for the shares acquired 
we paid for the shares acquired through the tender offer subsequent to august  our long term variable rate mortgage obligation includes interest payments at percent  which was the applicable interest rate at august  our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits under fin of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding the adoption of fin  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 
other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates 
table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
these training programs and services are primarily sold through our osbu channels 
products we sold planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that were primarily sold through our csbu channels prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sales transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when fair value exists for all contracted elements  the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their relative fair values 
revenue for these units is recognized in accordance with our general revenue policies once it has been determined that the delivered items have standalone value to the customer 
if fair value does not exist for all contracted elements  revenue for the delivered items is recognized using the residual method  which generally means that revenue recognition is postponed until the point is reached when the delivered items have standalone value and fair value exists for the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue considered for recognition under our general revenue policies is the total contract amount  less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for our existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of the licensee s sales 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to the company from the licensee 
royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated income statements 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop statement  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of the company s software sales have multiple elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently we do not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of our software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized over the support period 

table of contents revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation during fiscal  we granted performance based compensation awards to certain employees in a board of director approved long term incentive plan the ltip 
these performance based share awards allow each participant the right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based upon the achievement of specified financial goals at the end of a predetermined performance period 
the ltip awards vest on august of the third fiscal year from the grant date  which corresponds to the completion of a three year performance cycle 
for example  the ltip awards granted in fiscal vest on august  the number of shares that are finally awarded to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of a combination of performance objectives related to sales growth and cumulative operating income during the performance period 
due to the variable number of shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluated the ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded for each grant based upon financial results of the company as compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are based upon estimated future performance and are made on a cumulative basis at the date of adjustment based upon the probable number of shares to be awarded 
the compensation committee initially granted awards for  shares the target award of common stock under the ltip during fiscal however  based upon actual financial performance through december  and estimated performance through the remaining service period of the fiscal ltip grant  the company determined that no shares of common stock would be awarded under the terms of the fiscal ltip grant 
we determined that our anticipated sales growth in training and consulting sales would be insufficient to offset forecast product sales declines  which were revised using actual product sales levels late in our first fiscal quarter and early second fiscal quarter  and the impact of eliminated sales resulting from the disposal and conversion of our subsidiary in brazil and our training operations in mexico to licensees 
although we expected sufficient levels of cumulative operating income to be recognized for the fiscal award  anticipated sales growth was below the minimum percent threshold for shares to be awarded under the plan 
as a result of this determination  we recorded a cumulative adjustment in the quarter ended december  that reduced our selling  general  and administrative expenses by million and no compensation expense was recognized from the fiscal ltip award during the quarters ended march   may   or august  the fiscal ltip award expired on august  with no shares granted under this award 
during fiscal  the compensation committee granted performance awards for  shares of common stock under the terms of the ltip 
the company must achieve minimum levels of sales growth and cumulative operating income in order for participants to receive any shares under the fiscal ltip grant 
the minimum sales growth for the fiscal ltip was percent fiscal compared to fiscal and the minimum cumulative operating income total during the service period was million 
we recorded compensation expense on the fiscal ltip using a percent estimated forfeiture rate during the vesting period 
however  the total amount of compensation expense recorded for the fiscal ltip would have equaled the number of shares awarded multiplied by per share 
based upon our assessment of the fiscal ltip at may   we determined that no shares of common stock would be awarded to participants under the terms of the fiscal ltip grant 
consistent with the analysis of the fiscal ltip grant  we expected sufficient levels of operating income to be recognized for the fiscal award  but expected sales growth was determined to be insufficient for any shares to be awarded under this plan 
the revised sales projections included actual performance through may  and estimated sales performance through fiscal based upon revised assumptions  which were adversely affected by slowing economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which the company has operations 
as a result of this determination  we recorded cumulative adjustments totaling million to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses 
table of contents during the fiscal year ended august  we do not expect any shares to vest under the terms of the fiscal ltip award 
the analysis of our ltip plans contained uncertainties because we were required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that would vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and corresponding use of estimated amounts produced additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we recorded cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants as described above 
we estimate the value of our stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
however  the company did not grant any stock options during the fiscal years ended august    or  and we did not have any remaining unrecognized compensation expense associated with unvested stock options at august accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances over days past due  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectibility of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectibility assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would reduce our reported income from operations by approximately million 
inventory valuation at august   following the sale of our csbu  our inventories were comprised primarily of training materials and related accessories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory loss reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory loss reserve calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory reserves methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have a materially adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for instance  a percent increase in our inventory loss reserves at august  would reduce our income from operations by approximately million 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the osbu and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars  international licensee royalties  and related products 
if the carrying value of the covey trade name exceeds the fair value of its discounted estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the adjusted basis becomes the carrying value until a future impairment assessment determines that additional impairment charges are necessary 
our impairment evaluation calculation for the covey trade name contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  to estimate an appropriate royalty rate  and to select a discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows 
our valuation methodology for the covey trade name was developed by an independent valuation firm and has remained materially unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name  our trade name related revenues and licensee royalties would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair the covey trade name 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
although we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology during the past three years  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
on september   we adopted the provisions of fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under the provisions of fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  
table of contents accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and requires increased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
prior to the adoption of fin  interest on income tax items was recorded as a component of consolidated interest expense 
beginning on september   in conjunction with the adoption of fin  interest on income taxes is included as a component of overall income tax expense 
the company records previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  the company considers all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets  considering recent profitability  known trends and events  and expected future transactions 
for several years prior to the year ended august   our history of significant operating losses precluded us from demonstrating that it was more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards would be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
in fiscal we reversed the majority of these valuation allowances 
due to improved operating performance  business models  and expectations regarding future taxable income  the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits of domestic operating loss carryforwards  together with the benefits of other deferred income tax assets will be realized 
thus  we reversed the valuation allowances on certain of our domestic deferred income tax assets  except for million related to foreign tax credits 
however  events and circumstances may change in future periods  requiring us to record valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
these deferred tax valuation allowances could have a material impact upon our reported financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 

table of contents foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expire on a quarterly basis  are recognized currently and are used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated income statements and had the following net impact on the periods indicated in thousands year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net gain loss on foreign exchange contracts at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  approximated the notional amounts of the contracts due to the proximity of the end of the contract to our fiscal year end on august  the notional amounts of our foreign currency sell contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars british pounds japanese yen australian dollars interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily due to our line of credit borrowings and long term mortgage obligation in canada 
at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility  a variable rate line of credit arrangement  and a variable rate long term mortgage on certain of our buildings and property in canada 
the addition of the variable rate line of credit in fiscal increased our interest rate sensitivity and in the future our overall interest rate sensitivity will be influenced by the amounts borrowed on the line of credit and the prevailing interest rates  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent 

table of contents the line of credit had a weighted average interest rate of percent at august  and our variable rate mortgage has interest charged at the canadian prime rate percent at august  and requires payments through january at borrowing levels following the payment of the million tender offer obligation  a one percent increase to the interest rates on our variable rate line of credit and mortgage obligation would increase our interest expense over the next year by approximately million 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
