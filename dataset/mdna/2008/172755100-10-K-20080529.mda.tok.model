overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february through most of our corporate existence  we provided ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
in  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we reinforced our commitment to operate efficiently and profitably by taking strategic actions beginning in to improve our top and bottom line growth  including improving efficiencies by focusing on our product lines including analog mixed signal products and industrial products  divesting ourselves of our digital video product line assets and non core products to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing our capital structure by initiating a million stock repurchase program in fiscal year to increase long term shareholder value 
during fiscal year  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of apex 
apex designs and produces integrated circuits  hybrids and modules used in a wide range of industrial and aerospace applications that require high power precision analog products  such as pwm s and power amplifiers 
these precision amplifiers are used for driving motors  piezo electrics  programmable power supplies and other devices requiring high power and precision control and provide a compliment to our existing industrial product line 
the results of apex s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
we acquired apex for a purchase price of approximately million  consisting primarily of cash and direct acquisition costs 
in fiscal year we took additional steps to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta integrated circuits caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
this action eliminated approximately positions in china during the company s fourth fiscal quarter  and resulted in the company recording a charge of approximately million  which consists primarily of a non cash charge for the assets and goodwill related to caretta  as well as million in cash payments for the affected employees 
also in the fourth quarter  we made a strategic decision to streamline our organization structure in favor of allocating available resources to projects with greater capacity to enhance shareholder value  which resulted in a further headcount reduction of employees 
the restructuring charge associated with this activity amounted to million  and were primarily related to employee severance costs 
see also note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional discussion on these restructuring activities 
finally  on january   we announced that our board authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
as of march  the company had completed the repurchase of million shares at a cumulative cost of million 
the company completed this share repurchase program on april  and purchased a total of million shares  or approximately of the total number of shares outstanding prior to the program  at an average price of per share 
during fiscal year  we realized gross margins of percent for the year 
this represented an increase of percent over the fiscal year gross margin of percent  primarily related to product mix 
in addition  we realized a tax benefit of approximately million that was predominantly related to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets that we expect to utilize within the next fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we settled the outstanding litigation with fujitsu for a net lump sum payment to us of million and enhanced our financial position by obtaining million from a cash receipt associated with an amendment to an existing licensing agreement  in which certain rights to cirrus logic were terminated from a prior cross license agreement 
further  we were able to realize a tax benefit of approximately million due to the expiration of certain statutes related to non us tax liabilities 
we may incur taxes in many of the non us and non us state tax jurisdictions in which we operate

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of net sales 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal years ended march  march  march  net sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs and other  net impairment of non marketable securities acquired in process research and development litigation settlement license agreement amendment income loss from operations interest income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales for fiscal year  we now report revenue in two product categories audio products and industrial products 
certain reclassifications have been made to the and fiscal year presentations to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
this reclassification had no effect on the results of operations or stockholders equity 
during fiscal year we divested ourselves of our digital video product line assets to focus on our core strengths of audio and industrial products 
our revenue by product line is as follows in thousands march  march  march  audio products industrial products total net sales for fiscal year decreased marginally  to million from million in fiscal year the drop in net sales reflects a million decrease in audio products revenues  which was offset by a million increase in industrial products revenues 
within the audio group  revenue decreases in dac  adc  and interface products were partially offset by a million increase in portable products 
the increase within the industrial product group is primarily related to the contributions from apex  which was acquired by the company on july  net sales for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year the drop in net sales is primarily related to the absence of revenues from our digital video product line  a product line we divested in fiscal year this decrease was accentuated by a million decrease in revenues from our mixed signal product line  which is primarily related to a decrease in revenues from legacy products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales from our industrial product line of million 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year export sales to customers located in asia were percent of net sales in fiscal year  percent of net sales in fiscal year  and percent of net sales in fiscal year all other export sales represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
page of 
table of contents our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars

during fiscal year  avnet  inc acquired memec holdings group 
in the past  memec holdings group was our largest distributor 
sales to avnet  inc represented percent  percent  and percent in fiscal years   and  respectively 
no other customers or distributors accounted for percent or more of net sales in fiscal years   or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in a customer s orders could have an adverse affect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year the decrease in margins from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in both customer and product mix 
both audio and industrial product margins experienced slight decreases in fiscal year versus fiscal year the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margins compared to contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which decreased gross margins by percentage points 
gross margin was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the improvement in margins from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in product mix and the absence of the video product line 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margins compared to contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which decreased gross margins by percentage points 
research and development expenses fiscal year research and development expenses increased million from fiscal year depreciation and amortization charges increased million  substantially due to the acquisition of apex on july   and also due to the acquisition of the patents from tripath technologies  inc for million in the first quarter of fiscal year salary and benefit costs increased by million  again largely attributable to the acquisition of apex 
finally  product development expenses increased by million due to higher spending for outsourced firmware  engineering test time  and tape outs 
fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million from fiscal year due to a decrease in expenses associated with the divestiture of the digital video product line 
amortization of intangibles decreased by million from the prior year  million of which was attributable to the absence of amortization on intangibles we sold to magnum semiconductor inc magnum as part of the divestiture 
the divestiture also led to a million decrease in salaries due to lower average headcount  lower vacation expenses  and lower tax expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the fiscal year adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  largely due to a million increase in professional expenses  primarily legal fees attributable to the sec stock option investigation and the silvaco lawsuit 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in fees attributable to our internal stock option investigation expenses incurred in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this is primarily due to a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the fiscal year adoption of sfas r and the recognition of million in loss contingencies on facilities we currently sublease 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees associated with the conclusion of the magnum divestiture and the resolution of certain outstanding legal disputes 
restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal year  we recorded net restructuring charges of million as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption restructuring costs and other  net 
this net charge was comprised primarily of two separate steps taken to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
this action eliminated approximately positions in china during the company s fourth fiscal quarter  and resulted in the company recording a charge which consists primarily of a non page of 
table of contents cash charge for the assets and goodwill related to caretta of million  as well as million in cash payments for the affected employees

see also note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional discussion on these restructuring activities 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of million to operating expenses primarily related to the transition of design activities from our boulder  colorado office to our headquarters in austin  texas 
the restructuring costs for the closure of the boulder design center were composed of million in severance and relocation costs and million in facility related charges 
approximately employees were affected by this action  five of whom relocated to our austin headquarters 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in operating expenses for severance and facility related items associated with workforce reductions related to the sale of the digital video product line assets and changes to sub lease assumptions regarding exited facilities 
this action affected approximately individuals worldwide and resulted in a net charge of approximately million 
in connection with the digital video product line asset sale  we ceased using certain leased office space in our fremont  california location 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the exit from this facility 
partially offsetting the restructuring charge was million related to the gain on the digital video product line asset sale 
for further detail  see note non marketable securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item as of march   we have a remaining restructuring accrual for all of our past restructurings of million  primarily related to future lease payments net of anticipated subleases that will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal year we have classified million of this restructuring accrual as long term 
impairment of non marketable securities during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining cost method investment in magnum  as magnum had received additional capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
based on the results of this analysis as of september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero

the proceeds were recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the heading license agreement amendment 
litigation settlements on april   cirrus logic  fujitsu  ltd 
fujitsu  amkor  sumitomo  and cirrus logic s insurance carriers reached an agreement through an arbitration process to settle and release all pending claims related to the alleged failure of certain semiconductor ics sold by cirrus logic to fujitsu 
these releases included releases between our insurance carriers and us for any claims related to the litigation with fujitsu

the net amount was recorded as a separate line item as a component of operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year realized gain on marketable securities during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold all of our shares in prudential financial inc prudential and realized a gain of million 
we received these shares as we were a policy holder at the time of prudential s demutualization 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million related to the sale of an investment in silicon laboratories  inc silicon labs 
total proceeds from the sale were million 
these shares were received as a result of a prior merger agreement whereby silicon labs acquired cygnal integrated products  inc cygnal 
this merger agreement stated that all shareholders in cygnal  cirrus logic included  would receive shares of stock in silicon labs in exchange for their shares in cygnal 
further  the agreement stated that  should cygnal achieve certain revenue milestones  the former cygnal shareholders would receive a designated amount of stock in silicon labs 
cygnal surpassed certain of those milestones laid out in the merger agreement and  as a result  silicon labs distributed certain shares of its stock held in escrow to cirrus logic in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
cirrus logic sold these shares immediately upon receipt 
interest income interest income in fiscal years   and was million  million  and million respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances on which interest was earned  principally attributable to the cash requirements associated with the company s common stock repurchases occurring in the second half of fiscal year income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
as previously noted  in fiscal year  we incurred a charge to tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
this increase in the valuation allowance was based on an evaluation page of 
table of contents of the net us deferred tax assets we expect to utilize in the upcoming year as a result of projected tax basis net income 
in fiscal year  we released million of the valuation allowance that had been placed on our us deferred tax assets 
this release was based on our history of utilizing deferred tax assets and our expectation to do so again in fiscal year in fiscal year  we provided a valuation allowance equal to our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding whether or not these assets would be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we have deferred tax assets generated in non us jurisdictions that we have recognized since it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent was primarily the result of the realization of deferred tax assets that had been fully reserved and the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that have not yet been utilized 
our effective tax rate also reflected a nonrecurring tax benefit of million that was generated by the reversal of prior year non us tax liabilities due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for the years in which certain potential non us tax liabilities had existed 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent primarily because we benefited from the realization of deferred tax assets that had been fully reserved 
our effective tax rate also reflected a nonrecurring tax benefit of million that was generated by the reversal of prior year non us tax liabilities due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for the years in which certain potential non us tax liabilities had existed 
outlook our outlook for fiscal year reinforces our commitment to drive to consistent operating profitability exclusive of any unusual  non recurring events  such as acquisitions  divestures  or litigation events 
given current indicators  we expect to maintain operating profitability  exclusive of unforeseen events  by achieving revenue growth and continued focus on reducing the cost of our operations 
we remain committed to becoming a consistently profitable company  which better leverages its engineering and intellectual property resources to achieve growth 
we are focused on building a leadership position in our audio  analog and mixed signal product lines 
we believe that the continued worldwide adoption of digital audio products  as replacements for outdated analog components  will provide us continued growth opportunities in our audio business 
our expertise in surround sound audio presents new opportunities beyond the traditional avr market 
in addition  we have numerous products that support digital televisions applications  low power audio applications  and new automotive audio applications 
we have also expanded our opportunities in commercial audio markets and several industrial markets  such as power meters and seismic applications 
overall  we believe that we are well positioned to address the current economic environment  but future revenue  costs  margins  profits and profitability are all influenced by numerous factors  all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 
please refer to item a risk factors of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional information on these factors 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal year  our operating activities generated million in cash 
the positive cash flow from operating activities is predominantly due to the cash components of our net loss as well as a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in other accrued liabilities  and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in accrued salaries and benefits 
in fiscal year  our operating activities generated million in cash 
the positive cash flow from operating activities is predominantly due to the cash components of our net income as well as a million and million decrease in inventories and accounts receivable  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
during fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash during fiscal year was primarily driven by our operations and the receipt of a net million in cash in connection with the fujitsu litigation settlement and a decrease in our inventory of million 
another contributing factor to our increase in cash was a million increase in accounts payable and the receipt of million in connection with certain amendments to an existing license agreement 
these increases to cash were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued salaries and benefits 
in fiscal year  we generated approximately million in cash from investing activities  principally due to the net sale of million in marketable securities  substantially offset by our purchase of apex for approximately page of 
table of contents million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  during fiscal year we invested million and million in technology and property  equipment  and capitalized software  respectively 
in fiscal year  we used approximately million in cash for investing activities 
this was principally due to the net purchase of million in marketable securities and our purchase of caretta for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  during fiscal year we invested million and million in technology and property  equipment  and capitalized software  respectively 
during fiscal year  we used million in cash for investing activities in large part due to the purchase of million worth of available for sale securities partially offset by the sale of available for sale securities of million 
in addition  we purchased million of equipment and technology licenses 
these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of million related to a decrease in the restricted balances required by certain outstanding letters of credit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company utilized approximately million in cash to repurchase and retire portions of its outstanding common stock  as previously discussed in part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
during fiscal years   and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  in cash from financing activities related to the receipt of cash from common stock issuances as a result of the exercises of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
as of march   we had restricted investments of million  which primarily secures certain obligations under our lease agreement for our principal facility located in austin  texas 
this facility is  square feet and houses our headquarters and engineering operations 
the lease agreement for our headquarters and engineering facility includes a letter of credit in the amount of million until november  at which point the requirement decreases to million with the letter of credit ceasing in may although we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to generate cash in the future  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements in our business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as purchase orders  leases and other long term contracts 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of march  payment due by period in thousands years total facilities leases  net equipment leases wafer purchase commitments assembly purchase commitments outside test purchase commitments other purchase commitments total recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations 
sfas revised provides for several changes in the manner in which an entity accounts for business combinations 
it establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities 
sfas revised requires the acquirer to recognize of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities  including goodwill  even if the acquirer has acquired less than of the target 
as a result  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
sfas revised requires that transaction costs be expensed as incurred and are not considered part of the fair value of an acquirer s interest 
under sfas revised  acquired research and development value will no longer be expensed at acquisition  but instead will be capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset  subject to impairment accounting throughout its development stage and then subject to amortization and impairment after development is complete 
sfas revised is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb sfas no 

this statement amends accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  based on our current understanding  we do not expect that adoption will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

 which provides for delayed application of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
based on the company s current operations  it does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
we evaluate the estimates on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we also have policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of sales on sales to our distributors  and our stock option granting practices  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  we perform an analysis of current market data and historical company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility  the expected term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate 
with the exception of the expected forfeiture rate  which is not an input  we use these estimates as variables in the black scholes option pricing model 
depending upon the number of stock options granted  any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated condensed statement of operations 
in addition  any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note stockholders equity of the notes to consolidated financials statements contained in item we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the receivable  our ongoing customer relations  as well as any disputes with the customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we may maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables from customers with whom we are involved in litigation 
see note accounts receivable  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand  management judgment and the age of inventory 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we test for impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of these assets exceeds the fair value of the applicable assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note intangibles  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
our available for sale investments  non marketable securities and other investments are subject to a periodic impairment review pursuant to eitf investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
marketable securities are evaluated for impairment if the decline in fair value below cost basis is significant and or has lasted for an extended period of time 
non marketable securities or other investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
for investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting  we evaluate information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and we weigh all quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
actual values could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

we have provided a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis by determining whether or not the anticipated pre tax income for the upcoming twelve months is expected to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized 
if our future income is not sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized  we increase the valuation allowance to the page of 
table of contents point at which all of the remaining recognized deferred tax assets will be utilized by the anticipated future pre tax income for the next twelve months 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in a simultaneous increase to income tax expense or  in some cases  a decrease in contributed capital 
if our anticipated future pre tax income is sufficient to conclude that additional deferred tax assets should be recognized  we decrease the valuation allowance 
this results in a simultaneous decrease to income tax expense or  possibly  an increase in contributed capital

we use an estimated borrowing rate as the discount rate for all of our restructuring accruals made under sfas no 
our facilities consolidation accruals are based upon our estimates as to the length of time a facility would be vacant  as well as the amount of sublease income we would receive once we sublet the facility  after considering current and projected market conditions 
changes in these estimates could result in an adjustment to our restructuring accruals in a future quarter  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

see note legal matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be made based on the status of the case  the results of the discovery process and other factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities  currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and the affect of market factors on the value of our non marketable equity securities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses at march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
we believe the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates are limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
as with fiscal year  the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates were limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
the increased interest rate risk is based solely on an increase in total cash and marketable securities 
the amounts disclosed in this paragraph are based on a basis point fluctuation in interest rates applied to the average cash balance for that fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in us dollars  however  in fiscal years   and  we entered into minimal transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of our design  technical support and sales offices outside of the us as of march  and march   a ten percent change in the value of the related currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts  we may  from time to time  have changes in exchange rates that can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products and the relative costs of operations based overseas 
page of 
table of contents non marketable securities risk our investments in non marketable securities are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of market prices  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in  their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers or private sales 
these types of investments involve a great deal of risk  and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful  consequently  we could lose all or part of our investment 
as of march   our investments in non marketable securities had a carrying value of million 
this carrying amount approximated fair value as of march  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining cost method investment in magnum  as magnum had participated in another round of capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with eitf based on the results of this analysis as of september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero 
the impairment is recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of non marketable securities 
at march   we had no remaining investments in non marketable securities that have not been fully impaired
