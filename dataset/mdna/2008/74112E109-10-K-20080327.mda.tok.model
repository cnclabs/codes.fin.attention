item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a life sciences company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel  enabling  platform technology called pressure cycling technology pct 
pct uses cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra high levels up to  psi and greater to control bio molecular interactions 
our pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra high levels at controlled temperatures to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio molecules 
our instrument  the barocycler  and our internally developed consumables product line  which includes pulse pressure used to lyse samples for extraction tubes as well as the proteosolve 
lrs 
tm kit for the detergent free extraction of proteins from lipid rich samples  together make up the pct sample preparation system pct sps 
our pressure cycling technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad applications in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas  including  sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies  pathogen inactivation  protein purification  control of chemical enzymatic reactions  and immunodiagnostics 
since we began operations as pressure biosciences in february  we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies 
our business strategy is to commercialize pressure cycling technology in the area of sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies sample preparation 
we also plan to pursue the further development and commercialization of pct in other life sciences applications  which could include working with various strategic partners that have greater scientific  and regulatory  expertise in the respective applications than we do 
to support our current strategy  our primary focus in was the execution of our commercialization plan for pct in sample preparation 
we increased our spending in important areas of our business during  including increased expenses associated with additional staff in the areas of sales and research and development  to support our sales expansion and increased research and development activities 
if we are successful commercializing our technology in the sample preparation market  we believe that our financial results will be positively affected by a combination of the revenue from the sale  lease  and rental of the barocycler instruments  and by the recurring revenue streams that we hope to realize from the sale of the single use pulse tubes  pct dependent kits such as proteosolve 
lrs  and 

extended service contracts on our instrumentation 
we believe the recurring revenue streams that could be generated from our instruments in the field is a very important component of our future financial success 
therefore  we believe that in the short term it is more important for us to focus on increasing the number of installed barocyclers in the field than it is for us to record revenue in the current period 
to this end  we have offered our prospective customers the opportunity to lease or rent the barocycler instruments 
while these arrangements do not provide us with the immediate revenue of a sale  they do serve to expand the utilization of pct and they provide a stream of revenue from the monthly rental income and the sale of consumable products 
we define sales  leases  and rentals of barocycler instruments as revenue generating installations 
we also derive revenues from small business innovation research sbir grants awarded to us by the national institutes of health 
in september  and in march  we received sbir phase i grants in the aggregate amount of  these grants have funded experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of using pressure cycling technology in various applications in the life sciences 
if our work in sbir phase i grants is successful  then we expect to have the opportunity to apply for larger nih sbir phase ii grants 
additionally  if our work with the sbir grants is successful  the publication of application notes in specific areas of research should further support our commercialization efforts 
results of operations years ended december  as compared to revenue we had total revenue of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
revenue from the sale of pct products and services was  in as compared to  in this increase in revenue in was driven primarily by the installation of a total of barocycler instruments during as compared to eight in the prior year 
although the number of instruments that we installed more than doubled in as compared to  the increase in revenue was not as significant 
during  all of the instruments installed were the higher priced nep model while during many of the instruments installed were the lower priced nep model 
additionally  in many of our installations were completed pursuant to lease or rental agreements rather than outright sales 
when we install instrumentation under lease or rental agreements  we record the revenue over the life of the agreement  generally months or months 
we expect the number of units installed will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to commercialize our technology 
we also expect that some portion of future installations will be for the smaller  lower priced  barocycler nep model and some will be placed under lease or short term rental agreements 
therefore  the average revenue per installation may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to drive our installed base and commercialize pct 
during  we recorded  of grant revenue 
this revenue was earned in connection with our research and development efforts performed  under the two sbir phase i grants that we were awarded during and during  we did not record any grant revenue 
cost of pct products and services the cost of pct products and services was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in this decrease in overall cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due to a number of factors 
the first factor was the third quarter sale of four prototype barocycler nep instruments 
these units were prototypes and therefore the costs associated with development and assembly of these instruments were recorded as research and development expense  as such costs were incurred 
the second factor that contributed to an increase in overall gross margin in relative to was a shift in the product mix to include an increasing number of consumables and the sale of several production barocycler nep units  which have a higher gross margin than the nep we believe that our cost of pct products and services will continue to improve as a percentage of revenue as we continue to install more instrumentation  and sell more consumable products  such as pulse tubes and proteosolve 
lrs 
kits 
however  we expect our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to sell  lease  or rent a varying mix of barocycler instrumentation and consumable products 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to  during from  in this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in headcount from an average of three research and development employees during to an average of in consistent with our plans to increase our research and development capabilities  the growth in our staff has allowed us to perform more experiments and provide a higher level of support to our collaboration partners  and to our newly hired sales team 
we believe these efforts are important to the continued development and commercialization of pct 
also contributing to the increase in research and development expense was the approximate  that we incurred in the development of the barocycler nep in addition to developing a new product and a demonstration instrument for our sales force  this expenditure has resulted in the development of the core technology required to create future pneumatic air driven pct instrumentation 
we believe that pneumatic pressure technology will allow us to more easily and rapidly develop the smaller  portable  less expensive instruments that we believe represents an additional significant market opportunity 
research and development expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payment sfas r in and  respectively 
we plan to reduce the level of hiring in  relative to therefore  we expect our spending in this area to increase less significantly than it has in the prior year 
we believe that with our existing staff  we can continue to pursue research and development programs  and continue to invest in our intellectual property portfolio  in the sample preparation area 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to  in from  for the year ended december  in march we announced our plans to begin active commercialization of pct 
as part of this plan  we outlined our intent to build a targeted us based sales force 
during  we completed the hiring of six additional regional directors bringing the total to seven and continued to increase our spending in marketing  and sales support 
additionally  we shifted our technical services department into the sales and marketing function to reflect a shift in departmental responsibilities 
selling and marketing expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in and  respectively 
we expect that selling and marketing expense will continue to increase throughout in support of our commercialization efforts 
we also plan to continue the expansion of our marketing programs and the further development of our foreign distribution network 
general and administrative general and administrative costs totaled  in the year ended december   as compared to  in our general and administrative costs remained relatively flat despite an increase in spending in the areas of investor relations  sarbanes oxley compliance  and legal costs associated with our intellectual property 
these increases were almost entirely offset by a decrease in non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r 
in  our sfas r general and administrative expense was  in  our general and administrative sfas r expense was  the decrease in general and administrative sfas r expense was due to the fact that the outside members of our board of directors did not receive any stock options in the expense related to the stock option grants to outside members of our board of directors during was  we expect general and administrative spending in to be approximately the same as it was in we will continue to incur costs in support of our investor relations programs  sarbanes oxley compliance  and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company  and some continued investment in the development of our infrastructure 
operating loss from continuing operations the operating loss from continuing operations was  in  as compared to  in the year ended december  the  increase relates primarily to an increase in spending in the research and development and selling and marketing areas of our business  in support of our development and commercialization of pct 
included in our operating loss was  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in and  respectively 
we expect our operating loss in to be higher than the operating loss incurred in  due primarily to expected increased spending in our sales and marketing activities and  to a lesser extent  our research and development activities 
we do  however  expect that the gross profit from increasing revenues will mitigate the impact of our increased spending on our overall operating loss 
realized gain of sale on securities held for sale during  we recorded a gain on sale of securities of  in connection with the sale of our remaining  shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock 
in  we realized a gain of  in connection with the sale of  shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock 
as of december   we no longer held any shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock 
interest income interest income totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to interest income of  in the prior year period included approximately  of interest income from our chief executive officer in connection with his loan payable to us 
this note was paid in full in december income tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended december  we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of  despite our history of operating losses  we recorded this benefit due to our expected ability under federal income tax law to carry back current operating losses to offset taxable income that was recorded in during  we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of we do not expect to record any income tax benefit for the foreseeable future due to the fact that we are no longer able to carry back current losses against taxable income from prior periods and because we expect our operating losses to continue for several years 
if we are successful commercializing pct and if we are able to generate operating income  then we may be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards that we generate 
gain on sale of net assets related to discontinued operations during  we realized a gain on the sale of source scientific  llc of  this gain is comprised of the  charge that we recorded in the first quarter of under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab topic e  accounting for divestiture of a subsidiary or other business operation sab topic e and the gain of  net of income taxes of  that we recorded during the second quarter of  the period in which we completed the sale 
we recorded this gain in connection with the receipt on may  of  from mr 
richard w 
henson and mr 
bruce a 
sargeant  the principals of source scientific  llc  as full payment for their purchase of our remaining interest in that business 
during  we accounted for our investment in source scientific  llc under the provisions of sab topic e 
in accordance with sab topic e  we were to record the losses of source scientific  llc  to the extent they exceeded cumulative income for the year 
during  source scientific  llc  was never in a cumulative loss position therefore we did not record any loss in connection with our interest in source scientific  llc 
net loss our net loss in was  as compared to a net loss of  in this decrease in net loss was due to an increase in operating expenses of the business that was more than offset by the gain in the sale of marketable securities and the gain in the sale of assets related to discontinued operations 
without these non recurring items  our net loss in would have exceeded that recorded in we expect that our net loss in will be significantly higher than it was in our expectation of an increase in net loss is based upon plans to increase operating costs relative to in our selling and marketing and  to a lesser extent  our research and development activities 
additionally  our net loss in will not be mitigated by the gain on sale of marketable securities and the gain on sale of assets related to discontinued operations  as was the case in finally  during we do not expect to record a benefit for income taxes as we did in liquidity and financial condition as of december   our working capital position was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  income tax receivable  prepaid expenses and deposits on open purchase orders for the production of barocycler instruments  partially offset by accounts payable  accrued employee compensation  other accrued expenses  and accrued income taxes 
as of december   our working capital position was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  income tax receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  partially offset by accounts payable  accrued employee compensation  other accrued expenses  and accrued income taxes 
the prior year working capital balance excluded the  of investment in marketable securities  and the related deferred tax liability of  that we had classified as current 
this increase in working capital of  is due primarily to the receipt of cash proceeds from the sale of our remaining shares in panacos pharmaceuticals common stock  our receipt of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in source scientific  llc and the sale of  shares of our common stock in november  partially offset by our utilization of working capital to fund our operations 
we expect our working capital position to decline as we fund our operations from our cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations at their current level  and with planned increases in selected areas of our business  into early the extent to which we increase our operational costs is dependent upon our judgment of the investment required to successfully commercialize pct and our ability to secure additional funding through equity or debt financings 
net cash used in continuing operations during was  as compared to net cash used in continuing operations of  during the cash used in operations in included our net loss  an increase in deposits on open purchase orders  inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in income tax receivable and an increase in accrued employee compensation 
we expect net cash used in continuing operations to increase in as we increase our selling and marketing and research and development activities 
net cash provided by investing activities during was  as compared to  in the prior year 
the cash generated in was entirely from the sale of  shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock  partially offset by purchases of fixed assets 
the cash generated in the same period in was entirely from the sale of  shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock  also partially offset by purchases of fixed assets 
we expect that our investment in fixed assets will increase in as we continue to increase our staff and operating facilities 
net cash generated from financing activities during was  and relates to the sale of  shares of our common stock to non affiliated investors pursuant to a private placement that we completed in november net cash used in financing activities in included  to purchase  shares of our common stock from unaffiliated shareholders for an average price of per share  partially offset by proceeds generated by the exercise of options to purchase  shares of our common stock by a director 
the stock purchase from the unaffiliated shareholders was made pursuant to the authorization of our board of directors in september net cash provided by discontinued operations during of  was due to the completion of the divestiture of source scientific  llc 
during the same period in  we received cash from discontinued operations of  this amount was due entirely to the receipt of the final escrow payment in connection with the sale of the boston biomedica core businesses to seracare life sciences  inc critical accounting policies use of estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  deferred tax assets  the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell  and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our current instruments  the barocycler nep and nep  require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set up for initial operation 
to support a favorable first experience for our customers  we send a representative to the customer site to install every barocycler that we sell through our domestic sales force 
the installation process includes uncrating and setting up the instrument and conducting an introductory user training course 
product revenue related to current barocycler instrumentation is recognized upon the installation of our instrumentation at the customer location 
product revenue related to sales of pct products to our foreign distributors is recognized upon shipment through a common carrier 
we provide for the expected costs of warranty upon the recognition of revenue for the sales of our instrumentation 
our sales arrangements do not provide a right of return to our customers 
product revenue related to our consumable products such as pulse tubes and proteosolve 
lrs 
kits is recorded upon shipment through a common carrier 
shipping costs are included in the costs of sales 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we account for our lease agreements under the operating method 
we record revenue over the life of the lease term and we record depreciation expense on a straight line basis over the thirty six month estimated useful life of the barocycler instrument 
the depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included in the cost of pct products and services line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
we pay all maintenance costs associated with the instrument during the term of the leases 
revenue from government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award 
our transactions sometimes involve multiple elements ie  products and services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
we provide certain customers with extended service contracts and  to the extent vsoe is established  these service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract which is generally one to four years 
intangible assets we have classified as intangible assets  costs associated with the fair value of certain assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over sixteen years 
we annually review our intangible assets for impairment 
when impairment is indicated  any excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss 
an impairment analysis of intangible assets as of december  concluded they were not impaired 
long lived assets and deferred costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows related to the long lived assets 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
while our current and historical operating losses and cash flow are indicators of impairment  we performed an impairment analysis at december  and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
recent accounting standards in september  fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a formal framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands on disclosure of fair value measurements 
although sfas no 
applies to and amends the provisions of existing fasb and aicpa pronouncements  it does not  of itself  require any new fair value measurements  nor does it establish valuation standards 
sfas no 
applies to all other accounting pronouncements requiring or permitting fair value measurements  except for  sfas no 
r  share based payment and related pronouncements  the practicability exceptions to fair value determinations allowed by various other authoritative pronouncements  and aicpa statements of position and that deal with software revenue recognition 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date at fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r further changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests see sfas discussion below will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
fas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of non controlling interests minority interests as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to non controlling interests will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within such year  beginning january  early adoption of both sfas r and sfas is prohibited 
we do not expect that either sfas r or sfas will have a material affect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition
