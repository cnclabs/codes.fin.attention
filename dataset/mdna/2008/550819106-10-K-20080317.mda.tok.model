critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill the company accounts for business acquisitions under the purchase method whereby the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents the costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company had goodwill recorded of million at december  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that a future impairment of goodwill will not occur 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the vital fluids business  which is included in the company s filtration separation segment and a reporting unit as defined in fas  had goodwill of million recorded at december  and the vital fluids business reported operating losses in the years through as those years were negatively impacted by a product recall of certain of its blood transfer and storage products 
the recall resulted in lower sales of blood related products  as well as rework  revalidation and other direct and indirect recall related costs during those periods 
the company s annual goodwill impairment testing analysis analysis included projected operating income and positive cash flows for the vital fluids business for the years through based on those projections and other assumptions used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of the vital fluids business exceeded the carrying value of its net assets  and there was no impairment of goodwill at december  during  the vital fluids business exceeded the projected operating income and positive cash flows amounts that were included in the company s analysis 
the operating results were positively impacted by a strengthening in senior management and the sales force  an increased focus on product development  and operational efficiency improvements 
the company s net sales of blood products for the year ended december  exceeded the blood products net sales recorded in and based on projections and other assumptions used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of the vital fluids business exceeded the carrying value of its net assets  and there was no impairment of goodwill at december  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the analysis would not change the company s conclusion 
in addition  the analysis indicated that future operating income results of the vital fluids business would have to be lower by approximately percent  than what was projected in the analysis  for the company to be required to measure the amount of 
table of contents an impairment loss  if any 
the company expects the vital fluids business to achieve these future levels of operating income and positive cash flows  however  if the vital fluids business does not achieve these results in the future there could be a partial or full impairment of its goodwill

pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuary based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
on april   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to certain of the company s domestic defined benefit pension plans  effective june   which provided that benefits under these pension plans will stop accruing for all eligible employees not covered under a collective bargaining agreement 
the amendment did not result in a significant pension curtailment during the second quarter of this amendment significantly reduced pension cost in  as compared to  as the majority of employees are no longer accruing benefits under the domestic defined benefit pension plans 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent will be utilized for determining pension cost  which was also used for in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   the company based its discount rate assumption on a cash flow matching analysis  which matches the future cash outflows of the pension plans to a yield curve comprised of high quality fixed income investments 
benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve and a single discount rate specific to the plans is determined 
prior to  in estimating the discount rate  the company looked to rates of return on high quality  bond indices 
however  these indices gave only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices may not have precisely matched the projected benefit payment stream of the plan 
for this reason  the company also considered the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the company believes the discount rate approach at december   considered a change in estimate  permits a better match of future cash outflows related to benefit payments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for and beyond for these plans will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the 
table of contents deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension income of million as a result of the expected return on assets exceeding the aggregate of i service cost from eligible employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement  ii interest cost and iii amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was percent at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost is expected to be minimal for see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company contributed approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made
