critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
these accounting estimates  critical to understanding our results of operations  are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in addition  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns  and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product 
when evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories 
changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
accordingly  our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal  and tax returns  primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations

see notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our credit facility 
we use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
external investment firms managed  on average  of our invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal within the us  the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds 
outside of the us  our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes 
the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 
as of the end of fiscal  million of the securities now classified as short term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents 
all investments are made according to policies approved by the board of directors 
stock repurchase program i to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
refer to part ii  item in this report for share repurchases during the quarter ended november  as part of this program  on april   the board of directors approved the use of an additional billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the macromedia acquisition 
this additional billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal and  we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of billion and billion  respectively 
we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at periodic intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval  and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
for fiscal  the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by november  are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share 
all outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of november  under this program will expire on or before june  as of november  approximately million of up front payments remained under the agreements 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal subsequent to november   we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of million 
the million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet 
see notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our structured stock repurchase agreements 
stock repurchase program ii in april  we announced that our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program 
under the new program  which is not subject to expiration  we are authorized to repurchase in aggregate up to million shares of our common stock 
this program is in addition to our existing stock repurchase program designed to return value to our shareholders and offset dilution from employee stock programs 
during fiscal  we had provided prepayments of million under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions under this program 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares through structured share repurchase agreements at an average price of and approximately million of up front payments remained under these agreements 
all outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of november  under this program will expire on or before march  as part of this program  in november  the board of directors approved a million share increase commencing in fiscal to this stock repurchase program ii 
this increases the authorization under this program from the original million shares to million shares 
subsequent to november   we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of billion 
the billion will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commitments 
lease commitments two of our lease agreements are subject to standard financial covenants 
as of november   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next months 
we believe these limitations will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of november  total less than year years years over years total non cancellable operating leases total purchase commitments total royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
these liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases 
as of november   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments in countries outside the us  we transact business  in us dollars and in various other currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro and yen are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have foreign exchange option and forward contracts for yen and euro denominated revenue 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen  and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euros  million euros  and million euros  respectively 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to neutralize the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
as of november   total outstanding contracts were million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen  and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of november   all contracts were set to expire at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition  we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of november  and december   this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange option contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange option contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
long term investments long term investments include both equity holdings in publicly traded companies as well as investments in several privately held companies 
we have a policy in place to review our long term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not a security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity  management and ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe the carrying value of our investment is in excess of fair value  it is our policy to write down these long term investments to fair value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of november   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at december  the increase was due to the change in the fair market value of our equity holdings during fiscal see note for information regarding our limited partnership interest in adobe ventures 
the privately held companies in which we invest  can still be considered in the start up or development stages which are inherently risky 
the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of november   that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of  and were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another 
marketable equity securities fixed income investments at november   we had debt securities classified as short term investments of  million 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments 
the table below separates these investments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total  a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the following table represents the potential change in the value of our fixed income securities given an increase in interest rates of various magnitudes 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument
