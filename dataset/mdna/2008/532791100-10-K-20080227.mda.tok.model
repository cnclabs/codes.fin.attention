item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lincare holdings inc and its subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
certain items provided by the company are reimbursed under rental arrangements that generally provide for fixed monthly payments established by fee schedules for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues subject to capped rental arrangements which limit the rental payment periods in some instances and which may result in a transfer of title to the patient at the end of the rental payment period 
once initial delivery of rental equipment is made to the patient  a monthly billing cycle is established based on the initial date of delivery 
the company recognizes rental arrangement revenues ratably over the monthly service period and defers revenue for the portion of the monthly bill which is unearned 
no separate payment is earned from the initial equipment delivery and setup process 
during the rental period  we are responsible for servicing the equipment and providing routine maintenance  if necessary 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  ranging from several weeks to several months  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payor does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense  sales adjustments and related allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to increase our allowances for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amounts received from customers and third party payors and the expected realizable amounts 
actual adjustments that result from such differences are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
business acquisition accounting the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provide guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles for business acquisitions 
we apply the purchase method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets we assess the company s intangible assets for impairment annually  pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
additionally  intangible and long lived assets impairment is tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  without limitation  i significant under performance of acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and vi technological and regulatory changes 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the ability to recover those assets 
if those assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to contingencies 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have concluded that accrued liabilities related to contingencies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations net revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our net revenues by product category year ended december  in thousands oxygen and other respiratory therapy   home medical equipment and other    total    net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of above net revenues for the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth  partially offset by medicare price changes taking effect in see medicare reimbursement 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of above net revenues for the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth partially offset by medicare price changes taking effect in the internal growth in net revenues is attributable to underlying growth in the market for our products estimated at annually and increased market share resulting primarily from our reputation for high quality equipment and customer service 
growth in net revenues from acquisitions is attributable to the effects of acquisitions of local and regional companies and is estimated based on the contribution to net revenues for the four quarters following such acquisitions 
during and  we completed the acquisition of three businesses with annual revenues of approximately million and ten businesses with annual revenues of approximately million  respectively 
the contribution of oxygen and other respiratory therapy products to our net revenues was  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and our strategy is to focus on the provision of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home and to provide home medical equipment and other services where we believe such services will enhance our core respiratory business 
cost of goods and services cost of goods and services as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  cost of goods and services increased by million  or  in and million  or in the increase in cost of goods and services in is attributable primarily to an increase in drug purchasing costs due to a product mix shift away from compounded to higher cost commercially available products in our inhalation drug business as a result of a determination by cms to eliminate medicare coverage of compounded medications as of july  also contributing to higher cost of goods and services in were increased sales of medical supplies and nutritional products to pediatric customers associated with our acquisition of the business of a pediatric respiratory provider in the fourth quarter of we also experienced significant growth in our sleep therapy product lines during  which generally carry a lower gross margin than other products we provide 
the increase in cost of goods and services in is attributable primarily to increased patient and drug shipment volumes and an increase in drug purchasing costs due to a product mix shift in our inhalation drug product line 
cost of goods and services in was also impacted by growth in shipments of disposables and accessories related to our sleep therapy product lines 
cost of goods and services includes the cost of equipment excluding depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively  drugs and supplies sold to patients and certain operating costs related to the company s respiratory drug product line 
these costs include an allocation of customer service  distribution and administrative costs relating to the respiratory drug product line of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

such salary and related expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
operating and other expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
operating expenses in and increased by million  or  and million  or  respectively  when compared with the prior year periods 
gains in productivity at our operating centers and modest growth in office rent and related facility expenses helped to offset higher freight charges due to gains in customer shipment volumes in our inhalation drug and sleep accessory product lines and significant vehicle related cost increases attributable to higher fuel prices and vehicle lease expenses 
the company manages over  operating centers from which customers are provided equipment  supplies and services 
an operating center averages approximately seven to eight employees and is typically comprised of a center manager  two customer service representatives referred to as csr s telephone intake  scheduling  documentation  two or three service representatives referred to as service reps delivery  maintenance and retrieval of equipment and delivery of disposables  a respiratory therapist non reimbursable and discretionary clinical follow up with the customer and communication to the prescribing physician and a sales representative marketing calls to local physicians and other referral sources 
the company includes in operating expenses the costs incurred at the company s operating centers for certain service personnel center manager  csr s and service reps  facilities rent  utilities  communications  property taxes  etc  vehicles vehicle leases  gasoline  repair and maintenance  and general business supplies and miscellaneous expenses 
operating expenses for the years ended december   and within these major categories were as follows operating expenses in thousands year ended december  salary and related    facilities    vehicles    general supplies miscellaneous    total    included in operating expenses during the year ended december  are salary and related expenses for service reps in the amount of million 
such salary and related expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and  were   and  respectively 
sg a expenses in increased by million  or  compared with the prior year period 
contributing to the increase in sg a expenses in were higher payroll costs included in selling expenses and higher liability insurance expenses  partially offset by cost controls at our administrative  field overhead and billing office locations and lower stock based compensation expense 
sg a expenses in increased by million  or  compared with the prior year period 
sg a expenses in were impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
r see notes and to the consolidated financial statements effective january   resulting in the recognition of million of stock based compensation expense during the year 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses in were higher payroll costs included in selling expenses and higher legal expenses  partially offset by cost controls at our administrative  field overhead and billing office locations

included in sg a during the years ended december  and are salary and related expenses of million and million  respectively 
these salary and related expenses include the cost of the company s respiratory therapists in the amount of million and million during the respective years 
bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the years ended december   and days sales outstanding dso were days at december   up from days and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in dso over the three year period is attributable primarily to disruptions caused by the transition in the contractors that process medicare claims during and see medicare reimbursement  an increase in accounts receivable from business acquisitions and growth in our sleep therapy product line  which generally has a higher mix of managed care and commercial insurance payors than our traditional medicare business 
our net accounts receivable balance as of december  was also impacted by the adoption by the company of the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab during the fourth quarter of which resulted in the company recording an allowance for sales adjustments of million see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  business acquisition activities may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in depreciation expense in the year ended december  is depreciation of medical equipment of million and depreciation of other property and equipment of million 
included in depreciation expense in the years ended december  and is depreciation of medical equipment of million and million  respectively  and depreciation of other property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
the growth in depreciation expense in compared with is attributed to increased purchases of medical and other equipment necessary to support the growth in the company s customer base during approximately million and million of the increase in depreciation expense in and  respectively  is attributable to a reduction in the estimated useful lives of certain dme equipment attributable to provisions contained in the deficit reduction act of that change the medicare reimbursement methodology for items of dme in the capped rental payment category see medicare reimbursement 
during  we amortized million of intangible assets compared with million in and million in our net intangible assets were billion as of december  of this total  million consisting of various covenants not to compete is being amortized over periods of one to seven years  as the remainder represents goodwill 
operating income as shown in the table below  operating income for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the prior year 
the increase in operating income in is attributable primarily to revenue growth from increases in customer volumes partially offset by higher costs and expenses as noted above 
the decrease in operating income in is attributable to several factors  including the negative impact on our net revenues resulting from reduced medicare payment rates for inhalation drugs and related dispensing fees that took effect on january  and the reduction of medicare reimbursement rates for oxygen equipment that took effect on april   and higher reported sg a expenses due to the required adoption of sfas no 
r and the resulting recognition of million of stock based compensation expense during the year 
year ended december  in thousands operating income    percentage of net revenues interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense in was higher than interest expense in due to the placement of million of convertible senior debentures in the fourth quarter of and higher average balances outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
interest expense in was lower than the prior year due to the full year effect of the repayment of million of senior secured notes in september of included in interest expense is amortization of debt issuance costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and compared with for the year ended december  acquisitions in  the company acquired certain operating assets of three companies resulting in the addition of one new operating center 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  and million to goodwill 
in  the company acquired certain operating assets of ten companies resulting in the addition of new operating centers 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operating costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service and share repurchases 
at december   our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by million  resulting in negative working capital as compared to positive working capital of million at december  the decline in working capital is primarily attributable to the reclassification of our million principal amount of convertible debentures due the debentures to a current liability due to the right of the holders to put the securities to us for cash within one year of the december  balance sheet 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  we measure our dso by dividing our net accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by the product of our latest quarterly net revenues times four  multiplied by days 
net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  net investment in property and equipment of million  payments of debt of million  proceeds of million from the issuance of debt  proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common shares and million in payments to repurchase our common stock 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million available under our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  dated december   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
as of december   there were million of borrowings and million of standby letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
at december   the company held million of investment grade auction rate securities 
these securities are variable rate debt instruments with contractual maturities between the years and with interest rates that reset every seven or days pursuant to a bidding process as determined by the underlying security indentures 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the book value of available for sale investments held at december   approximated fair value 
therefore  the company had no reported unrealized gains and losses 
the company did not hold any available for sale investments at december  of the auction rate securities held as of december   million are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state designated guaranty agencies or monoline insurers or reinsured by the united states government 
the remaining million was comprised of securities backed by pools of municipal bonds 
all of the auction rate securities held by the company are senior obligations under the applicable indentures authorizing the issuance of such securities 
recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in widespread failures to attract demand for such securities at the periodic auction dates occurring subsequent to december  while all of the auctions involving all of the securities held by the company as of december   were successful during january  auctions involving million of these securities failed to attract sufficient demand in february  resulting in our continuing to hold such securities 
we will continue to monitor credit market conditions to assess the liquidity of our short term investments 
due to our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our revolving credit facility  and our expected operating cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity available to meet our obligations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan whereby the company may repurchase from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  shares of the company s common stock in amounts determined pursuant to a formula the share repurchase formula that takes into account both the ratio of the company s net debt to cash flow and its available cash resources and borrowing availability 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased and retired  shares for million pursuant to the repurchase plan 
on january  and october   our board of directors approved modifications to the share repurchase formula to increase the ratio of debt to cash flow to allow additional share repurchases 
as of december   million of the company s common stock was eligible for repurchase in accordance with the amended formula 
on october   we completed the sale of million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series a the series a debentures and million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series b the series b debentures and together with the series a debentures  the series debentures in a private placement 
the series debentures will pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum 
the series debentures are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will be convertible under specified circumstances based upon a base conversion rate  which  under certain circumstances  will be increased pursuant to a formula that is subject to a maximum conversion rate 
upon conversion  holders of the series debentures will receive cash up to the principal amount  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
the initial base conversion rate for the debentures is shares of common stock per  principal amount of series debentures  equivalent to an initial base conversion price of approximately per share 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  holders of the series a debentures and series b debentures will receive an additional number of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the debentures  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
we will have the right to redeem the series a debentures and the series b debentures at any time after november  and november   respectively 
holders of the series debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their series debentures upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change transactions or on november     and in the case of the series a debentures and november     and in the case of the series b debentures 
on june   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
on june   we sold an additional million principal amount of debentures pursuant to the exercise in full of an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into common stock in any calendar quarter if  among other circumstances  the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price per share per share of our common stock on such last trading day 
interest on the debentures is payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and will mature on june  the debentures are redeemable by us on or after june  and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next months 
accounts receivable the company maintains payor specific price tables in its billing system that reflect the fee schedule amounts statutorily in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which lincare operates  situations can occur where expected payment amounts are not established by fee schedules or contracted rates  and estimates are required to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that revenues and accounts receivable will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
contractual adjustments to revenues and accounts receivable can result from price differences between allowed charges and amounts initially recognized as revenue due to incorrect price tables or subsequently negotiated payment rates 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or account review 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
the company s payor mix is highly concentrated among medicare  medicaid and other government third party payors and contracted private insurance or commercial payors 
government payment rates are determined according to published fee schedules established pursuant to statute  law or other regulatory processes and commercial payment rates are based on contractual line item pricing as reflected in the respective contracts 
fee schedule updates have historically occurred on a prospective basis and have been made available to the company in advance of the effective date of a change in reimbursement rates 
the company s proprietary billing system has features that allow the company to timely update payor price tables within the system as changes occur in order to accurately record revenues and accounts receivable at their expected realizable values 
additional systems and manual controls and processes are used by management to evaluate the accuracy of these recorded amounts 
based on the company s experience  it is unlikely that a change in estimate of unsettled amounts from third party payors would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
accounts receivable balance concentrations by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows percentage of accounts receivable outstanding december  december  medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay total aged accounts receivable balances by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows december  percentage of accounts aged in days over medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay all payors december  percentage of accounts aged in days over medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay all payors the company operates regional billing and collection offices rbcos that are responsible for the billing and collection of accounts receivable 
the rbcos are aligned geographically to support the accounts receivable activity of the operating centers within their assigned territories 
as of december  and  there were  and  full time employees in the rbcos 
accounts receivable collections are performed by designated collectors within each of the rbcos 
the collectors use various reporting tools available within the company s proprietary billing system to identify claims that have been denied or partially paid by the responsible party and claims that have not been processed by the third party payor in a timely manner 
collections of accounts receivable are typically pursued using direct phone contact to determine the reason for non payment and  if necessary  corrected claims are prepared for resubmission and further follow up with the responsible party 
in some cases  third party payors have developed electronic inquiry methods that the company can access to determine the status of individual claims 
the company has benefited from the increasing availability of electronic funds transfers from payors  which now account for approximately of all payments received 
the company believes that its collection procedures contribute to its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and bad debt expense being among the lowest in its industry  according to published industry data and public filings of some of its competitors 
the ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor specific concerns 
the ultimate write off of an accounts receivable occurs once collection procedures are determined to have been exhausted by the collector and after appropriate review of the specific account and approval by supervisory and or management employees within the rbcos 
management and rbco supervisory and management employees also review accounts receivable write off reports  correspondence from payors and individual account information to evaluate and correct processes that might have contributed to an unsuccessful collection effort 
the company does not use an aging threshold for account receivable write offs 
however  the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted  and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write off 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
future minimum obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from repayment obligations for borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and debentures  as well as contractual lease payments for facility  vehicle  and equipment leases and deferred acquisition obligations 
the following table presents  in aggregate  scheduled payments under our contractual obligations in thousands fiscal years thereafter total short term debt   capital lease commitments long term debt     interest expense       operating leases       employment agreements    taxes related interest and penalties total     amounts include the debentures due that are redeemable by us on or after june   and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or the debentures are shown in the table as scheduled for repurchase in as a result of the put feature 
amounts also include the series debentures due the series a debentures are redeemable by us on or after november   and may be put to us for repurchase on november     and the series a debentures are shown in the table as scheduled for repurchase in as a result of the put feature 
the series b debentures are redeemable by us on or after november   and may be put to us for repurchase on november     and the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of million of which we anticipate payment settlement of million during we are unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the payment settlement date or the settlement amount for the remaining balance of million in unrecognized tax benefits
