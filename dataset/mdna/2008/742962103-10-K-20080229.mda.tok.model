item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we implemented our strategic growth plan in the fourth quarter  which resulted in substantial charges in the quarter and a substantial increase in our ongoing operating expenses 
accordingly  when comparing our results of operations for to  the costs incurred in connection with the plan  which affected almost every category of non interest expense  need to be considered 
going forward  we expect our consolidated balance sheet and statement of income to change dramatically as we execute our strategic growth plan 
some of this evolution is already apparent 
our loan portfolio increased million during the fourth quarter of  and we expect to continue to experience strong loan growth for the foreseeable future 
we expect to diversify our loan portfolio over time by increasing the volume of commercial loans we make and thereby creating more balance between our commercial real estate portfolio and our commercial loan portfolio 
we expect to experience a shift in our deposit mix as we develop new client relationships 
we expect to substantially increase transaction accounts and other short term deposit balances from our growing middle market client base 
we also expect to develop relationships with certain institutions who may direct substantial deposits to us 
we are focused on funding our loan growth with core deposits  however as deposit growth lags loan growth  we intend to fund current growth using brokered deposits and other sources of wholesale funding 
we are enhancing our infrastructure to support the growth we expect in our organization and this entails adding additional key personnel  investing in technology and modifying systems as necessary 
we are executing our strategic growth plan in a difficult operating environment for banks  and privatebancorp was not immune to the challenging credit market during non performing asset levels and loan charge offs were higher in than in prior periods  resulting in an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
compared to peer levels  however  our net charge offs to average total loans remained low at for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year period 
we anticipate further adding to our allowance given anticipated strong loan growth in pursuant to our plan 
despite the challenging environment  we have continued to grow our company 

table of contents since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compounded annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compounded annual rate of to billion  deposits at a compounded annual rate of to billion and core deposits at a compounded annual rate of to billion

net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on  interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on  interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of wealth management fee revenue  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains losses and net gains losses on an interest rate swap  if any  are also included in non interest income 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our significant accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the accounting policies that we view as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the estimation of the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets  and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is assessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period  industry loss averages and historical loss 
table of contents experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectable by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to at december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill is pushed down to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using either discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts or  if available  market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses 
no impairment was identified as a result of the testing performed during or note operating segments contains additional information regarding goodwill carrying values 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of lodestar are amortized over an estimated useful life of years 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank michigan are amortized over years using an accelerated method of amortization 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank georgia are amortized over years using an accelerated method of amortization 
income taxes the company is subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states  and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business 
due to the complexity of these laws  taxpayers and the taxing authorities may subject these laws to different interpretations 
management must make conclusions and estimates about the application of these innately intricate laws  related regulations  and case law 
when preparing the company s tax returns  management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws 
taxing authorities have the ability to challenge management s analysis of the tax law or any reinterpretation management makes in its ongoing assessment of facts and the developing case law 
management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate quarterly based on its current estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year 
on a quarterly basis  management also reviews circumstances and developments in tax law affecting the reasonableness of deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for contingent tax liabilities 

table of contents consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income in compared to was substantially due to costs associated with the implementation of our strategic growth plan  as discussed in the section captioned business 
we incurred approximately million in costs in connection with the recruitment of a significant number of experienced middle market commercial bankers 
additionally  we considerably increased our provision for loan losses primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration in the existing loan portfolio 
the increase in net income for compared to was primarily attributable to increases in interest earning assets and growth in fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue 
additionally  the acquisition of the privatebank michigan was accretive in and  including the consideration of all transaction costs 
our income growth was offset by a significant increase in interest expense and non interest expense  evidenced by our efficiency ratio increasing to at december  from at december  net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and amortization of net fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes amortization of loan origination fees and costs recorded from loans

net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings

the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets

during  increased volumes of interest earning assets at lower rates were offset by increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities at higher rates 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year primarily due to a basis point increase in the cost of funds year over year compared to a three basis point increase in yields on earning assets over the same period 
non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by at december  and december  a large portion of our funding is sensitive to movements in the short end of the yield curve  just as a large majority of our loan portfolio is effectively pegged off the prime rate 
our net interest margin remained under pressure during due to the relatively flat yield curve 
during  we also continued to experience pressure on our margin due to decreases in the prime rate of interest and loans repricing more quickly than deposits 
the cost of available funding sources used to support our anticipated loan growth will also impact our margin in  as our reliance on relatively more expensive brokered deposits as a funding source increases  our net interest margin may continue to be compressed 

table of contents additionally  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by the growth of non performing assets during the year  which grew to million at december  from million at december  during the year  the company reversed approximately million in accrued interest income due to loans which became non performing 
the interest reversal during the year accounted for three basis points of margin compression

the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses  which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period  industry loss averages and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 

table of contents we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
management s application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of million at december  compared with million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  reflects management s judgment about the comprehensive risk of lending in our various markets  the addition of new lending personnel as well as strong loan growth from all offices in we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   up from at december  net charge offs totaled million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million for the twelve months ended december   versus million in the prior year period 
the key factors in determining the level of provision is our historical and anticipated charge off rates and an analysis of credit ratings on the loans in our portfolio

under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components allocated inherent component of the reserve the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on loan type and allocated by loan risk within each loan type 
the company assigns each of its loans a risk rating at the time of loan origination and either confirms or changes the risk rating at the time of subsequent reviews  loan renewals or upon default 
the loss allocations are based on a combination of a historical analysis of the company s losses and adjustment factors deemed relevant by management 
the adjustment factors take into account banking industry wide loss statistics  current facts and circumstances  and long term economic trends 
the allocated inherent component of the reserve increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the allocated portion of the reserve reflects higher loan volumes in every category  particularly commercial loans 
specific component of the reserve for loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired  there are specific reserve allocations established 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan pursuant to sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
at december   after taking into account million in net charge offs during the year  the specific component of the reserve increased by million to million from  at december  
table of contents unallocated inherent components of the reserve the unallocated inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the application of loss and loss adjustment factors 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
the unallocated inherent component of the reserve decreased by  for  from million at december  to million at december  in early  we decreased the unallocated component of our reserve due to our judgment that all problem loans had been identified and were specifically reserved for 
as credit quality deteriorated throughout the second  third and fourth quarters  we increased our unallocated reserves to million at december  non performing loans the following table classifies our non performing loans as of the dates shown december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans loans past due days or more and accruing total non performing loans oreo total non performing assets non accrual loans to total loans total non performing loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets it is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which there exists reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal 
non accrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms 
potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we may identify some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include loans with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals

loan concentrations 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   commercial real estate loans and multi family commercial real estate loans comprised of our total loan portfolio of billion 
within this segment  loans secured by vacant land were of the total loan portfolio 
the majority of these loans have a take out commitment  a financially strong guarantor  or both 
commercial real estate typically involves higher loan principal amounts  and the repayment of these loans generally is dependant  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
these loans may be more adversely affected by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy 
commercial loans  including owner occupied commercial real estate  of billion comprise of our total loan portfolio 
these loans are to a diverse group of businesses and are mostly secured and or guaranteed

market and interest rate risk market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  or equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities and changes in relationships between rate indices 
the asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the guidelines established by alco are reviewed by the investment committee of the company s board of directors 
the company did not have any material equity price risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk at december  
table of contents we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have used derivatives in past years as a risk management tool and may use such instruments in the future  however we currently do not have any such instruments in our balance sheet 
changes in market rates give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies

our net interest margin decreased to during  as compared to at december  during and  our costs on wholesale funds  short term borrowings and deposits outpaced the increase in earning asset yields due to the shape of the yield curve

the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to issue brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required

liquidity risk management the objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that the company can meet its cash flow requirements and capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events 
liquidity is secured by managing the mix of items on the balance sheet and expanding potential sources of liquidity 
we manage liquidity at two levels at the holding company level and at the bank subsidiary level 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the holding company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources 
liquidity management is guided by policies formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding  the level of unfunded commitments and potential future loan growth 

table of contents we also develop and maintain contingency funding plans  which evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
the plans are reviewed and approved annually by the asset liability committee 
our bank subsidiaries principal sources of funds are client deposits  wholesale market based borrowings and capital contributions by the company 
the bank subsidiaries also anticipate the availability of large institutional deposits as a key funding source in our bank subsidiaries principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends received from its bank subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior  subordinated and convertible debt  as well as equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt  share repurchases  dividends paid to stockholders  interest paid to our debt holders and subsidiary funding through capital and or debt 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity for our bank subsidiaries 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits  compared to at december  core deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined to include all deposits  including time deposits  but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as a funding source  we continue to utilize wholesale funding sources  including brokered deposits  in order to enhance liquidity and to fund our loan growth 
in  we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits as an alternative method of funding growth 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect our threshold limitation to encumber our ability to implement our growth plan 
over the past three years  we have reduced our reliance on brokered deposits given strong growth rates in core deposits 
due to our expected accelerated loan growth  and the usual lag between funding that loan growth and capturing core deposits  we expect our brokered deposit to total deposit levels to increase beyond the levels reflected in the last several years 
brokered deposits declined to of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral

cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  each of the banks may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
at december   our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings was million  of which we had million outstanding 
our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings is not a committed line of credit  and is dependent upon lender availability 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under our million credit facility with lasalle bank 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 

table of contents impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our investment committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
one way to estimate the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is a gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred

at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to a decline measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to a decline measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a and basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
the table presented above reflects that the company is incrementally less interest rate sensitive to falling rates and more interest rate sensitive to rising rates at december  as compared to december  the primary factor contributing to the company becoming slightly less asset sensitive in  is the shorter duration of the company s borrowed funds at december  as compared to december   offset by the magnitude of floating rate loans booked 
there are several factors contributing to the shortening in the duration of borrowed funds  including our decision to increase the level of our federal funds purchased 
we also continued to draw on our credit facilities during these lines charge interest based upon floating rate indices  further shortening our funding duration 
as the absolute level of short term rates has dropped during  more of our loans are approaching or hitting their floors  which has the result of moderating further rate sensitivity in falling rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
