item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the provision of dna testing services that generate genetic profile information by analyzing an organism s unique genetic identity 
we focus our business on dna testing primarily for human identity and  to a lesser extent  agricultural applications 
in the human identity area  we principally provide dna testing services for forensic  family relationship and  to a lesser extent  security applications 
forensic dna testing is primarily used to confirm that a suspect committed a particular crime  to exonerate an innocent person or to establish or maintain databases of individuals convicted of crimes or  in some instances  arrested in connection with crimes 
family relationship dna testing is used to establish whether two or more people are genetically related 
dna testing is used by individuals and employers in security applications to establish or store a person s genetic profile for identification purposes in the event of an emergency or accident 
in agricultural applications  we provide dna testing services for food safety and selective trait breeding 
we have operations in the united states  or us  and in the united kingdom  or uk  and the majority of our current customers are based in these two countries 
our forensic  family relationship and security dna testing services are conducted in both the us and the uk  while all of our agricultural dna testing services are conducted in the uk 
based on our review of publicly available information regarding contract sizes and competitor activity  supplemented by industry publications and third party market assessment data  we believe that the us and uk are two of the largest existing markets for dna testing services today 
in the us and uk  a significant amount of our current testing activity is under established non exclusive contracts with government agencies 
these contracts are usually awarded through a sealed bid process and  when awarded  typically have a term from one to three years 
we believe that our experience and reputation as a reliable provider of services to government agencies is a valued credential that can be used in securing both new contracts and renewing existing contracts 
in connection with our strategy to expand our business organically as well as through acquisitions  on october   we acquired the common stock of reliagene technologies  inc  or reliagene  a provider of forensic and paternity dna testing services based in new orleans  louisiana 
the acquisition was made pursuant to a stock purchase and sale agreement with the shareholders of reliagene 
the aggregate purchase price was million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
the purchase price was adjusted downward by thousand based on reliagene s working capital at closing 
such amount was delivered to us out of an escrow account in january the purchase price is further subject to adjustment based on reliagene s future revenue levels and all of the common stock issued for the acquisition was placed in escrow for the revenue adjustment and to satisfy the sellers indemnification obligations 
there is no significant customer overlap between us and reliagene and we believe the combined forensic and paternity laboratory testing volumes should increase our operational efficiencies 
our operations in the us accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have implemented measures to improve our us financial 
table of contents results through a strategy designed to obtain new contracts with average sales prices that allow us to cover our variable and overhead costs and improve our gross margin 
during  we have been able to increase our average selling price per sample in our us forensic contracted casework and database testing services  as compared to  however  we continue to experience significant price competition in both our forensic database and paternity testing businesses 
in addition  we are focused on improving our operational execution to increase throughput in our laboratories and lower aggregate operating costs 
in particular  in our forensics business we have reduced our sample processing time and decreased the number of samples that need to be retested 
our focus on improved pricing and operational excellence has improved our gross margins and significantly reduced the amount of cash used in our operations 
our operations in the uk accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our uk revenues and  and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived through our agreement with forensic alliance ltd  or fal 
fal is a company providing a range of forensic testing services to a number of police forces in the uk  including certain forensic dna testing services previously carried out by us on a subcontract basis 
in  fal was acquired by lgc ltd  or lgc  a provider of analytical and diagnostic services and one of our competitors in providing dna testing services in the uk 
our agreement with fal was terminated effective july  and we then entered into a series of temporary extension agreements with lgc  the latest of which expires april  although we have been continuing to provide services through these temporary extension agreements  we expect lgc to provide directly  commencing over the next two months  substantially all of the dna testing services to two key police forces in the uk and a portion of the dna testing services for a third key police force that we presently service 
we expect to provide some dna services to the police forces that we served under our fal arrangement through pilot work 
we continue to focus  however  on providing our services directly to uk police forces and we have been successful in winning competitive bids on several forensic contracts to provide such direct services to different uk police forces 
in february  our uk facility was awarded a significant portion of the north west south west and wales regional tender in the uk 
under the terms of the award  we will provide testing services for database crime scene  forensic casework and pace samples for several police forces that tendered their work 
this award followed a lengthy competitive bidding process 
work under this award is expected to commence in the second quarter of after completion of contracts with each of the police forces 
we believe that the actions we have taken to date have placed us in a position to successfully transition from our prior relationship with fal to directly providing these services to police forces in the uk 
in addition  we expect approximately police forces in the uk to tender their work through the uk s national procurement plan  a formalized bidding process to be implemented this year 
we are currently planning our strategy for submitting bids through this plan and expect the police forces to tender their work in the month period following implementation of the plan 
we believe that the actions we have taken to date have placed us in a position to successfully transition from our prior relationship with fal to directly providing these services to police forces in the uk 
operating highlights our revenues are predominately generated from dna testing services provided to our customers 
our costs and expenses include costs of service revenues  research and development expenses  marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization expense and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  depreciation and facility expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our services 
marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for marketing and sales personnel within our organization and all related costs of selling and marketing our services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  insurance and other corporate expenses 

table of contents our operating results improved for the year ended december  as compared to overall  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   total revenues increased approximately and gross margin  as percentage of service revenues  increased to approximately from approximately 
the increase in revenues and gross margin was primarily a result of increased revenues in our uk and us forensics testing services and the impact of the acquisition of reliagene during the year ended december  as compared to the increase in revenues and gross margin was partially offset by lower revenues in our uk agricultural testing services and our government and private paternity testing services in the us  as well as increased laboratory personnel costs 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses  other than cost of service revenues  declined by approximately as compared to  primarily due to decreased general and administrative  marketing and sales and restructuring expenses  due to our focus on cost containment 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and change change in thousands total revenues cost of service revenues research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring expense benefit amortization of intangible assets total other income  net income tax expense net loss revenues total revenues for the year ended december  of million represented an increase of approximately million  or approximately  as compared to revenues of million for our us service revenues for the year ended december  of million increased by million  or approximately  as compared to million for  primarily due to increased volume in our us forensic testing services and the impact of the acquisition of reliagene 
this increase was slightly offset by declines in volume for our government and private paternity testing services 
revenues from our uk based testing services increased by million  or approximately  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for our uk based revenues increased due to increased volume and pricing in forensics testing services  particularly major crime  non violent crime and uk pace database testing services 
the non violent crime testing services and pace database testing services increased primarily due to new contracts we were awarded in to provide services directly to several different uk police forces 
the increase in forensic testing services revenues was partially offset by decreased agriculture revenues as a result of lower volume 
agriculture revenues decreased primarily due to a decision made by the department for environment  food and rural affairs  or defra  to limit scrapie testing to male sheep  and to a lesser extent  to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease which prevented the collection of tens of thousands of samples 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk revenues were also favorably impacted by approximately  as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 

table of contents under the terms of our agreement with defra  which extends through december  we are the exclusive supplier of genotyping services offered to sheep farmers under the uk government s national scrapie plan  or nsp  which is designed to help british farmers breed sheep with reduced genetic susceptibility to the disease 
although we are the exclusive supplier of genotyping services under the nsp  we expect our future revenues under our contract with defra to be lower than those achieved during comparable periods in and  due to defra s decision to limit testing to male sheep 
we performed forensic testing services for several police forces throughout the uk through our subcontractor agreement with fal 
revenues derived through the fal agreement accounted for approximately and of our total revenues and approximately and of our uk revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  fal was acquired by lgc  a provider of analytical and diagnostic services and one of our competitors in providing dna testing services in the uk 
our agreement with fal was terminated effective july  and we then entered into a series of temporary extension agreements with lgc  the latest of which expires april  although we have been continuing to provide services through these temporary extension agreements  we expect lgc to provide directly  commencing over the next two months  substantially all of the dna testing services directly to two key police forces in the uk and a portion of the dna testing services for a third key police force that we presently service 
we expect to provide some dna services to the police forces that we served under our fal arrangement through pilot work

cost of service revenues cost of service revenues was million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of service revenues primarily reflects increased laboratory personnel costs  partially offset by decreased depreciation expense 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk cost of service revenues increased by approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
the increase in gross margin percentage from in to in is a result of improved pricing in us forensic casework and codis testing services and improvements in operating efficiencies  partially offset by reduced gross margin contribution associated with the reduced uk agricultural testing services 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  and were million  a decrease of thousand as compared to million during the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to reduced personnel costs 

table of contents marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of thousand as compared to million during the prior year

this decline was slightly offset by increased volume for our us forensic testing services 
revenues from our uk based testing services declined by million  or approximately  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for specifically  our uk based testing services declined due to reduced volume and pricing in non violent crime testing services and reduced volume in agriculture testing services  with such declines partially offset by increased revenues from government paternity testing due to increased volume and pricing 
for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  our uk revenues were favorably impacted by approximately  as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
during the year ended december   we recognized thousand in other revenues  specifically license revenues  as compared to million for the decline in other revenues is principally due to lower royalties received on our microfluidic technology patents during the year ended december  our microfluidic technology patents do not relate to our business of dna testing services 
effective september

as of december   we had thousand in short term debt obligations and thousand in long term debt obligations  of which thousand was classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity have been issuances of our securities and other capital raising activities 

table of contents the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in thousands change change cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared with net cash used in operations of approximately million for the prior year 
the change in operating cash flows was mainly a result of a decreased net loss  improved collections of our accounts receivable and a decrease in paying down our accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended december  as compared to investing activities during the year ended december  primarily consisted of million spent to acquire reliagene and million of capital expenditures  as compared to million in capital expenditures  partially offset by the release of thousand of restricted cash for the prior year

november private placement on november   we completed a common stock private placement to certain new and existing institutional investors which raised million in gross proceeds million in net proceeds after direct transaction costs 
we sold approximately  shares of common stock at per share in the private placement 
we filed a registration statement on form s covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the private placement  which was originally declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  on december  we have since filed a post effective amendment to this registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on april  restricted cash as of december   cash restricted for one of our operating leases and a government contract  in the amount of thousand  is reflected as a non current asset in the consolidated balance sheet 
expected uses of liquidity in throughout  we plan to continue making investments in our business 
we expect the following to be significant uses of liquidity cost of service revenues  salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  
table of contents fees for the collection of samples  facility expenses  marketing expenses  general and administrative costs and the costs associated with the integration of reliagene into our business 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
in addition  we may make additional investments in future acquisitions of businesses or technologies which would increase our capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
however  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
we also may need additional capital if we seek to acquire other businesses or technologies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we maintained multiple contractual commitments as of december  which will support our future business operations 
such commitments relate to noncancelable operating lease arrangements  debt obligations and a lease guarantee 
we have identified and quantified the most significant of these commitments in the following table 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations debt obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations such amounts represent future minimum rental commitments for office space and equipment leased under noncancelable operating lease arrangements 
such amounts represent amounts payable under our line of credit and various notes payable 
such amounts represent an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned in connection with the sale of our former diagnostics business unit 
we were required to sign this guarantee as a condition of the sale 
we reflected the fair value of the guarantee at the time of the sale of the diagnostics business of approximately million as a reduction to the net realizable value of these assets and liabilities 
we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy of the space for ten months prior to subleasing the space and expected rental income from the sublease of the space 
the lease terminates in april minimum remaining rents under the assigned lease total approximately million 
limitation on the use of our nol carryforwards as of december   our nol carryforwards were million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
some of the federal and state nol carryforwards we have generated or acquired have begun to expire 
utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the tax reform act of  or the act 
the 
table of contents act provides for a limitation on the annual use of nol carryforwards and research and development credits following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act  which could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards and research and development credits 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by the act  occurred in and as a result million of our nol carryforwards is limited 
we may have experienced other ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings and may experience others in connection with future financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned federal nol carryforwards may be further limited in the future 
if our nol carryforwards are limited or expire  we would not be able to offset future earnings with these nol carryforwards which could negatively impact our liquidity in the future 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition stock based compensation valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill income taxes revenue recognition we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we have applied the modified prospective method of adoption  under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
under the modified prospective method  fas r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of december  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  includes expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and expense for all share based payments granted during the year ended december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
stock based compensation is classified within cost of service revenues  research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations 
stock options granted to employees  which are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  in general vest in four years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 
stock options granted to our board of directors in general vest in three years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 

table of contents we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately not vest and the expected dividend yield 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock price  over the expected term of the option 
our stock options are considered plain vanilla options based on the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 share based payment  or sab  and as such we have elected to use the simplified method  whereby we have assumed that all options will be exercised midway between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option to determine the expected term of the option 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
 share based payment  or sab  to amend the sec s views discussed in sab regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with fas r 
sab is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab  as amended by sab we have not paid dividends since our inception  nor do we expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  thus the expected dividend yield assumption is zero 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in the market value of the assets 
the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the long lived assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on projected discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimate using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
income taxes 
we have generated nol carryforwards for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these nol carryforwards have resulted in nol carryforwards of million and million for federal and state 
table of contents income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  certain charges recorded in the current and prior years were not currently deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of nol carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then record income taxes on our us operations at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
as of january  and december   the unrecognized tax benefits amounted to approximately thousand  including an immaterial amount for accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
the tax years remain open to examination by the uk taxing authorities and the tax years remain open to examination by the us taxing authorities 
in addition  the us taxing authorities may examine the tax years from our inception in through  but are barred from adjusting our tax liabilities in excess of the net operating losses generated in any of those tax years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements  or fas fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
fas does not expand or require any new fair value measures  however  the application of this statement may change current practice 
the requirements of fas are first effective for our fiscal year beginning january  however  in february  the fasb decided that an entity need not apply this standard to non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until the subsequent year 
accordingly  our adoption of this standard on january  is limited to financial assets and liabilities 
we do not believe the initial adoption of fas will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  we are still in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on non financial assets and liabilities and therefore have not yet determined the impact that it will have on our consolidated financial statements upon full adoption 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or fas fas provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
an entity that adopts fas will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
we will be required to adopt fas for our fiscal year beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations  or fas r  which replaces fas no 
 business combinations 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  or fas fas states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
this statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
fas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
we will be required to adopt fas for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of fas on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents while management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward looking statements  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially  including the risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k and the cautionary information set forth under the heading risk factors appearing in item a of this annual report on form k 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
as of december   we had thousand in fixed rate long term notes payable and thousand in a variable rate short term line of credit 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the variable debt interest rates and assuming we held thousand in variable debt during the entire year ended december  and currently estimate that such a change would not have a material impact on our loss before income taxes for the year ended december  foreign currency risk our business derives a substantial portion of its revenues from international operations 
we record the majority of our foreign operational transactions  including all cash inflows and outflows  in the local currency  british pound 
we record all of our us operational transactions  including cash inflows and outflows  in us dollars 
we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and while there is currently no material adverse impact to our financial results  future material adverse exchange rate movements would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations have a material economic impact on us  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the british pound to us dollar currency exchange rate and currently estimate that such a change would have impacted loss before income taxes for the year ended december  by approximately thousand
