many of our competitors have longer operating histories  better name 
table of contents recognition and greater financial resources than we do  which may enable them to implement their business strategies more readily than we can

risk factors described below and throughout this annual report are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate 
there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known 
there are also risks related to the economy  the industry and the capital markets that affect business generally  and us as well  which have not been described 
if any of the described events occur  our business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected 
our failure to timely file our exchange act reports with the sec could jeopardize our listing on the nasdaq global select market  could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and could lead to a drop in the price of our common stock if our shares are suspended from trading or delisted 
due to the investigation of the special litigation committee  which is described in greater detail in item under the heading legal proceedings in this annual report  we were unable to timely file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the form k and our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march  the first quarter form q 
although we plan to make every effort to file our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended june  the second quarter form q by the sec s filing extension deadline of august   we may not be able to do so because  to date  our attention has been focused on completing and filing the form k and the first quarter form q 
if we are unable to file the second quarter form q by the sec s filing deadline  the nasdaq listing department will likely notify us pursuant to rule a of the nasdaq manual the manual that we have failed to comply with rule b a of the manual and that our shares would be delisted 
we plan to request a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel and make a request for a conditional listing on the nasdaq global select market until we are able to file the second quarter form q

the trading suspension or delisting of our shares would likely reduce the liquidity of our common stock and could lead to a drop in the market price of our common stock 
our failure to timely prepare and file our exchange act reports with the sec could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility 
failure to timely file our exchange act reports with the sec constitutes an event of default under our existing credit facility entered into in february with wells fargo bank  na  as administrative agent the credit facility 
as a result of the delay in filing our form k and first quarter form q  we entered into two amendments and waivers of default to our credit facility in march and june of these agreements i extended the time period for filing our form k  first quarter form q and second quarter form q with the sec and the delivery of our financial information to the lenders and ii granted us waivers of the event of default triggered by the delay in our sec filings 
the most recent amendment to the credit facility  which was entered into on june   extended the deadlines by which we must file the form k and the first quarter form q to august   and the second quarter form q to august  the filing deadlines set forth in the amendment to the credit facility are later than the sec s filing deadlines for these exchange act reports 
in the event we are unable to file our exchange act reports with the sec and furnish the lenders with all of the financial information required under the amended credit facility by the new deadlines  the lenders under the credit facility could  among other things  agree to a further extension of the deadlines for the exchange act reports  exercise their right to accelerate the payment of all amounts then outstanding under the credit facility  enforce the security interests they hold in our assets or pursue further modifications with respect to the credit facility 
we can make no assurances that there will be any future extensions of the time period for filing our exchange act reports with the sec or furnishing required financial information to the lenders or that there will be a further waiver of the related event of default 

table of contents we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and expect to incur substantial additional costs to address these control deficiencies and in connection with our ongoing efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to include a report with each annual report on form k regarding the company s internal control over financial reporting 
as discussed in item a  controls and procedures of this annual report  our management has conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and has identified several material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
a detailed description of the material weaknesses is provided in item a  controls and procedures of this annual report 
due to these material weaknesses  management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  we have engaged in  and continue to engage in  substantial time and efforts to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and expect to continue to engage in substantial time and efforts to address the control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we have taken or plan to take will ensure that we design  implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or will be sufficient to address and eliminate these material weaknesses 
our inability to remedy these identified material weaknesses or any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future  could  among other things  cause us to fail to file our exchange act reports with the sec in a timely manner  prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial information and forecasts or from avoiding or detecting fraud  or require us to incur further additional costs or divert management resources 
the special litigation committee s investigation  the sec s informal investigation and the pending derivative litigation have resulted in significant fees  costs and expenses  diverted management time and resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred significant professional fees  expenses and other costs in connection with the special litigation committee s investigation  responding to and cooperating with the sec s informal investigation  and in defending against the derivative litigation  each of which is described in item  legal proceedings of this annual report 
as of june   the company has incurred million in expenses related to these matters including advancement of legal fees to individuals pursuant to our indemnification obligations 
these expenses include million in and million for the six months ended june  in addition  our board of directors  management and employees have expended a substantial amount of time in connection with these matters  diverting resources and attention that would otherwise have been directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy 
we expect to continue to spend additional time and incur additional professional fees  expenses and other costs in responding to and cooperating with the sec s informal investigation and in defending against the derivative litigation 
in addition  if the sec were to conclude that an enforcement action is appropriate as a result of its investigation or if we are not able to successfully defend against  or arrive at a satisfactory settlement agreement with respect to  the derivative litigation  we may divert even greater amounts of time from our management  board of directors and employees  and incur even greater fees  expenses and costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
under delaware law  our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements between us and certain of our current and former directors and officers  we have an obligation to advance legal expenses and may have an obligation to indemnify our current and former directors and officers with respect to the informal sec investigation and the derivative litigation 
these indemnifiable obligations may not be reimbursable under our directors and officers liability insurance 

table of contents we have purchased directors and officers liability insurance 
our directors and officers liability insurance covers events for which payment obligations and the timing of payments are only determined in the future 
the insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us for insured claims 
under our directors and officers liability insurance policy  we are responsible for the cost of claims up to a self insured limit 
in addition  we cannot be sure that claims will not arise that are in excess of the limits of our insurance or that are not covered by the terms of our insurance policy 
due to these coverage limitations  we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business would be harmed if we do not continue successfully to implement our internet strategy 
we use the internet as our primary vehicle to provide sales leads and database information to our customers 
the internet is widely accepted by businesses worldwide and is a very powerful distribution channel for information 
our salesgenie  salesgenie lite and other products are now being offered on the internet on a subscription basis 
we have adopted an internet strategy because we believe that the internet represents an important and rapidly evolving market for marketing information products and services 
our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to develop products and services that are well suited to the internet market  experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and services  or fail to achieve sufficient traffic to our internet sites to generate significant revenues  or successfully to implement electronic commerce operations 
our markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
the business and consumer marketing information industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
our competitors include acxiom  experian  harte hanks communications  inc  dun bradstreet  and other companies in research 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants to the business and consumer marketing information industry as a result of the rapid expansion of the internet  which creates a substantial new channel for distributing business information to the market 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  better name recognition and greater financial resources than we do  which may enable them to implement their business strategies more readily than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
changes in the direct marketing industry and in the industries in which our customers operate may adversely affect our business 
many large companies are reducing their use of direct mail advertising and increasing their use of on line advertising  including e mail  search words  and banner advertisements 
as a result of this change in the direct marketing industry  such customers are purchasing less data for direct mail applications 
in addition  several of our customers operate in industries  in particular the financial and telecommunications industries  that are undergoing consolidation 
such consolidation reduces the number of companies in those industries  and therefore may reduce the number of customers we serve 
we are addressing these changes by offering products that integrate our data  data processing  database marketing and e mail resources  and pursuing industries that are experiencing growth rather than consolidation 
we cannot guarantee that the marketplace will accept these new products  or that we will be successful in entering new markets 
if we do not gain acceptance for our new products or successfully enter new markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents we are highly dependent on key personnel 
we are highly dependent on senior members of our management team 
loss of our key personnel would likely impede achievement of our research and development  operational  or strategic objectives 
to be successful  we must retain key employees and attract additional qualified employees 
we are leveraged 
if we are unable to service our debt as it becomes due  our business would be harmed 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately million 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the terms of our existing credit facility 
our ability to pay principal and interest on the indebtedness under the credit facility and our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance 
our performance will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
certain of these factors are beyond our control 
the future availability of revolving credit under the credit facility will depend on  among other things  our ability to meet certain specified financial ratios and maintenance tests 
we expect that our operating cash flow should be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  to make necessary capital expenditures and to service our debt requirements as they become due 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  however  we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying acquisitions and or capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness including the credit facility or seeking additional equity capital 
we may not be able to implement any such measures or obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable or satisfactory to us  if at all 
furthermore  as described above  the covenants in the credit facility require us to be current on our sec filings and deliver certain financial statements to the lenders 
if are unable to do so  there is no assurance that we can amend the credit facility to avoid having to meet this requirement or receive a waiver from lenders  and the credit facility may become immediately due and payable 
fluctuations in our operating results may result in decreases in the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis 
our expense levels are relatively fixed and are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenues 
as a result  unexpected changes in revenue levels may have a disproportionate effect on operating performance in any given period 
in some period or periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
our failure to meet analyst or investor expectations could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
if we do not adapt our products and services to respond to changes in technology  they could become obsolete 
we provide marketing information and services to our customers in a variety of formats  including printed formats  magnetic media  dvd  and electronic media via the internet 
advances in information technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and product delivery formats 
if we do not successfully adapt our products and services to take advantage of changes in technology and customer preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services  and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services  our revenues may decline 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products and services 
products and services that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development 
we cannot be assured that the marketplace will accept these products 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services  our ability to increase revenues will be impaired 

table of contents changes in laws and regulations relating to data privacy could adversely affect our business 
we engage in direct marketing  as do many of our customers 
certain data and services provided by us are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states as well as those in canada and the united kingdom 
in addition  growing concerns about individual privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals have led to self regulation of such practices by the direct marketing industry through guidelines suggested by the direct marketing association and to increased federal and state regulation 
there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy concerns  particularly as it relates to the internet 
this concern is likely to result in new laws and regulations 
for example  in the federal trade commission amended its rules to establish a national do not call registry that permits consumers to protect themselves from unsolicited telemarketing telephone calls 
various states also have established similar do not call lists 
and although do not call list regulations do not currently apply to market research phone calls  such as the type performed by us  new legislation or regulation could eliminate the current market research exemption 
compliance with existing federal  state and local laws and regulations and industry self regulation has not to date seriously affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the collection  management or commercial use of such information may increasingly affect our operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
our business would be harmed if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions 
our business strategy includes continued growth through acquisitions of complementary products  technologies or businesses 
we have made over acquisitions since and completed the integration of these acquisitions into our existing business 
we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and intend to pursue opportunities that we believe fit our business strategy 
acquisitions of companies  products or technologies may result in the diversion of management s time and attention from day to day operations of our business and may entail numerous other risks  including difficulties in assimilating and integrating acquired operations  databases  products  corporate cultures and personnel  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  difficulties in applying our internal controls to acquired businesses  and particular problems  liabilities or contingencies related to the businesses being acquired 
to the extent our efforts to integrate future acquisitions fail  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
future acquisitions may also harm our operating results  dilute our stockholders equity and create other financial difficulties for us 
we may in the future pursue acquisitions that we believe could provide us with new technologies  products or service offerings  or enable us to obtain other competitive advantages 
acquisitions by us may involve some or all of the following financial risks use of significant amounts of cash  potential dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and future impairment charges related to diminished fair value of businesses acquired as compared to the price we pay for them 
we may not be successful in overcoming the risks described above or any other problems associated with future acquisitions 
any of these risks and problems could materially harm our business  prospects and financial condition 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that any companies we may acquire will achieve anticipated revenues or operating results 

table of contents a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our products and services is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our databases 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our products and services 
we also license proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the business partners to whom we grant non exclusive licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources  which could significantly impede our ability to operate our business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  resulting in decreased revenue  operating income and earnings per share 
our international operations subject us to additional risks and challenges that could harm our business and our profitability 
we have begun expanding internationally  and plan to expand in high growth  emerging international markets 
international operations subject us to additional risks and challenges  including the need to develop new customer relationships  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in and differences between domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  price controls  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  lower per capita internet usage and lack of appropriate infrastructure to support widespread internet usage  political and economic instability  foreign currency fluctuations  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts in foreign countries 
some of these factors may cause our international costs to exceed our domestic costs of doing business 
failure to adequately address these risks could decrease our profitability and operating results 

table of contents our contracts with the us federal government grant the government rights that are typically not found in commercial contracts and that could adversely affect our revenues and income 
as a result of our acquisition of orc in  we have approximately active contracts and task orders with the us federal government 
there are inherent risks in contracting with the us federal government which could have an adverse effect on our business 
all contracts with the us federal government contain provisions  and or are subject to laws and regulations  that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in our commercial contracts  including rights that allow the government to claim rights in and ownership of products and systems that we produce  adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits completed by its agencies  suspend or debar us from doing business with the us federal government  and release information obtained from us in response to a freedom of information act request 
government contractors are often subject to enhanced scrutiny with respect to corporate governance and other measures of business conduct 
matters arising from the derivative litigation and the informal sec investigation may adversely effect the company s reputation in this regard  which in turn could jeopardize our government contracting business 
the us federal government has the right to terminate its contracts with us at any time and such terminations could adversely affect our revenues and income 
the us federal government has the right to terminate its contracts with us at any time 
if the us federal government terminates a contract  we may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on work completed before the termination 
if the government terminates a contract for default  we may not recover even those amounts  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
additionally  most of our backlog could be reduced by any modification or termination of contracts that we have with the us federal government or  in cases where we are a subcontractor  contracts that our prime contractors have with the us federal government 
as a contractor to the us federal government  we are subject to restrictions and compliance requirements that could divert the attention of our management  drain our resources and or result in additional costs  fines or other penalties 
as a contractor to the us federal government  we are subject to various laws and regulations that are more restrictive than those applicable to non government contractors 
we are required to obtain and maintain material governmental authorizations and approvals to conduct our business as it is currently conducted 
new or more stringent laws or governmental regulations concerning government contracts could hurt our business by limiting our flexibility and by potentially causing us to incur additional expenses 
we also must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of us federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our us federal government clients and may result in added costs for our business 
for example  we are required to comply with the federal acquisition regulations and all supplements  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of us federal government contracts  and the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 

table of contents any of the sanctions could adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  or operating results 
our government contracts are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the us federal government  which could hurt our operating results 
our government contracts are subject to audits and reviews by the us federal government of our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
responding to governmental audits  inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert the attention of our management 
an audit of our work  including an audit of work performed by companies we have acquired or may acquire  could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues because any costs determined by the government to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and revenues we have already recognized may need to be refunded 
if a us federal government audit results in allegations of improper or illegal activities by us or our employees and if we are unable to successfully defend against those allegations  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension  and or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us regardless of the merits of any such allegation 
in addition  the us federal government may conduct non audit reviews on a majority of our government contracts  which in turn could lead to full audit reviews by the government

general overview in  we reorganized our segments both for operational and reporting purposes 
in  we reported results in three segments the data group  the services group  and the marketing research group 
we believe that by organizing all of our businesses that sell proprietary content into a single segment  we are more effectively deploying sales and marketing resources 
we also believe that the reorganization creates better opportunities for cross selling proprietary databases under one brand name 
the fiscal years and financial information contained in this annual report has been revised to reflect the new segments 
our initiatives for fiscal year included continuing to migrate one time use customers to subscription based plans for our internet based services 
we believe that a key to this effort is replacing revenue from declining traditional direct marketing products and services with revenue from our on line internet subscription services 
we believe that subscription services offer enhanced annual revenue per customer  assure greater multi year revenue retention  and  most importantly  provide greater value to our customers by providing internet access to our content and customer acquisition and retention software tools 
continuing to capture more information from the websites of businesses  such as description  executive names  titles and hours of operation 
expanding international business and executive databases by adding content for china and australia 
expanding the presence of yesmail  our e mail technology company 
increasing investments in merchandising  advertising and branding 
the advertising campaigns include e mail  print  television  radio  direct mail  and search word advertising  as well as the use of white glove client services 
most notable advertisements included three commercials that aired during the super bowl  on february   featuring salesgenie 
com 
continuing the integration efforts related to opinion research corporation  acquired in december  by facilitating a strategic cross selling plan 
developing a call center for the marketing research group based in papillion  nebraska that we believe will significantly reduce its cost of services

we frequently evaluate the strategic opportunities available and intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary products  technologies or businesses that we believe fit our business strategy 
in connection with future acquisitions  we expect that we will be required to incur additional acquisition related charges to operations 
associated with the acquisitions previously described  we recorded amortization expense on other purchased intangibles as summarized in the following table amounts in thousands fiscal year amount 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be the most critical because they are the most important to our portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and they require subjective or complex management judgments revenue recognition and related estimates of valuation allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and other allowances  database acquisition  development and maintenance expenses  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of prospect lists paper form or electronic  mailing labels  published directories  other sales lead products  and dvd information products are recognized upon shipment 
these product sales are typically evidenced by a written purchase order or by credit card authorization 
list management revenue is recognized net of costs upon shipment of a list to a third party 
list brokerage revenue is recognized net of costs upon verification from the third party of the actual list used and shipped 
data processing and e mail customer retention solution revenues are billed on a time and materials basis  with the recognition of revenue occurring as the services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
revenues from the licensing of our data to third parties and the sale of our subscription based products are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  when we commit to provide the customer either continuous data access ie  access via the internet or updates of data files over a period of time 
licenses and subscriptions are evidenced by written contracts 
we also license data to customers with no such commitments 
in those cases  we recognize revenue when the data is shipped to the customer  provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
services performed in the marketing research group vary from contract to contract and are not uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement 
revenues under fixed price contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis 
performance is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance  including survey design  data collection  survey analysis and presentation of deliverables to the client 
progress on a contract is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
provision for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
customers are obligated to pay as services are performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
revenues under cost reimbursement contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
applicable estimated profits are included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
incentives  award fees or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenues and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
invoices to clients are generated in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract  which may not be directly related to the performance of services 
unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract including deliverables  timetables and incurrence of certain costs 
unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenses are included in revenues with corresponding costs incurred by us included in cost of revenues 
we assess collectibility of revenues and our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record our trade accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to the 
table of contents delivery of our products  we recognize revenue upon the receipt of cash 
cash basis revenue recognition periodically occurs in those cases where we sell or license our information products to a poorly capitalized company  such as an internet startup company 
however  sales recognized on this basis are not a significant portion of our total revenues 
database costs 
our database and production costs are generally charged to expense as incurred and relate principally to maintaining  verifying and updating our databases  fulfilling customer orders and the production of dvd titles 
costs to develop new databases are capitalized and amortized upon the successful completion of the databases  over a period ranging from one to five years 
our cost of maintaining consumer and business databases does not necessarily vary directly with revenues since a significant portion of the cost is the maintenance and verification of our existing data 
consequently  operating income may vary significantly with changes in revenue from period to period  as our ability to adjust certain elements of our cost structure is limited in the short run 
because we expense the costs of maintaining and verifying our existing database  our balance sheet does not include an asset for the value of our database 
we believe that our databases of consumer and business information are valuable intellectual property assets 
our success in marketing our products and services depends  in large part  on our ability to maintain an accurate and reliable database of business and consumer information 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  included the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure impairment based on estimated fair value of the assets 
net property and equipment  net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  we completed an impairment test as of october  and  respectively  and determined that no impairment existed 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step is essentially a purchase price allocation exercise  which allocates the newly determined fair value of the reporting unit to the assets 
for purposes of the allocation  the fair values of all assets  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  are determined 
the residual goodwill value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the impairment charge 
at december   we had three reporting units that had goodwill and therefore required testing pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the three reporting units represent a subset of the operating segments reported upon in the accompanying financial statements 
we used the gordon growth model to calculate residual values 
the gordon growth model refers to the concept of taking the residual year cash flow and determining the value of a growing  perpetual annuity 
the long term growth rate used for each reporting unit was 
we used weighted average costs of capital ranging from to in our discounted cash flows analysis 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but would not be limited to  the likelihood we would 
table of contents realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pretax income could impact our overall effective tax rate 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income along with prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period any such determination was made 
likewise  in the event we were able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period any such determination was made
