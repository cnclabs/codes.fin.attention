in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
a watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the special assets manager and the senior credit officers  reviews all loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and this meeting is observed by the loan review manager and summarized for the credit management committee on a monthly basis 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses quarterly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the watch loan committee of the bank to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 
the loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed quarterly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines

it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend a change the borrower s risk grade accordingly 
currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type see discussion below 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information 
the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the bank s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures

the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed 
table of contents less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market area  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
the function of determining the allowance for credit losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank 
the following table presents an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses

all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
there is an increased reserve percentage for each successively higher risk grade 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
following the merger  the bank elected to adjust the reserve percentage for certain risk grades  based on its analysis of the history of the combined loan portfolio and the associated chargeoffs  as well as current economic conditions 
based on these revisions  approximately million was added to the allowance for credit losses 
the bank had of its total commercial loans in risk grades that are deemed acceptable or better at year end  compared to at year end mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
retail loans 
the retail loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of retail loans to determine the required reserve for current loans and loans past due less than days 
a separate reserve is calculated for loans past due days or more 
a reserve amount equal to of all retail loans past due days or more is added to the above mentioned requirement to determine the total reserve requirement for retail loans 

table of contents specific impairment under sfas no 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in loans considered impaired was approximately million and million  respectively 
impaired loans at december  consisted of million of retail loans past due days or more  or classified as non accrual  million of commercial and real estate loans graded substandard  and million graded doubtful 
impaired loans at december  consisted of million of retail loans past due days or more  or classified as non accrual  million of commercial and real estate loans graded substandard  and million graded doubtful 
the increase in the amount of impaired loans held by the bank resulted primarily from a reevaluation of the credit quality of the portfolio  considering current economic conditions and continuing efforts to resolve the quality issues identified through the combined efforts of internal and external loan reviews 
watch list review 
specific allowances may be determined based on a review of specific watch list loans 
specific losses are estimated at each measurement date 
the bank has established a watch list committee to review all loans placed on the watch list 
the watch list primarily consists of loans classified as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
an action plan is established for each watch list loan 
by reviewing these watch list loans  the bank is able to update original probable loss amounts in light of developing conditions 
this serves to reduce the differences between estimated and actual observed losses 
during  the bank continued to focus on reviewing its loan portfolio and reclassifying its loans  as required 
watch list loans increased to million at year end  from million at year end the reserve requirement for watch list loans totaled million and million for and  respectively 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses totaled million  compared to million in as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  primarily comprised of million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned 
those figures compare to million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned at the end of  totaling million in nonperforming assets 
net charge offs increased in to million  or of average loans outstanding  compared with million  or of average loans outstanding in the prior year 
at december  and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of year end loans was and  respectively 
the results have been impacted by ongoing evaluations of our credit portfolio  prompted by the current volatile economic situation

loans are placed on nonaccrual status when i management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan principal and interest and ii generally when such loans are days or more past due 
no assurance can be given  however  that economic conditions will not adversely affect borrowers and result in increased credit losses

effects of inflation inflation affects financial institutions in ways that are different from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on net interest margins as a major source of earnings 
noninterest expense  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment cost  are also negatively affected by inflation 
application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry  and are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the bank s allowance for credit losses  one of the most complex and judgmental accounting policies of the company 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed quarterly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary  if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used 
see additional discussion under asset quality above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s president  chief financial officer cfo  cco  investment officer  chief risk officer and other senior executives 
the committee meets on a regular basis to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the risk committee of the bank s board of directors 

table of contents a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming twelve month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  yet have no stated maturity 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
based upon the bank s historical experience  this analysis assumes of now accounts  of savings accounts  and of mmi accounts will reprice within one year  and the remaining balances will reprice after one year 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio has a variable rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 

table of contents in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the bank also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  net interest income analysis  and present value of equity analysis  under various rate shock scenarios 
the bank uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income of the bank 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and calculates the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  management believes that this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming month period 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the bank is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
the company considers the bank s interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk  which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the bank is asset sensitive based on the results of its simulation model  as well as actual experience  which means that falling interest rates could result in a reduced amount of net interest income 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk
