the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item of this report 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
fishing 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal and oil purchased from other suppliers 
on august   the company s moss point  mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
on september   the company s cameron  louisiana and abbeville  louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by hurricane rita 
each of these facilities was non operational immediately after these weather events 
operations at the moss point fish processing facility  the abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re established in mid october   but at reduced processing capabilities 
these two facilities were returned to full operational status prior to the beginning of the gulf fishing season in april operations at the cameron fish processing facility were re established in june  but at reduced processing capabilities 
the cameron facility became fully operational in september the direct impact of the two hurricanes upon the company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at the company s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 

index to financial statements harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
the company s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which the company has no control 
for example  the oil yield results were the poorest in recent company history 
for illustrative purposes  the company s oil yields for the fishing season were lower by compared to those in the fishing season and were lower by compared to the company s year oil yield average 
the causes of lower fish oil yields are believed to relate to fish diet  weather and water temperature but are not generally well understood 
the impact of these poor oil yields have resulted in significantly higher per unit inventory costs and fewer volumes available for future sale 
these higher unit costs and fewer volumes available for sale have adversely impacted financial results for the fourth quarter of and first and second quarter of there was no material impact in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  in late  the company s gulf coast facilities were rendered inoperable due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
two of the three facilities regained operational status prior to the end of the fishing season and the other facility did not regain its operational status until the season 
these hurricane damages adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
markets 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  the company has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products have increased approximately 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependant upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  the company developed a business plan to expand its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish 
index to financial statements meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during  and again in  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions 
the company supplemented its inventories and subsequent sales by purchasing other fish meal and oil products 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
the company purchased products totaling approximately   and  tons  or approximately  and of total volume sales for the fiscal year ended december   and  respectively 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for due to increasing demand for these products 
during  and approximately  and respectively  of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and month to month 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal
