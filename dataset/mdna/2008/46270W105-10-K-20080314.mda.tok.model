item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units in two business segments as determined in accordance with sfas our in vitro diagnostics  or ivd  segment also called iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis and body fluids 
with the acquisition of leucadia technologies we created our iris molecular diagnostics  or imd  subsidiary in april  whose operations are included as part of the iris diagnostics division 
our sample processing segment markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing 
the initial applications for our technology have been in the urinalysis market and we are the leading worldwide provider of urine microscopy systems  with an installed based of over  systems in over countries 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and sample processing instruments and supplies 
revenues from ivd instruments include sales of urine microscopy and chemistry analyzers manufactured by us and urine chemistry analyzers sourced from a japanese manufacturer 
we sell the urine microscopy analyzers and the ichem  our semi automated chemistry analyzer introduced in the third quarter of on a global basis 
we distribute the japanese manufacturer s fully automated chemistry analyzers domestically 
consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranty and spare parts from international customers 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue should continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
revenue is also generated from sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies  which primarily consists of centrifuge systems  dna processing workstations and blood analysis products 
domestic sales of our urinalysis systems are direct to the customer through our sales force 
international sales  with the exception of france which are sold direct to end use customers  are through independent distributors 
international sales represented of consolidated revenues during the year ended december  as compared to during the year ended december  since the launch of our iq product line  we have increased our sales efforts in the international marketplace 
since international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products  but we do not incur sales and marketing costs for such sales 
our sample processing products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors 
during the second quarter of  we closed the operations of our advanced digital imaging research subsidiary  or adir  whose costs had previously been substantially covered by government sponsored grants 
while the closing of adir resulted in a one time charge of approximately  in the second quarter of  period expenses related to this operation decreased slightly and we no longer incur costs related to salaries and related overhead of this subsidiary 
on april  we acquired leucadia technologies  inc  now named iris molecular diagnostics  or imd  a development stage molecular diagnostics company 
with this acquisition  we acquired significant core technology for an ultra sensitive protein detection and novel in vitro separation and concentration process  as well as in process research and development for bacteria and cancer detection applications 
pursuant to the imd acquisition agreement  we paid million of cash   shares of iris common stock  valued at million  deferred stock units for  shares of iris common stock valued at  and  of transaction fees 
the iris common stock and deferred stock units were valued based on the average closing market price of iris common stock a few days before and a few days following the acquisition 
in addition  we will issue up to  shares of iris common stock and deferred stock units for  shares of iris common stock as earn out consideration if certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 

table of contents on june   we completed the acquisition of the assets primarily technology and inventory of the urinalysis business of quidel corporation 
our total acquisition cost amounted to  with this acquisition  we acquired significant core technology and know how in urine chemistry strips  patents and trademarks  product designs  a strip manufacturing facility in germany and a semi automated urine chemistry analyzer that will enable us to offer a more complete product line internationally 
we have invested significant capital to acquire technologies and to increase our investment in research and development to advance our broad product pipeline in morphology  molecular diagnostics and sample processing 
research and development expense decreased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in which includes million of in process research and development expense from our acquisition of leucadia technologies 
we believe these significant investments in research and development will continue to address the need for automation and improved clinical utility within the major market segments of the in vitro diagnostics market 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met i an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  ii customer credit worthiness has been established  and ii delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements  which generally require revenue earned on product sales involving 
table of contents multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if sold separately 
multiple elements of certain domestic product sales include ivd instruments  training  consumables and service 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sale type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as investment in sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized when collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as i those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  ii those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest  or iii those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
we recognize that although we have introduced our new iq product line of analyzers  an installed based of our legacy products still exist 
we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to equal or do not exceed net realizable value 
goodwill and core technology our intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized and core technology  which is being amortized over its useful life of years 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis 
goodwill is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  based on various analyses  including a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value  cash flow and profitability projections 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
core technology is evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to a potential impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we evaluated goodwill and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with sfas no 
 substantially all of the goodwill resides in the ivd reporting unit 

table of contents capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation effective january  we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
r that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting january  compensation expense for new equity awards  in most cases  will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we began to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the fair value of those awards on their respective grant dates 
future periods will be impacted by the provisions of sfas r  the extent to which stock options granted during and additional options  if any  to be granted in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes results of operations data for the periods indicated 
the percentages in the table are based on total revenues with the exception of percentages for gross profit margins which are computed on related revenue

see reclassification note in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit margin percentages are based on the related sales of each category 
income tax percentage is computed based on the relationship of income taxes to pre tax income 
during  we acquired in process research and development amounting to million which is not deductible for tax purposes 
comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year to million from million in revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million in the prior year 
our unit volume of instruments sold during increased approximately with the number of units sold domestically remaining constant whereas the number of units sold internationally increased 
domestically  we sell the iq microscopy analyzers separately or combined with an automated chemistry analyzer we acquire from a japanese company 
the majority of domestic sales are sold as combined systems which carry a much higher average selling price 
internationally  we sell our iq microscopy analyzer separately or with our semi automated chemistry analyzer  as we do not have the distribution rights for the fully automated chemistry analyzer 

table of contents commencing in we expect to launch a fully automated chemistry analyzer  the ichem velocity that has been developed internally 
total international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue during compared to during sales of ivd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting warranty agreements to service agreements 
in addition  we continue to service and support the installed base of legacy systems discontinued in revenues from the sample processing instruments and supplies increased to million up from million  a increase over as this business segment has increased in almost all of its core express product lines 
overall gross profit margins increased from in to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments was in and  as our increased unit volume was derived almost entirely from the sale of lower margin international units 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and services increased to during compared to in the increase resulted from the continued leveraging of our german chemistry strip manufacturing operation  although it continues to operate below capacity until we launch of our new automated urine chemistry analyzer in in addition  gross profit margin improvement can be attributed to cost improvements in our services area 
gross profit margin for our sample processing laboratory instrument and supply segment increased from in to as a result of increased volume and cost saving initiatives 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million  higher commissions of  and higher fees paid to gpos of  general and administrative expenses amounted to million for both and this year we experienced increases in professional fees for audit and legal services of  and additional facility costs of  both years experienced finance department related restructuring costs  however during the year ended december   we reduced  of personnel related costs as a result of this transition 
research and development expense for the year ended amounted to and the year ended amounted to million of which million represents the purchased in process research and development expenses booked in the second quarter of relating to the acquisition of leucadia technologies  inc the current year period includes the cost of closing down the adir subsidiary  which amounted to approximately  during the current year  our spending  excluding the purchased in process research and development  increased by million and included higher payroll and related costs of  increased facility costs of  and incremental materials and supplies spending for our new chemistry analyzer amounting to  these costs were partially offset by incremental capitalized software development expenditures of  relating to our new products 
research and development expenses were net of reimbursed costs received by governmental grants from our adir subsidiary  which amounted to  and million for the and  respectively 
interest income during amounted to million  a  increase over and relates to our continued investment of excess cash during the year as well as interest earned on lease financing from the sale of instruments to customers 
our sales type lease financings increased to million at december  compared to million the prior year 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the decrease in the income tax provision resulted from the exclusion of million for purchased in process research and development not deductible for tax purposes in prior year 
the tax provision continues to be primarily a non cash expense  since we have significant deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
our federal tax loss carryforward amounts to approximately million as of december   net of valuation allowances 
in addition  we also have federal research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million 

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year 
revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million 
the increase in instrument sales is primarily due to increased sales to domestic customers as compared to international customers 
international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue during compared to during sales of ivd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of million or over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments 
revenues from the sample processing instruments and supplies increased to million up from million  a increase over this increase is primarily due to increased sales of new products including the express centrifuge and the thermobrite dna workstation 
our unit volume of instruments sold during was approximately the same as with the number of units sold domestically increasing by whereas the number of units sold internationally decreased 
included in the domestic increase were several multi site multi unit orders awarded by major laboratories and hospital chains in the second half of overall gross profit margins were in both and the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments increased to in up from in primarily due to increased sales of the iq sprint and the mix of instruments sold domestically versus internationally 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and services decreased to during compared to in the decrease resulted from the cost of our chemistry strip manufacturing operation acquired in june which is currently operating below capacity as well as increased costs associated with additional personnel for domestic service in order to improve customer service response times and a significant increase in the percentage of iq analyzers under warranty 
gross profit margin for our sample processing laboratory instrument and supply segment amounted to in both and marketing and selling expenses totaled million  as compared to million in  but as a percentage of revenues  marketing and selling expenses decreased to in versus in the increase includes additional personnel costs of  stock based compensation expense of  higher fees paid to gpos group purchasing organizations of  plus travel and related costs of  due to increased sales to domestic customers 
the increases were partially offset by decrease in professional fees of  and other selling costs totaling approximately  general and administrative expenses increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase includes severance and other costs relating to the cfo transitions during amounting to approximately  higher employee salaries and related benefits of  increased stock based compensation costs of  primarily associated with the adoption of sfas r  higher professional fees relating to auditing services and compliance with sarbanes oxley act section amounting to  and an increase in bad debt reserves of  research and development expense amounted to million during as compared to million in the prior year 
as a result of our acquisition of imd on april   we acquired significant in process research and development expense for bacteria and cancer detection applications which we valued at million and is included in our research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense also includes approximately million relating to molecular diagnostics programs initiated with our acquisition of leucadia technologies and approximately  of incremental development expenses primarily related to the design of our new automated urine chemistry analyzer for the international market 
research and development expenses were net of reimbursed costs received from governmental research and development grants for our adir subsidiary  which amounted to million and million during and 
table of contents interest income during amounted to million  a  increase over and relates to our continued investment of excess cash during the year as well as interest earned on lease financing from the sale of instruments to customers 
our sales type lease financings increased to million at december  compared to million the prior year 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the increase in the income tax provision results from the exclusion of million for purchased in process research and development not deductible for tax purposes 
the tax provision continues to be primarily a non cash expense  since we have significant deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards 
our federal tax loss carryforward amounts to approximately million as of december  in addition  we also have research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million  net of valuation allowances 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
operating cash flows 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million in the prior year 
our results of operations included million in non cash items as follows million in deferred taxes  million from depreciation and amortization and million stock based compensation expense 
in addition cash flow was weakened by million of increased accounts receivable and higher inventory levels 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable increased slightly to at the end of compared to days at the end of due primarily to a higher proportion of sales made to international customers 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable vary and extend due to the fact that our customers are subject to reimbursement delays attributed to government and third party payer compliance and regulation issues 
the number of days sales in inventory increased to days at the end of compared to days at the end of the increase in days sales in inventory is due primarily to the ramp up of finished goods and raw materials in preparation for the launch of the ichem velocity 

table of contents our cash flow continues to be favorably affected by tax loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had  net of valuation allowances  federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  which expire in various years through we also have tax credit carry forwards of  and  for federal and state  respectively 
we continue to realize tax deductions from both the exercise of stock options and the purchase by employees of our common stock at a discount to market 
during the year ended december   we realized tax deductions of approximately million relating to these items 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in primarily as a result of additions to property and equipment of million  and investment in software development of million 
property and equipment expenditures in totaled million which includes million for facility expansion and upgrading our california and massachusetts locations  million for machinery and equipment 
financing activities 
for the year ended december   financing activities provided million primarily from the issuances of common stock for stock options as well as purchases of shares by employees through our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of million compared to million in we also realized tax deductions benefits from the exercise of stock options of approximately million during compared to million for we currently have a credit facility with a commercial bank consisting of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory 
the entire credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the new credit facility 
we are subject to certain financial and non financial covenants under the credit facility with the bank and as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
in november  we filed a form s shelf registration statement  or the million shelf  to provide for financial flexibility 
the million shelf allows us to issue common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
under the million shelf  all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
at december  the form s registration statement was declared effective 
as of december   no securities had been issued under the million shelf 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility with the bank will be sufficient to fund normal operations 
however  additional funding may be required to fund expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available  on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasbissued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning december  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change 
table of contents in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning december  and will apply prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
currently  there is no impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
 which is an interpretation of the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing that a benefit can not be recorded in the financial statements unless the tax position has a more likely than not chance of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position 
once the more likely than not standard is met  the benefit is measured by determining the amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement  presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
upon adoption  we recognized a  charge to our beginning consolidated stockholders equity as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined what election  if any  will be made 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  except for the measurement of share based payments 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position that delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed at least annually 
except for this delay  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within such years 
we will adopt sfas as of january   as required 
we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not invest in derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we had no debt at december  foreign currencies we are subject to certain foreign currency risks in the importation of goods from japan 
our purchases from this supplier are denominated in japanese yen 
these components represent a significant portion of our material costs 
fluctuations in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate could result in increased costs for our key components 
similarly  we are also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the exportation of our products 
with the exception of france which is denominated in euros  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
our strip manufacturing facility in germany has the euro as its functional currency
