table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  potential failure to achieve production from development projects  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we focus our oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation and developmental operations on projects located in the western united states 
we have funded our operations with a combination of cash received from the sale of our equity  cash flow generated from oil and gas operations  and from proceeds received from the sale of certain of our oil and gas assets 
we intend to increase stockholder value by profitably growing reserves and production primarily through drilling operations 
our company began oil and gas operations in january  with the purchase of interests in undeveloped acreage from two private companies denver  colorado based tower colombia corporation tcc and casper  wyoming based north finn llc 
in april  we completed a merger with tcc and we currently retain a strategic alliance with north finn 
we currently own interests in approximately  gross  net acres primarily in the powder river basin of wyoming and in the williston basin of north dakota 
in addition to focusing on drilling within our existing projects  we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our project portfolio 
we believe that our existing project portfolio provides us with the opportunity to rapidly grow reserves and cash flow if we are able to prove that our acreage positions can be developed in a commercial fashion 
a number of unprofitable wells may need to be drilled while we test various drilling  completion and stimulation methods 
we have been able to reduce or eliminate our financial exposure in the initial drilling in our projects by creating joint venture arrangements that provide for others to pay for all or a disproportionate share of the initial drilling costs 
this has allowed us to move forward in drilling a greater number of wells than if we were to drill these wells on our own 
we expect to continue to use industry relationships to partially or completely fund initial drilling 
within the main focus areas of our existing project portfolio  we expect the following drilling activity  and our share of the cost of that drilling activity to occur in approximate expected net expected working capital project wells interest required in millions fetter project converse county  wy krejci project niobrara county  wy goliath project williams county  nd total drilling activity 
table of contents we have not entered into any commodity derivative arrangements or hedging transactions 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may enter into commodity swap and or hedging transactions in the future in conjunction with oil and gas production 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources we currently do not generate meaningful cash flow from our oil and natural gas operating activities  even though our future depends on our ability to generate oil and natural gas operating cash flow 
we recognize that net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes and commodity prices  both of which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  as well as operating efficiency and capital spending 
our business is a depleting one in which each barrel of oil equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically funded our oil and natural gas activities primarily through the sale of our equity  from the sale of certain oil and gas assets and to a lesser extent  internally generated cash flows 
due to our active oil and natural gas activities  we currently anticipate capital requirements in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land  and geological and geophysical activities  and million relates to our general and administrative expenses 
we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures  other commitments and working capital requirements with existing capital and expected cash flow from operations 
however  we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
we may expand or reduce our capital expenditures depending on  among other things  the results of future wells  and our available capital 
as of december   we had  in short term investments in aaa credit rated auction market preferred stocks amps issued by various us mutual funds 
these auction rate securities normally provide liquidity via an auction process occurring every days or every days  at which time the dividend rate is reset 
dividends on these securities are paid on the day after the scheduled auction date 
recently  these auctions and similar auctions have had insufficient bids to buy the securities from those wishing to sell 
on march   we owned auction rate securities with a par value of  that we could not immediately liquidate at par value 
to increase our cash balances to approximately  we borrowed  on march  from an affiliate of our broker 
the loan is secured by our amps investments and matures on september  the note payable bears interest currently approximating a annual rate 
the rate will change with changes in the overnight libor 
we plan to pay the interest from the amps weekly and monthly dividends  which on average currently approximate a annual rate and are typically set at to of libor or aa commercial paper rates for the payment month 
we seek to liquidate our amps as soon as possible 
our  in amps were issued by closed end taxable us mutual funds investing in corporate securities  rather than muni tax free securities 
closed end mutual funds managed by calamos advisors llc calamos issued  of our amps 
on march   calamos issued a statement that it is evaluating solutions to provide liquidity to amps holders and that the solution calamos settles upon as a sponsor must address our intent to return dollar for dollar the investment that preferred security holders entrusted to the funds 


eaton vance and nuveen  the managers of sixteen similar taxable closed end funds have recently announced that they have arranged debt financing to allow their taxable closed end mutual funds to redeem fully or begin redeeming their billion of amps 
on march   the federal reserve announced a program to provide up to billion in short term treasury securities to major wall street investment firms and banks 
if we are able to redeem or sell at par value our  in calamos amps in april  we believe we could still borrow  on the remaining  of amps 
in addition to taking our amps for sale at their day and day auctions  we are evaluating other liquidity options 
if  and to the extent  we are unable to substantially liquidate the amps in  we may need to raise cash by other means to fully fund our future capital expenditures 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided used by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million decrease in operating cash flow in compared with is primarily due to a million decline in oil and gas revenue receipts largely arising from the march  sale of our big sky project 
cash basis general and administrative payments increased by million in compared with investment income increased million in compared with from short term investment of cash proceeds from the sale of our big sky project 
the decrease in operating cash flow from to primarily occurred due to our sale of our big sky project in march of net cash used in investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for was million 
in we invested million in short term investments and sold in million of those investments to fund in a substantial portion of our capital expenditures 
our oil and natural gas operations are capital intensive  and we invest a substantial portion of our available capital in the acquisition  exploration and development of our oil and gas properties 
we used during million of cash for capital expenditures relating to our oil and natural gas operations 
we received in approximately million in cash relating to a sale of oil and gas assets 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to our share of the drilling and completion of several wells million for completing five wells drilled in  million for three wells drilled and substantially completed in  million for two shallow dry holes in and million for five wells begun in and to be completed in in  rta paid of the costs of four new wells in which we retained working interests equivalent to net wells 
other spending included million primarily attributable to acquisitions of additional leases 
during  we participated in the drilling of a total of twelve gross net wells 
of these wells  four gross net were productive wells and six gross net are not yet completed for production testing 
the other two gross net wells drilled in were shallow dry holes that extended lease lives 
during the year ended december   we used million relating to our oil and natural gas operations  and we used  primarily for the acquisition of furniture and equipment relating to our office move 
we offset these amounts by selling oil and gas assets for approximately million  leaving our net capital used in investing activities for at  capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of twelve gross wells  ten of which were successful 
other spending included million primarily attributable to land holdings and capitalized g a 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of seventeen gross wells  fifteen of which were successful 
other spending included million attributable to land holdings and  of capital expenditures associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  came primarily from net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million with an additional million received from the exercise of warrants and options 
for the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of  came from the exercise of warrants and options 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale of our series aa convertible preferred stock and received  from the exercise of common stock warrants exercised in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december   as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of  
per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december  for  we recognized  of other revenues but had no gains from property sales  no service fee revenues and no impairment expense 
included in the net income for are i  in gains  after tax effect from the sale of oil and gas properties  ii  in service fee revenue and iii impairment expense of  
table of contents oil and gas operations for  we had total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for oil and gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
oil sales volumes decreased in compared with due to the sale of our interests in the oil producing wells in the big sky project 
gas sales volumes increased in over largely due to gas produced and sold from a new well in our fetter project 
year ended december  oil sold barrels average oil price oil revenue gas sold mcf average gas price gas revenue total oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses less oil gas amortization expense less accretion of discount less impairments producing revenues less direct expenses less intangible asset amortization less depreciation of office facilities less general and administrative expenses add service fee revenue and other revenues income loss from operations total barrels of oil equivalent boe sold lease operating expense per boe sold amortization expense per boe sold impairments we use the full cost accounting method  which requires recognition of an impairment of oil and gas properties when the total capitalized costs net of related deferred income taxes exceed a ceiling 
our initial ceiling test calculation as of december   using oil and gas prices on that date indicated an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties of approximately million  net of income tax 
however  sec guidance in applying the ceiling test requires consideration of subsequent price increases prior to the filing of the form k 
with consideration of oil and gas prices at the end of february  the ceiling exceeded total capitalized costs  eliminating the calculated impairment 
as a result  we did not recognize an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties at december  under the full cost method of accounting 
for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment against our evaluated oil and gas properties in the amount of million 
a substantial portion of the impairment occurred during the fourth quarter and results from being unable to complete the fetter project state well in a fashion as originally planned  which reduced the estimate of proved reserves as of december  for the well 
we did not record any impairment for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses we recorded million and million in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the million increase in compared with is due primarily to a  net increase in employee compensation and a  increase in costs of financial auditing and attestation of internal controls over financial reporting 
in  we increased our number of employees from thirteen to fifteen but reduced employee share based compensation by  

table of contents service fee revenue in in we received a  convertible note from gsl energy corp 
as a service fee for successfully assisting in acquiring additional montana lease acreage that was not suitable for our acreage portfolio 
we subsequently converted the  note into  shares of gsl common stock at per share 
gsl subsequently merged into publicly held petrohunter energy corp 
we did not generate any service fee revenue in or in gains on sales in of oil and gas properties we recorded million in gains from the sale of oil and gas properties million after tax effect during the year ended december  the reconciliations of the gains on the sales are as follows big sky bear creek goliath totals contract sales price effective date adjustments adjusted sales price allocated capitalized costs using the relative fair market value method required under full cost accounting recognized gains on sales of oil and gas properties investment income we recorded  and  in investment income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in investment income results from higher short term interest rates in and from our short term investment of approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock in april income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a  provision for deferred income taxes and recorded a  provision for the year ended december  the  deferred tax reduction is of the  net loss for as compared to a combined statutory rate for federal and state income taxes 
dividends for the year ended december   we recorded  million from dividends attributable to our  shares of series aa convertible preferred stock  outstanding throughout for the year ended december   we recorded  of preferred stock dividends 
the decline from is due to approximately of preferred shares outstanding during being converted to common stock in early january in  we recorded  deemed dividends for the estimated fair value of warrant extensions in we had no warrant extensions in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded net income attributable to common stockholders of  income of per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december   as compared to a net income attributable to common stockholders of  income of 
per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december  
table of contents oil and gas operations for the year ended december   we recorded total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the revenue decline is the sale on march  of our interest in the big sky producing property that accounted for substantially all of our revenues in through march  oil and gas sales and production costs are summarized in the table that follows 
year ended december  oil sold barrels average oil price oil revenue gas sold mcf average gas price gas revenue total oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses less oil gas amortization expense less accretion of discount less impairments producing revenues less direct expenses less intangible asset amortization less depreciation of office facilities less general and administrative expenses add service fee revenue income loss from operations total barrels of oil equivalent boe sold lease operating expense per boe sold amortization expense per boe sold general and administrative expenses we recorded million and million in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the primary differences is million recorded for the year ended december  pursuant to our january  adoption of fas r share based payments  an increase in salaries and salaries related expense of  which results from increasing the number of full time employees hired to support our expanding oil and gas operations  from eight employees at december   to thirteen employees at december   and an increase in accounting and audit related expenses of  due to our implementation of controls and procedures required pursuant to sarbanes oxley 
investment income we recorded  and  in investment income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in and  we typically invested our excess cash in short term investments and money market accounts 
the increase in investment income results from a higher excess cash balance and from higher interest rates in over income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a  provision for deferred income taxes and recorded a  provision for the year ended december  the  provision reflects a projected effective deferred tax rate for the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion 

table of contents preferred dividends for the year ended december   we recorded million from dividends attributable to our outstanding series aa convertible preferred stock  which was outstanding for the full year 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in preferred dividends attributable to our outstanding series aa convertible preferred stock  which was represents dividends payable from july  through december  and from our then outstanding series a convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock was converted into common shares during january critical accounting policies and estimates full cost accounting method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration  development and estimated abandonment costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs  incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property or impairment 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
we amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through dd a using the units of production method 
under the units of production method  the quarterly provision for dd a is computed by dividing production volumes for the period by the total proved reserves as of the beginning of the period  and applying the respective rate to the net cost of proved oil and gas properties  including future development costs 
we capitalize the portion of salaries  general and administrative expenses that are attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under the full cost method of accounting  we compare  at the end of each financial reporting period  the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves based on period end hedge adjusted commodity prices and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs  to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of related deferred taxes 
this comparison is referred to as a ceiling test 
if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves  we are required to write down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows 
revenue recognition we record revenues from the sales of natural gas and oil when in the month that delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when natural gas or oil has been delivered to a pipeline or a tank lifting has occurred 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
however  differences have been insignificant 
natural gas imbalances we may have an interest with other producers in certain properties  in which case we use the sales method to account for natural gas imbalances 
under this method  revenue is recorded on the basis of natural gas we actually sell 
in addition  we may record revenue for our share of natural gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
we also reduce revenue for other owners natural gas we sell that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
our remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved reserves 
as of december  and our produced natural gas volumes were in balance 

table of contents asset retirement obligation our accounting for asset retirement obligations is governed by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires us to record our estimate of the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
asset retirement obligations relate to the removal of facilities and tangible equipment at the end of an oil and gas property s useful life 
the adoption of sfas no 
requires the use of management s estimates with respect to future abandonment costs  inflation  market risk premiums  useful life and cost of capital 
as required by sfas no 
 our estimate of our asset retirement obligations does not give consideration to the value the related assets could have to other parties 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the provisions of the new standard effective january  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we used the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
we recorded non cash stock based compensation of million   and  in  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which eliminates the exemption from applying sfas to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the instrument s form 
sfas allows the election of fair value measurement at acquisition  at issuance  or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a re measurement event 
adoption is required for all financial instruments acquired or issued by the company after we adopted sfas effective january   but adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for servicing of financial assets  which requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value 
sfas permits  but does not require  the subsequent measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value 
we do not have servicing assets or servicing liabilities to which sfas relates 
we adopted sfas effective january   but adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective for the company on january  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on measurement  classification  interim accounting and disclosure 
we adopted fin effective january   but adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp and fsp  which amend sfas fsp amends sfas to exclude certain lease transactions accounted for under other accounting pronouncements 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are adopting sfas effective january  except the effective date is january  for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities as provided in fsp management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement plans 
we do not have postretirement plans 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we elected not to adopt the fair value option for assets and liabilities held on the january  effective date 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas  non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb  which establishes accounting and reporting standards with regards to non controlling interests  previously known as minority interests 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january   but we have no non controlling interests 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  which significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of many business combination transactions  with an emphasis on valuing at fair value as of the acquisition date the related acquired assets and liabilities and any non controlling interests of the acquired business 
we are required to adopt sfas r on january   and it would apply prospectively  ie  to any acquisitions we make on or after that date 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk because of our relatively low level of current oil and gas production  we are not exposed to a great degree of market risk relating to the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
however  our ability to raise additional capital at attractive pricing  our future revenues from oil and gas operations  our future profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and natural gas  which fluctuate widely 
we expect commodity price volatility to continue 
we do not currently utilize hedging contracts to protect against commodity price risk 
as our oil and gas production grows  we may manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price declines by entering into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements to secure a price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production 
operating cost risk we have experienced rising operating costs which impacts our cash flow from operating activities and profitability 
we recognize that rising operating costs could continue and continued rising operating costs would negatively impact our oil and gas operations 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our  in short term investments in auction market preferred stock or arms  and the recent borrowing of  secured by those arms 
both the arms dividend rate and the relate note s interest rate are factors of short term index rates  such as libor 
an immediate increase in short term interest rates would have an insignificant increase in dividend income and be substantially offset by the increase in interest expense on the recent borrowing
