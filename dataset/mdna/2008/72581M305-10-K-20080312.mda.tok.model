overview we are an innovative designer  developer and marketer of video and pixel processing semiconductors and software for high end digital video applications 
our solutions enable manufacturers of digital display and projection devices  such as large screen liquid crystal display lcd televisions and multimedia projectors  to differentiate their products with a consistently high level of video quality  regardless of the content s source or format 
our core technology leverages unique proprietary techniques for intelligently processing video signals from a variety of sources to ensure that all resulting images are optimized for a specific digital display or projection device 
additionally  our products help our customers reduce costs and differentiate their display and projection devices  an important factor in industries that experience rapid innovation 
pixelworks flexible design architecture enables our technology to produce outstanding image quality in our customers display and projection products with a range of integrated circuit ic and software solutions 
pixelworks was founded in and is incorporated under the laws of the state of oregon 
over the course of the last several years  the display and projection industries have moved rapidly from analog technology  which utilizes waveform signals  to a new generation of digital technologies that utilize a grid of thousands of tiny picture elements  or pixels 
accordingly  the video image processors that drive these displays have had to increase their capabilities as well to keep pace with the ever growing needs for greater resolution  size and speed that digital technology affords 
pixelworks has a broad array of proprietary technologies and advanced designs to address the requirements of diverse high end digital video applications  from digital projectors to large screen lcd televisions 
our products range from single purpose ics  to system on chip soc ics that integrate microprocessor  memory and image processing functions 
during we focused on developing products that provide additional functionality and utilize more advanced processes in order to improve performance and lower product costs 
we introduced the first of these co processor ics in early we expand our technology portfolio through internal developments  acquisitions and co developments with business partners 
we have adopted a product strategy that leverages our core competencies in video processing to address the evolving needs of the high end flat panel display  digital projection and other markets that require superior image quality 
we focus our product investments on developing video enhancement solutions for the high end flat panel display market  such as large  high definition lcd tvs  and for the digital projector market  with particular focus on adding increased performance and functionality 
additionally  we look for ways to leverage our research and development investment into products that address high value markets where our innovative proprietary technology provides differentiation for us and our customers 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force and indirectly through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  china  europe and the u 
s  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our european and korean sales 
sales to distributors represented   and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to tokyo electron device  ltd 
ted  our japanese distributor  represented  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to seiko 
table of contents epson corporation  our top end customer  represented  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 
significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately of revenue for the years ended december   and our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition restructuring plans in november  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and continued to implement this plan throughout this plan includes consolidation of our operations in order to reduce compensation and rent expense  while at the same time making critical infrastructure investments in people  processes and information systems to improve our operating efficiency 
in april  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our breakeven point by decreasing manufacturing overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business 
the plan included integrating the internet protocol television iptv technology that we acquired from equator technologies  inc equator with our advanced television technology developments and no longer pursuing stand alone advanced media processor markets 
in october  we initiated a restructuring plan to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of our product development programs in an effort to reduce our overall development costs 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction in force during the fourth quarter of goodwill and intangible asset impairments during  we performed impairment analyses on the intangible assets that we acquired from equator and on our goodwill 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million on the acquired intangible assets 
this impairment loss represented the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million on goodwill 
this impairment loss represented the excess carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill

during the year ended december  we wrote off assets with a net book value of million as a result of our restructuring plans 
these assets consisted primarily of engineering software tools which we are no longer using due to the reductions in research and development personnel and changes in product development strategy 
we also reversed accrued liabilities in the amount of million related to the write off of the engineering software tools 

table of contents during the year ended december  we wrote off assets with a net book value of million as a result of our restructuring plans

we paid a contract termination fee of million during the year ended december  to cancel a software license agreement prior to its expiration 
expenses related to the consolidation of leased space included future non cancelable rent payments due for vacated space net of estimated sublease income and moving expenses 
non cancelable contract payments consist of amounts that we were obligated to pay  but for which we will not realize a benefit due to the restructuring plans

interest expense primarily relates to interest payable on our long term debt 
the fees associated with the issuance of our long term debt have been capitalized and are being amortized over a period of seven years 
the remaining amortization period is approximately three years as of december  during the fourth quarter of  our claim against funds placed in escrow in connection with the equator acquisition was settled 
in the settlement  we received proceeds of million net of legal fees 
in february  we repurchased and retired million of our outstanding debt for million cash 
we recognized a gain on this repurchase of million net of a write off of debt issuance costs of during the second quarter of  we realized a loss on the sale of marketable securities of  the proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to fund the acquisition of equator 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was as follows in thousands year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes the income tax provision recorded for the year ended december  is comprised of current and deferred tax expense in profitable foreign jurisdictions and accruals for tax contingencies in foreign jurisdictions 
at december   we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against our us and canadian deferred tax assets as we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from those assets 
we did not record a valuation allowance against our other foreign deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from those assets 
as of december   we have generated deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and federal  state and foreign research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
general foreign tax credits were million at december  the carryforwards began expiring in utilization of a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
an ownership change subject to these provisions occurred for ndsp in and equator in when we acquired these entities 
additionally  we have undertaken a study to determine whether an ownership change has occurred for pixelworks  inc we are uncertain if such a change has occurred and  if it has  by how much our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited 
we anticipate completion of this analysis by the end of the first quarter of the income tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  resulted primarily from an income tax refund that was received through a net operating loss carryback to a prior year  plus the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions 
these benefits were partially offset by current tax in foreign jurisdictions and accruals for foreign tax contingencies 
the income tax provision recorded for the year ended december  was attributable to the addition of approximately million of valuation allowance against essentially all deferred tax assets  plus accruals for tax contingencies in foreign jurisdictions 
the tax detriment of these items was partially offset by federal  state and foreign tax credits and tax exempt interest generated during the year  and a refund relating to our canadian subsidiary s foreign research and experimentation credits 
business outlook on january   we provided an outlook for the first quarter of in our earnings release  which was furnished on a current report on form k

these decreases were partially offset by increases that resulted from a decrease in working capital excluding cash and marketable securities and million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we used million of our cash and marketable securities to repurchase million of our outstanding convertible subordinate debentures due in a modified dutch auction tender offer 
additionally  between january  and february   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for  under the plan approved in september see capital resources below 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investment balances will be adequate to fund our operating and investing needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may consume a material portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in dilution to existing shareholders

capital resources on may   we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures the debentures due on june   we issued an additional million of debentures pursuant to the exercise of an option granted to the initial purchasers 

table of contents in february  we repurchased and retired million of the debentures 
in january  we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer under which we offered to purchase  for cash  up to million aggregate principal amount of the debentures at a price not greater than nor less than per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
the tender offer expired on february   and on march   we announced that we had accepted for purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of the debentures at a purchase price of per  principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but not including  the date of purchase for a total cost of approximately million 
the total amount of outstanding debentures after the purchase is approximately million 
the debentures bear interest at a rate of per annum and interest is payable on may and november of each year 
the debentures are convertible  under certain circumstances  into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures  for a total of  shares 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
we may redeem some or all of the remaining million of debentures for cash on or after may  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of the debentures have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the remaining million of debentures on may   may  and may  at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on september   we announced a share repurchase program under which the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock over the next twelve months 
during we repurchased  common shares at a cost of million 
as of december   million remained available for repurchase under the plan and between january  and february  we repurchased an additional  shares for  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  intangible assets  valuation of share based payments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when an authorized purchase order has been received  title and risk of loss have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs upon shipment of the underlying merchandise 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific customer and we subsequently lower the price to the customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated 
table of contents margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
the reserve for price protection is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write off experience and the age of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we record a reserve against our inventory for estimated obsolete  unmarketable  and otherwise impaired products by calculating the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we review our inventory at the end of each reporting period for valuation issues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the reserve was recorded  additional inventory write downs may be required 
useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of share based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
when there are changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of the share based payments  which results in variation in the compensation cost recognized 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  we conduct a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions regularly 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases payments on accrued balances related to asset purchases estimated q purchase commitments to contract manufacturers the earliest date on which the remaining holders of our convertible subordinated debentures due have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding debentures is may  we expect holders of the debentures to require us to purchase all of the outstanding debentures on that date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
we mitigate risks associated with such fluctuations  as well as the risk of loss of principal  by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had convertible subordinated debentures of million outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
interest rate changes affect the fair value of the debentures  but do not affect our earnings or cash flow 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales 
we have employees located in offices in canada  japan  taiwan and the people s republic of china and as such  a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our operating results or cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations
