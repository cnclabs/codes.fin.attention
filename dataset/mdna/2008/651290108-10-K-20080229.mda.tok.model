table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties 
our domestic areas of operation include the anadarko and arkoma basins of the mid continent  the rocky mountains  onshore texas and the gulf of mexico 
internationally  we are active in malaysia and china 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
reserve replacement 
to maintain and grow our production and cash flow  we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant estimates 
we believe the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  the timing of future drilling  development and abandonment activities  the cost of these activities in the future  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  the value of our derivative positions  and the fair value of stock based compensation 
accounting for hedging activities 
beginning october   we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates commodity derivative activities 

table of contents results of operations significant transactions 
we completed several significant transactions during that affect the comparability of our results from period to period and that had a meaningful impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
in june  we acquired stone energy corporation s rocky mountain assets for million in cash 
initially  we financed this acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
in august  we sold our shallow water gulf of mexico assets for billion in cash and the purchaser s assumption of liabilities associated with future abandonment of wells and platforms 
in september  we sold our coal bed methane assets in the cherokee basin of northeastern oklahoma for million in cash 
in october  we sold all of our interests in the uk north sea for million in cash 
the historical results of operations of our uk north sea subsidiaries are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
this reclassification affects not only the presentation of our financial statements  but also the presentation of all prior period financial statements 
except where noted  discussions in this report relate to continuing operations only 
please see note  discontinued operations  and note  oil and gas assets  to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion regarding these transactions 
revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production 
the effects of the settlement of hedges designated for hedge accounting are included in revenues  but those not so designated have no effect on our reported revenues 
none of our outstanding hedges are designated for hedge accounting 
please see note  commodity derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
in addition  crude oil from our operations offshore malaysia and china is produced into fpsos and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated 
revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold  not when it is produced into the fpso 
as a result  the timing of liftings may impact period to period results 
revenues of billion for were higher than revenues due to higher oil production and higher oil prices partially offset by lower gas production and lower gas prices 
revenues of billion for were lower than revenues due to lower gas prices and oil production partially offset by higher oil prices and increased gas production

domestic production 
our domestic gas and oil production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis decreased from our natural gas production decreased primarily as a result of the sale of our shallow water gulf of mexico assets in august this decrease was partially offset by an increase in production in the mid continent as a result of successful drilling efforts and in the rocky mountains as a result of our acquisition there in june our gulf of mexico production was negatively impacted bcfe by production deferrals related to hurricanes katrina and rita in our domestic oil and condensate production increased over primarily due to increased sales from our monument butte field

our international oil and gas production decreased from due to the timing of liftings of oil production in malaysia 
operating expenses 
we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production  or per mcfe  basis 
year ended december  compared to december  the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december  unit of production amount year ended percentage year ended percentage december  increase december  increase decrease decrease per mcfe in millions united states lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative other total operating expenses international lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test writedown total operating expenses total lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test writedown other total operating expenses 
table of contents domestic operations 
our total domestic operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the period to period change was primarily related to the following items lease operating expense loe in was adversely impacted by higher operating costs for all of our operations and ongoing repair expenditures of million per mcfe related to the storms 
the increase was offset by the sale of all of our producing properties in the shallow water gulf of mexico in august  which properties have relatively high loe per mcfe 
without the impact of the repair expenditures related to the storms  our loe would have been per mcfe 
our loe was negatively impacted by the difference per mcfe between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of claims related to the storms and actual repair expenditures during without the impact of the costs related to the repairs for the storms in excess of our insured amounts  our loe would have been per mcfe 
production and other taxes increased per mcfe because of an increase in the proportion of our production subject to taxes as a result of increased production from our mid continent and rocky mountain operations and the gulf of mexico property sale 
in addition  during  we recorded refunds of million per mcfe related to production tax exemptions on certain high cost gas wells  compared to refunds of only million per mcfe recorded during the increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions  offset by the proceeds from the gulf of mexico property sale and the sale of our coal bed methane assets in the cherokee basin 
the component of dd a associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was per mcfe for and per mcfe for the decrease in accretion expense is due to the significant reduction in our asset retirement obligation resulting from the gulf of mexico property sale 
please see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies accounting for asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative g a expense increased per mcfe in due to additional bonus expense of million per mcfe under our incentive compensation plan associated with the gain from the sale of our interests in the uk north sea  an increase in a litigation settlement reserve associated with a statewide royalty owner class action lawsuit in oklahoma and continued growth in our workforce 
during  we capitalized million per mcfe of direct internal costs as compared to million per mcfe in capitalized direct internal costs in include million per mcfe related to additional bonus expense associated with the uk north sea sale 
other expenses for include the following items in  we redeemed all million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due we recorded a charge for the million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs for the notes 
in  we recorded a million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the storms 
international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased compared to the period to period change was primarily related to the following items total loe increased significantly due to increased liftings in malaysia and china during loe  on an mcfe basis  increased due to higher operating costs for our international operations 
production and other taxes increased per mcfe primarily due to an increase in the tax rate per unit for our oil in malaysia as a result of substantially higher oil prices

our domestic operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the period to period change was primarily related to the following items loe increased due to higher operating costs for all of our operations and significantly higher insurance costs for our gulf of mexico operations 
additionally  loe was negatively impacted by the difference per mcfe between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of all claims related to the storms and actual repair expenditures during without the impact of this difference  our loe would have been per mcfe for production and other taxes decreased primarily due to refunds of million per mcfe related to production tax exemptions on certain of our onshore high cost gas wells in texas 
the increase in our dd a rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions 
the cost of reserve additions was adversely impacted by escalating costs of drilling goods and services experienced during 
table of contents the component of dd a associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was per mcfe for and g a expense increased approximately per mcfe primarily due to stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on january  please see note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase attributable to stock based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense as a result of lower adjusted net income as defined in our incentive compensation plan in as compared to the prior year 
adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
during  we capitalized million per mcfe of direct internal costs as compared to million per mcfe in other expenses for and include the following items in  we redeemed all million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due we recorded a charge for the million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs for the notes 
in  we recorded a million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the storms 
in  we recorded a million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage and sold our interest in the floating production system and related equipment we acquired in the eex transaction for a net gain of million 
international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the increase was primarily related to the following items loe increased because our production in malaysia decreased while total loe remained relatively unchanged 
our malaysian loe primarily consists of fixed costs related to our fpsos 
production and other taxes increased as a result of higher realized crude oil prices 
the dd a rate increased as a result of higher cost reserve additions in malaysia and the commencement of liftings of oil production in china in august g a expense increased due to stock compensation expense recognized as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  and growth in our international workforce 
we recorded a ceiling test writedown of million associated with ceasing our exploration efforts in brazil in in  we recorded a ceiling test writedown of million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in brazil and in other non core international regions 
interest expense 
the following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in millions gross interest expense capitalized interest net interest expense the increase in gross interest expense in resulted primarily from higher average debt levels outstanding under our credit arrangements as compared to prior to the sale of our shallow water gulf of mexico assets  we financed our capital shortfall and the acquisition of stone energy s rocky mountain assets with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
following the sale  we repaid all of our 
table of contents outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements and million principal amount of our senior notes that became due in october the increase in gross interest expense in resulted primarily from the april  issuance of million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  partially offset by the may  redemption of million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due commodity derivative income expense 
the following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative income expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in millions cash flow hedges hedge ineffectiveness other derivative contracts realized loss on settlement of discontinued cash flow hedges unrealized gain loss due to change in fair market value realized gain loss on settlement total commodity derivative income expense hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
in the third quarter of  as a result of the production deferrals experienced in the gulf of mexico related to the storms  hedge accounting was discontinued on a portion of our contracts that had previously qualified as effective cash flow hedges of our gulf of mexico production and other contracts were redesignated as hedges of our onshore gulf coast production 
as a result  realized losses of million associated with derivative contracts for the third and fourth quarters of  which were in excess of hedged physical deliveries for those periods  were reported as commodity derivative expense 
the unrealized gain loss due to changes in fair market value is associated with our derivative contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting and represents changes in the fair value of these open contracts during the period 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was more than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to state income taxes and the differences between international and us federal statutory rates 
our effective tax rate for increased because million of interest income on intercompany loans to our international subsidiaries was included in the determination of us federal income taxes 
however  the related intercompany interest expense was incurred by several of our international subsidiaries that are located in non taxing international jurisdictions 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  the timing and amount of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow 
we accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year 
our capital budget currently exceeds expected cash flow from operations and cash and short term investments on hand at year end by approximately million 
we anticipate that the shortfall will be made up with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
to the extent that we increase our capital budget during  we anticipate funding these amounts with borrowings under our credit arrangements 

table of contents credit arrangements 
in june  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in june and provides for initial loan commitments of billion from a syndicate of financial institutions  led by jpmorgan chase as agent 
the loan commitments may be increased to a maximum of billion if the existing lenders increase their loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility 
subject to compliance with covenants in our credit facility that restrict our ability to incur additional debt  we also have a total of million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions 
for a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements  please see note  debt  to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report 
at february   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility nor under our money market lines of credit and we had approximately billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
without the effects of commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital because our capital spending generally has exceeded our cash flows from operations and we generally use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
our current assets include million of cash and short term investments remaining from the proceeds of property sales 
our working capital position at december  was positively affected by a reduction in our asset retirement obligation of million due to the sale of our shallow water gulf of mexico assets 
at december   our working capital deficit included a short term net derivative liability of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million at the end of and million at the end of the majority of the working capital deficit at december  relates to the reclassification of million principal amount of our senior notes due october  as a current liability and an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of our significant capital activities near the end of the increase in accrued liabilities is due to our increased exploration and development activity and higher service costs over our working capital deficit also includes million in asset retirement obligations compared to million in our working capital includes a short term net derivative asset of million and our working capital includes a short term net derivative liability of million 
cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations both continuing and discontinued are primarily affected by production and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital 
we also have experienced fluctuations in operating cash flows as a result of higher operating costs for all of our operations and activities associated with the storms 
in august  we reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle all claims related to the storms business interruption  property damage and control of well operator s extra expense for million 
during  we incurred million of repair expenditures in excess of the insurance benefits received as compared to million of uninsured repairs during these amounts are reflected as a use of operating cash flows in the respective year 
we sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts 
however  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next months 
see oil and gas hedging below 
we typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by dd a  writedowns or other non cash charges or credits 
our net cash flow from operations was billion in  a decrease of compared to net cash flow from operations of billion in although our production volumes were impacted by our property sales  higher commodity prices offset the cash flow impact of the property sales 
realized oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis  including the effects of hedging contracts regardless of whether 
table of contents designated for hedge accounting  increased over our working capital requirements during increased compared to as a result of increased drilling activities  the timing of payments made by us to vendors and other operators  and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operators 
our net cash flow from operations was billion in  a increase over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to realized oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis  including the effects of hedging contracts regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting  which increased over see results of operations above 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities both continuing and discontinued for was million compared to billion for during  we spent billion including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  received proceeds of billion from sales of us oil and gas properties billion from our shallow water gulf of mexico assets  million from our coal bed methane assets in the cherokee basin of oklahoma and million from various other oil and gas properties  received proceeds of million net of cash on hand at the date of sale for the sale of our interests in the uk north sea  and purchased short term investments of million and redeemed short term investments of million 
during  we spent billion  received insurance recoveries of million  and purchased short term investments of million and redeemed short term investments of million 
capital expenditures 
our capital spending of billion for increased from our billion of capital spending during these amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of million in and million in of the billion spent in  we invested billion in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in acquisitions and domestic leasehold activity including million for the rocky mountain asset acquisition and million internationally 
our capital spending of billion increased from our capital spending of billion 
these amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of million in and million in during  we invested billion in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in other domestic leasehold activity and million internationally 
we budgeted billion for capital spending in  excluding acquisitions and million of estimated capitalized interest and overhead 
approximately of the billion is allocated to the mid continent  to the rocky mountains  to the onshore gulf coast  to the gulf of mexico and to international projects 
see item  business our properties and plans for since our capital budget currently exceeds forecasted net cash flow from operations  we plan to make up the shortfall with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including the extent to which properties are acquired  drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services 
we continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
depending on the timing of an acquisition  we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flow used in financing activities both continuing and discontinued for was million compared to million of net cash flow provided by financing activities for during  we borrowed and repaid billion under our credit arrangements  repaid million principal amount of our senior notes at their maturity in october  received proceeds of million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  and received a million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
during  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  used the proceeds from the notes to redeem million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  borrowed and repaid million under our credit arrangements  received proceeds of million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  and received a million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options

we have work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other cash commitments 
at december   these work related commitments totaled million and were comprised of million in the united states and million internationally 
these amounts are not included by maturity because their timing cannot be accurately predicted 

table of contents credit arrangements 
please see liquidity and capital resources credit arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit 
senior notes 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually 
the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations 
we may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things incur debt secured by liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and enter into merger or consolidation transactions 
the indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future  then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note  debt interest rate swaps  to our consolidated financial statements 
senior subordinated notes 
in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness 
we may redeem some or all of our notes due at any time on or after september  and some or all of our notes due at any time on or after april   in each case  at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes 
we also may redeem all but not part of our notes due prior to september  and all but not part of our notes due prior to april   in each case  at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in addition  before april   we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of our notes due with net cash proceeds from certain sales of our common stock at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  make restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  create liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets 

table of contents commitments under joint operating agreements 
most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
oil and gas hedging as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
approximately of our production was subject to derivative contracts including basis contracts 
in  of our production was subject to derivative contracts  compared to in while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
historically  a majority of our hedged natural gas and crude oil production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges 
with the sale of the gulf of mexico shelf production and the corresponding shift in the geographic distribution of our natural gas production  we have begun to utilize basis hedges to a greater extent 
the price that we receive for natural gas production from the gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically averages less per mmbtu than the henry hub index 
realized gas prices for our mid continent properties  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically average of the henry hub index 
in light of potential basis risk with respect to our newly acquired rocky mountain assets  we have hedged the basis differential for about of our estimated production from proved producing fields acquired from stone energy through to lock in the differential at a weighted average of per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
the price we receive for our gulf coast oil production typically averages about per barrel below the nymex west texas intermediate wti price 
the price we receive for our oil production in the rocky mountains is currently averaging about per barrel below the wti price 
oil production from the mid continent typically sells at a per barrel discount to wti 
oil sales from our operations in malaysia typically sell at tapis  which generally is consistent with wti 
oil sales from our operations in china typically sell at per barrel less than wti 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
at december   barclays capital  jpmorgan chase  citibank na  j aron company  bank of montreal and credit suisse were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production 
between january  and february   we entered into the additional derivative contracts set forth below 
none of these contracts have been designated for hedge accounting

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting 
table of contents policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions 
stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards  the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments 
oil and gas activities 
accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change 
table of contents substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of dd a expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for would have required a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at december  of approximately bcfe 
due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools for malaysia and china  any decrease in reserves associated with the respective country s full cost pool would significantly increase the dd a rate in that country 
however  since production from our international operations represented only about of our consolidated production for  a change in our international dd a expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting 
given the fluctuation of natural gas and oil prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
at december   the ceiling value of our domestic oil and gas reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mmbtu for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
using these prices  the ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties by approximately billion net of tax at december  at december   the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in malaysia and china exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties by approximately million and million  respectively 
holding all other factors constant  if the applicable index for oil prices were to decline to approximately per bbl  it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in malaysia 
it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in china if the applicable index for oil prices were to decline to approximately per bbl  holding all other factors constant 
costs withheld from amortization 
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment 
table of contents requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   our domestic full cost pool had approximately billion of costs excluded from the amortization base 
because the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties  inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base  without adding any associated reserves  would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
however  our future dd a rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates 
the accounting for future abandonment costs is set forth by sfas no 
this standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future development and abandonment costs at december  of approximately million 
due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in malaysia and china  a change greater than million and million  respectively  in future development or abandonment costs associated with the respective country s full cost pool would increase the dd a rate in that country by 
however  since production from our international operations represented only about of our consolidated production for  a change in our international dd a expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations 
as part of our growth strategy  we actively pursue acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair 
table of contents value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 
the accounting for business combinations will change in please see new accounting standards below for a detailed discussion 
goodwill of each reporting unit each country is a separate reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in making this assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated cash flows 
as there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
if it is overstated  such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
we elected to make december our annual assessment date 
commodity derivative activities 
we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next months 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
under accounting rules  we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production 
to the extent that changes in the fair values of the cash flow hedges offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production  such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
to the extent that changes in the fair values of the derivative exceed the changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production  the changes are recorded in income in the period in which they occur 
derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the changes occur 
beginning on october   we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts  we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent  third party quotations

regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
an overview of this regulation is set forth below 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
please see the discussion under the caption we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business in item a of this report 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
our sales of natural gas are affected directly or indirectly by the availability  terms and cost of natural gas transportation 
the prices and terms for access to pipeline transportation of natural gas are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the natural gas act nga and by regulations and orders promulgated under the nga by the ferc 
in certain limited circumstances  intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by congress and by ferc regulations 

table of contents the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access  non discriminatory service 
there are currently no regulations implemented by the ferc under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
therefore  we do not believe that any ferc or mms action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it will affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
on august   president bush signed into law the energy policy act of epa 
this comprehensive act contains many provisions that will encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the us the epa directs the ferc  mms and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the epa 
the epa also increased civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the nga  the natural gas policy act of  and any rules  regulations or orders of the ferc up to million per day per violation 
the ferc issued a final rule effective january  that makes it unlawful for any entity  in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation service subject to the ferc s jurisdiction  to defraud  make an untrue statement or omit a material fact or engage in any practice  act or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud 
these changes resulting from the epa have significantly expanded and strengthened oversight of natural gas markets 
we believe  however  that neither the epa nor the regulations promulgated  or to be promulgated  as a result of the epa will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
the current statutory and regulatory framework governing interstate natural gas transactions is subject to change in the future  and the nature of such changes is impossible to predict 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
in the past  the federal government regulated the prices at which gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  there is always some risk  however  that congress may reenact price controls in the future 
changes in law and to ferc policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines  and we cannot predict what future action the ferc will take 
we do not believe  however  that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other crude oil and condensate producers 
federal leases 
our oil and gas leases in the gulf of mexico and many of our leases in the rocky mountains are granted by the federal government and administered by the mms or the blm  both federal agencies 
mms and blm leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm or mms regulations and  in the case of offshore leases  orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling  and comply with regulations governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of wells on the shelf and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees 
table of contents have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the blm or the mms  as applicable  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
the epa formalizes the royalty in kind program of the mms  providing that the mms may take royalties in kind if the secretary of the interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value 
we believe that the mms s royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in  the mms amended its regulations to require additional filing fees 
the mms has estimated that these additional filing fees will represent less than of the revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases 
we do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore in a number of states and in state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
please see the table under acreage data in item of this report 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials  the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states have the power to prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the cost of compliance could be significant 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations  or the issuance of injunctive relief including orders to cease operations 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we also are subject to various environmental permit requirements 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
moreover  some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability  which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns strict  joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by 
table of contents opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires operators in the gulf of mexico to demonstrate to the mms that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
under opa and implementing mms regulations  responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least million for an oil spill in state waters and at least million for an oil spill in federal waters 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
the cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with the cwa  including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
the opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention  control and countermeasure or spcc plans 
we have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or  as necessary  developing new spcc plans that will satisfy new spcc plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in july ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  the us environmental protection agency  also known as the epa  and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws and common law obligations  and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties  including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
the clean air act caa and comparable state statutes restrict the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations 
new facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
also  the epa has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants 
these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

table of contents the occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
the osha hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees 
other osha standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations 
failure to comply with osha requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties 
international regulations 
our exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations similar to those described above imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate  and may affect our operations and costs within that country 
we currently have operations in malaysia and china 
forward looking information this report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures  future drilling plans and programs  expected production rates  the availability and source of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves  our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that these expectations are reasonable  this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties 
actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services  the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil we produce from our monument butte field  the availability of capital resources  labor conditions  severe weather conditions such as hurricanes  and the other factors affecting our business described above under the caption risk factors

an agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage 
generally  the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage 
the assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease 
the interest received by an assignee is a farm in  while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out

gross acres or gross wells 
the total acres or wells in which we own a working interest 
infill drilling or infill well 
a well drilled between known producing wells to improve oil and natural gas reserve recovery efficiency 
mbbls 
one thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mcf 
one thousand cubic feet

mmbbls 
one million barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mmbtu 
one million btus 
net acres or net wells 
the sum of the fractional working interests we own in gross acres or gross wells  as the case may be 
nymex 
the new york mercantile exchange 
probable reserves 
reserves which analysis of drilling  geological  geophysical and engineering data does not demonstrate to be proved under current technology and existing economic conditions  but where such analysis suggests the likelihood of their existence and future recovery 

table of contents productive well 
a well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes 
promoted drilling 
an agreement where under the owner of this type of interest in the drilling of a well incurs a disproportionate share of costs associated with the well until the well is drilled and completed 
proved developed producing reserves 
proved developed reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals currently open in existing wells and capable of production to market 
proved developed reserves 
in general  proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
the sec provides a complete definition of proved developed reserves in rule a of regulation s x 
proved developed nonproducing reserves 
proved developed reserves expected to be recovered from zones behind casing in existing wells 
proved reserves 
in general  the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the sec provides a complete definition of proved reserves in rule a of regulation s x 
proved undeveloped reserves 
in general  proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
the sec provides a complete definition of proved undeveloped reserves in rule a of regulation s x 
reserve life index 
this index is calculated by dividing total proved reserves at year end by annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining production 
shelf 
the us outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
water depths generally range from feet to  feet 
tcfe 
one trillion cubic feet equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate 
unconventional resource plays 
plays targeting tight sand  coal bed or gas shale reservoirs 
the reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps  seals and discrete hydrocarbon water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs 
these reservoirs generally require stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economically 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
waterflood 
a secondary recovery operation in which water is injected into the producing formation in order to maintain reservoir pressure and force oil toward and into the producing wells 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production 
workover 
operations on a producing well to restore or increase production

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we use hedging to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
interest rates at december   our debt was comprised of fixed variable rate debt rate debt in millions bank revolving credit facility senior notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due total current and long term debt million principal amount of our senior notes due is subject to interest rate swaps 
these swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments  and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because a substantial majority  about  of our long term debt obligations  after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements  were at fixed rates 
foreign currency exchange rates the functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the us dollar 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
