we are a global designer and manufacturer of custom engineered ejectors  liquid ring pump packages  condensers and heat exchangers 
our equipment is used in critical applications in the petrochemical  oil refinery and electric power generation industries  including cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in diverse applications  such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  soap manufacturing  food processing  pharmaceuticals  heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
our corporate offices and production facilities are located in batavia  new york 
additionally  we have a wholly owned foreign subsidiary located in suzhou  china 
our subsidiary in china serves to support sales orders from asia and provides engineering support and supervision of subcontracted fabrication 
we believe the principal market drivers that have led to increased capital spending by our customers and that are contributing to our sales growth include global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next decade 
there is a shortage of global oil refining capacity  which is being addressed through refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
known supplies of sweet crude oil are being depleted 
sour crude sources are identified and believed to be plentiful 
there is a differential in raw material prices for sweet and sour crude oil 
to lower production costs  many refineries are upgrading facilities in order to be able to process sour crude oil  which requires an upgrade of vacuum and heat transfer equipment of the types we design and manufacture 
expanding middle class in asia is driving increasing demand for power  refinery and petrochemical products 
the high cost of natural gas in north america and europe is leading to the construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east  where natural gas is plentiful and less expensive 

table of contents there is an increased need in certain regions for geothermal electrical power plants to meet increased electricity demand 
refineries in the united states are being upgraded to process synthetic crude oil from the alberta oil sands region of canada 
looking ahead to fiscal  we believe the global refinery and petrochemical markets we serve will continue to be strong and could remain strong for the next several years 
refinery capacity continues to expand worldwide with an estimated increase of three to four billion barrels per annum in the next three to five years being necessary to keep up with projected demand 
for example  the number of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold in china over the next four years is estimated to increase fifty percent 
refinery utilization rates are estimated to be at their highest levels in twenty five years 
we anticipate demand for energy and petrochemical products abroad will continue for the next several years because countries with large populations  such as china and india  are experiencing significant economic growth at the same time drivers such as environmental regulations  change in crude supplies and development of alternative energy sources are affecting both the supply and demand of energy and petrochemical products 
looking beyond the current super cycle  we believe there will be growth potential in emerging market opportunities  such as coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  ethanol and waste to energy  which may offer both top and bottom line growth in our future 
in addition to growing revenue from major project work  we believe we can continue to grow our heat exchanger and aftermarket businesses

table of contents results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share identifiable assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with sales of  for fiscal ninety two percent of the increase in sales in fiscal compared with fiscal came from ejector and spare part sales  which were primarily sold to the refinery market 
of the  related to ejectors and the balance related to spare parts 
export sales accounted for and of total sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
export sales year over year increased  or 
the increase in export sales came from asia  south america and canada 
sales for fiscal were to the refining industry  to the chemical and petrochemical industries and to other industrial applications  including electrical power 
sales in fiscal were to the refining industry  to the chemical and petrochemical industries and to other industrial applications  including electrical power 
we divide our products into five broadly defined classifications ejectors  condensers  aftermarket  heat exchangers and pump packages 
sales for these categories in fiscal were    and  respectively 
for fiscal sales  by the same respective categories  were    and 
these sales changes by product categories reflect the timing of orders placed with us and are not indicative of buying pattern changes in the markets we serve 
for additional information on future sales and our markets  see orders and backlog below 
our gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit dollars for fiscal increased compared with fiscal gross profit percentage and dollars increased primarily due to improved product mix achieved by increased selectivity on orders accepted  improved engineering and manufacturing efficiencies and greater leveraging of manufacturing costs 
our improved operating efficiencies enabled us to achieve greater sales volume in fiscal without increasing proportionally our cost of products sold 
we believe we will continue to increase capacity through outsourcing and improving operating efficiencies  and that these efforts will contribute to sales growth in fiscal and beyond 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal and were and of sales  respectively 
the decline  expressed as a percentage of sales  was due to greater sales in fiscal actual costs in fiscal increased  or  compared with fiscal sg a expenses increased due to greater variable costs eg  sales commissions  variable compensation related to higher sales and net income 
interest income for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
increased interest income followed increases in investments of 
interest expense was in both fiscal and our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was less than the statutory rate of approximately due to the qualified production activities deduction and research and development tax credit r d 
we anticipate the effective tax rate for fiscal will be 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflected the benefit of  in research and development tax credits 
the total credit recognized represented qualifying r d expenditures for fiscal years 
table of contents to the r d tax credit recognized in fiscal was and represented the approximate magnitude of the amount of credit that we expect under current r d tax law going forward 
net income for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
income per diluted share was and for the respective periods 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with  for fiscal fifty two percent of this increase came from greater export sales 
the growth in export sales primarily came from the middle east and asia  and involved both petrochemical and refinery projects 
sales in all product categories eg  heat exchangers  ejectors  condensers  vacuum pumps and aftermarket increased compared with fiscal  but the greatest dollar value increases came from sales of ejectors  heat exchangers and vacuum pumps 
our heat exchanger products are heliflows  plate exchangers  desuperheaters and water heaters 
increased heat exchanger sales accounted for of the increased sales 
heat exchanger sales in fiscal were led upward by heliflows and plate exchanger sales 
heat exchanger sales grew due to a broad based strategic effort  which included training  changing the supplier who provided the basic materials used to build plate exchangers  manufacturing efficiencies gained through the implementation of lean procedures  the introduction of software marketing tools and the addition of an expanded agency network 
increased ejector sales in fiscal accounted for of the increased sales and were due to increased activity from the refinery industry for oil refinery upgrades and capacity expansion projects 
increased vacuum pump sales accounted for of the increased sales and came from domestic refinery applications 
the remaining increase in sales  compared with fiscal  came from single digit gains in the other products we sell 
our gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit percentage decreased primarily due to greater material costs in fiscal material costs  expressed as a percent of sales  were and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as a result of greater sales volume 
sg a expenses for fiscal were of sales compared to for fiscal the decline  expressed as a percentage of sales  was due to greater sales in fiscal actual costs increased in fiscal or compared with fiscal sg a expense increased in fiscal due to the additional costs of operating our chinese subsidiary  which was formed in may interest income for fiscal and was and  respectively 
increased interest income in fiscal followed increases in investments 
investments were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense was for fiscal compared with for fiscal interest expense decreased due to reduced debt and a reduction in the applicable interest rate under our banking facility on a year over year basis 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the fiscal rate approximated the statutory rate 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflected the benefit of  in r d tax credits 
the total credit recognized in fiscal represented qualifying expenditures for fiscal years to net income for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
income per diluted share was and for the respective periods 
stockholders equity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity fiscal fiscal fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal eighty four percent of this increase was due to the increase in net income  was due to stock options exercised  and was for all other reasons 
in october  we increased our dividend per share from cents per share per annum to cents 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  or  due to this increase and due to additional shares outstanding 
it is our objective to continue to increase stockholders value by taking steps to increase the liquidity of our common stock  which could include additional stock splits when and if we believe it is in the company s best interest to do so and depending on market conditions 
on march   our net book value was  up over march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this pronouncement required  as of march   that we measure the prepaid assets and liabilities appearing on our balance sheet pertaining to our defined benefit postretirement plans under the projected benefit obligation method and adjust asset and or liability valuation changes through accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
the net effect of this accounting change was a reduction in stockholders equity of  offsetting this reduction was net income for fiscal of  these two items accounted for of the change in stockholders equity in fiscal compared with fiscal as of march   our net book value per share increased to  up from march  liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets march  working capital working capital ratio long term debt capital leases long term debt capitalization long term liabilities capitalization working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
long term debt capitalization equals long term debt divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt 
long term liabilities capitalization equals total liabilities minus current liabilities divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt 

table of contents as of march   contractual and commercial obligations for the next five fiscal years ending march and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases pension and postretirement benefits accrued compensation accrued pension liability total for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal to our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february   we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged for fiscal we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
the contribution to our defined benefit pension plan for fiscal is estimated to be  fiscal compared with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal the increase was due to higher net income  greater utilization of deferred tax assets thereby reducing cash needed to pay taxes in the current fiscal year and operating the business with less operating working capital 
operating working capital was lower due to continued reduction in our cash conversion cycle  which was days as of march  compared with days as of march  the decrease in our cash conversion cycle was accomplished through reducing accounts receivable and inventory balances during fiscal sales in fiscal were managed with an average operating working capital level of of sales compared with in fiscal we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in marketable securities 
investments are united states government instruments  generally with maturity periods of to days 
investments at march  and march  were  and  respectively 
other significant sources of cash for the current year included the issuance of common stock to cover stock options exercised  which raised  as compared with in fiscal in addition  in fiscal we recognized a  increase in capital in excess of par value for the income tax benefit realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of the tax benefit amount recognized pertaining to the fair value of stock option awards treated as compensation expense  compared with for fiscal all other sources of cash in fiscal equaled compared with in fiscal other significant uses of cash for fiscal included dividend payments of and capital expenditures of  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal in fiscal  we contributed  into our defined benefit pension plan  compared with  for fiscal in fiscal  we repaid in excess of amounts borrowed for bank borrowings and capitalized leases  as compared with for fiscal all other uses of cash in fiscal equaled compared with in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and was for all other 
fifty six percent of our capital expenditure spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be  and planned investment is believed to be about for machinery and equipment  for information technology and for all other 
we estimate of our capital budget in fiscal will support productivity improvements with the balance primarily for capitalized maintenance projects 

table of contents on december   we entered into a new revolving credit facility with bank of america  na that provides a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
borrowings under our bank facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
other utilization of our facility limits at march  and were our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate minus basis points  or 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
the new revolving credit agreement includes several changes compared with our former credit facility  including an increase in the facility capacity limit from  a maximum annual dividend payout of  compared with  elimination of facility sub limits for borrowings  the issuance of letters of credit or the issuance of bank guarantees on the obligations of our chinese subsidiary by bank of america s shanghai china branch  expanded use of borrowings  and a reduction in pricing 
under the new revolving credit agreement  we covenanted to maintain a ratio of total liabilities  excluding non current portion of subordinated liabilities  to tangible net worth not to exceed to we are in compliance with this covenant 
orders and backlog orders for fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  up 
orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
we experienced a significant increase in orders for surface condensers  vacuum pump package and aftermarket orders in fiscal compared with fiscal surface condenser orders represented of our orders  vacuum pump packages and aftermarket of our orders for the current fiscal year compared with  and for surface condenser  vacuum pump package and aftermarket orders  respectively  in fiscal in dollars  year over year surface condensers  vacuum pump package and aftermarket orders grew   and  respectively for fiscal  and condenser orders for refinery and petrochemical applications in the middle east  canada and china  vacuum pump package orders for domestic refinery capacity expansion and aftermarket orders for capitalized maintenance projects in the domestic refinery sector accounted for the increases 
domestic orders were  or  of our total orders and export orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal compared with fiscal  when domestic orders were  or  of our total orders and export orders were  or  excluding our heat exchanger business  which represented approximately of our domestic orders  our domestic orders were heavily weighted for refinery orders and were attributed to refinery capacity expansion  revamping of refineries to process heavier feed stocks  and requirements to meet cleaner fuel standards 
while overall export orders were down in fiscal due to order selection criteria  export refinery orders from china  south america and canada were up in fiscal compared with fiscal orders from canada and south america were driven by greater use of unconventional fuels eg  heavy oil  high viscosity  and tar sands 
china orders were for capacity expansion projects 
new petrochemical business was driven largely from the global need to increase capacity and the expansion of emerging alternative energy technologies 
backlog was  at march  compared with  at march   a increase 
backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately of orders currently in backlog is not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the 
table of contents plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   other than noted above  we were unaware of any other pending litigation matters 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred to a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized when probable 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
for more information on these matters see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize the substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal is for our defined benefit pension and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would increase fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would increase fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of with this annual report on form k related to contingencies  revenue  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed is foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales compared with for fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of the fiscal years  and  we had no sales for which we were paid in foreign currencies 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in  and  our purchases in foreign currencies represented  and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in or  and as of march  and  we held no forward foreign currency contracts
