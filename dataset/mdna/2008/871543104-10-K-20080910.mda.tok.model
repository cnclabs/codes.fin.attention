our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the sunday closest to june fiscal years through were week fiscal years 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we integrated our quality of experience assurance business segment into our telecom solutions division 
in addition  during fiscal  we recorded an impairment of million in goodwill and million in intangibles for the quality of experience assurance business segment 
on june   we offered to purchase for cash  on a pro rata basis  approximately million aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due the notes  at a purchase price equal to per  of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on july   pursuant to the offer  symmetricom accepted for payment million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the aggregate purchase price for the notes surrendered was approximately million  which includes interest of million 
after the purchase pursuant to the offer  approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates due to their subjective nature and judgments involved in each business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  and the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
however  for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an amount of revenue equal to our estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense when orders are shipped  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method cost to cost basis  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as a performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the income from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
in july  symmetricom puerto rico  a wholly owned subsidiary  moved its place of legal organization from delaware to bermuda in a transaction intended to be a tax free restructuring 
we submitted a ruling request to the internal revenue service to confirm the tax free treatment in february ruling requests of this nature are considered routine and management believes that it is probable that the ruling will be granted 
if the ruling is granted  symmetricom puerto rico would be treated as a branch of symmetricom  inc effective as of july and  accordingly  the profits of symmetricom puerto rico would be currently taxable for federal income tax purposes 
if granted  the ruling would result in no changes to our tax provision as reported in our fiscal years and annual reports 
if the ruling is not granted  then we would be required to take a one time  non cash charge to our deferred tax assets of approximately million related to the july restructuring transaction with respect to our fiscal year  symmetricom puerto rico would continue its election to indefinitely reinvest its future earnings outside of the united states and not repatriate future earnings back to symmetricom  inc  our fiscal year tax provision would be reduced by million while our deferred tax assets would increase by approximately the same amount  and our fiscal year tax provision would be reduced by million while our deferred tax assets would increase by approximately the same amount 
the above three items would be reported in the fiscal year and quarter in which the request for irs confirmation of tax free treatment of the july restructuring was denied 
the net result of such a denial would be an increased tax provision of approximately million while our deferred tax assets would decrease by approximately the same amount 
prior to fiscal  symmetricom puerto rico had elected to report its us taxes under section of the united state internal revenue code 
this election exempted qualified puerto rico earnings from regular federal income taxes  subject to various limitations 
section expired at the end of fiscal the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and has a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
on july   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
short term investments short term investments consist of government securities  mutual funds and corporate debt securities that mature between three and months 
all of our short term investments are classified as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair value with temporary unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity 
short term investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we consult with our investment manager and consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
during fiscal  we recorded million in losses related to short term investments 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below for additional information regarding this loss and our determination of the fair value of these investments at june   and related subsequent events 
valuation of goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal  as a result of our annual impairment test  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million for the full write down of the goodwill million and intangible assets million recorded in connection with the acquisition in january of qosmetrics sa and the acquisition of certain technology assets in june from genista corporation  which were integrated with the company s quality of experience assurance business segment 
the impairment charge reflects a change in business expectations which include lower than expected market acceptance for the quality of experience assurance products 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a review of its quality of experience assurance business model  resulting in the elimination of a separate quality of experience assurance division and its integration with the telecom solutions division 
subsequent to this review  during our annual impairment test  we determined that the carrying amount of our quality of experience assurance reporting unit exceeded its fair value  resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined the fair value of the quality of experience assurance reporting unit using the income approach  which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using an estimated discount rate 
our estimates resulted from an updated long term financial outlook for this reporting unit as of the fourth quarter of fiscal valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
we review our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of our annual impairment test of goodwill see above valuation of goodwill and using a non discounted cash flow method  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million for the write down of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition in january of qosmetrics sa and the acquisition of certain technology assets in june from genista corporation  which were integrated with the company s quality of experience assurance business segment 
fiscal year outlook during fiscal year  revenue for two large customers which each comprise more than of our revenue was lower than the prior year in which these customers began an upgrade cycle to replace their legacy equipment 
revenue for fiscal year from these two customers may not increase or continue at the fiscal year level 
we anticipate that in fiscal our cable business within the wireline products segment will become a greater percentage of total revenue compared to fiscal we expect fluctuations in quarterly revenue  as the upgrade projects undertaken by our customers are not systematic 
we anticipate that gross margin in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of increased outsourcing to china  favorable product sales mix and lower period costs 
we expect the pace of operating expense growth for fiscal year to be consistent with the prior year due to reduced spending levels in our quality of experience assurance business segment  which we combined with our telecom solutions division during fiscal  and lower research and development expenses due to the elimination of our austin  texas facility 
we expect revenues for fiscal year to be between million and million and earnings to be between and per share  on a fully diluted basis 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect revenues to be between million and million and earnings to be in the range of to cents per share

we also incurred higher costs for restructuring due to a reduction in force in our puerto rico manufacturing plant as a result of outsourcing production of some products to china 
we anticipate a decline in other cost of sales for fiscal due to the impairment of intangible assets for the quality of experience assurance segment taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which will result in lower amortization costs going forward 
year ended june  july  change change research and development expense dollars in thousands percentage of revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  prototype expenses and fees paid to outside consultants 
the million increase in research and development expense included million which was attributable to the full year impact of the january  acquisition of qosmetrics sa and the formation of the quality of experience assurance segment  as well as the october  acquisition of timing solutions corporation tsc

these metrics  which compare fiscal year with fiscal year  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of july  our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of june   compared to million as of july  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of june   we had approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of july  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million  compared to million as of july  cash and cash equivalents as of june  increased million to million from million as of july  this increase was primarily the result of a shift from short term investments to cash and cash equivalents 
as a result  short term investments decreased from million as of july  to million as of june  the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was impacted by the following factors net loss of million offset by impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million related to the quality of experience assurance business segment  non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in deferred income tax and million decrease in accounts payable 
the million net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in maturities of short term investments 
this was partially offset by million in purchases of short term investments 
the million net cash used for financing activities was primarily attributable to million used to repurchase common stock and million to repay long term obligations 
our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of june  were approximately million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   unchanged from july  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
as a result of our delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended december   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities and exchange act of for a period of twelve calendar months and any portion of a month from the due date of the last untimely report 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
other than temporary impairment on investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased asset backed commercial paper with a million par value maturing on march   and classified this as a short term investment 
at the time of purchase  the investment s portfolio consisted primarily of triple a rated assets  with sub prime loan assets making up approximately of the investment 
subsequently  the structured investment vehicle siv issuing the commercial paper was declared insolvent and entered receivership 
on january   our investment manager advised us that the fair value of this investment had declined  and that an impairment loss should be considered other than temporary based on discussions with the receiver and potential options expected to be made available to senior debt holders of which symmetricom was one 
our investment manager determined the fair value of the investment using pricing levels of the underlying portfolio by three different broker dealers 
management then made an independent valuation assessment of similar securities using the abx index which is an index to track the performance of mortgage backed securities  to confirm that the valuation results from our investment manager were reasonable 
based on this assessment of fair value  symmetricom recognized a loss of million related to this investment during fiscal year after the receivers sold the siv to an investment bank  we received a cash distribution of million  relating to the cash portion of the fund  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the investment bank offered investors the option of cashing out of the fund or reinvesting in a new investment vehicle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments are mainly in corporate debt securities that have maturity dates of greater than three months 
these corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
the possibility exists that some of these issues may be downgraded as a result of disruptions in the credit market  however  we believe that we currently have the ability and currently intend to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
on june   we issued convertible subordinated notes with a fixed rate of  which have no interest rate risk impact to our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business in various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
