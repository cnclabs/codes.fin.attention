item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein 
important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward looking statements in this annual report 
in assessing forward looking statements contained herein  readers are urged to read carefully all risk factors and cautionary statements contained in this annual report 
further  we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
overview we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases 
our primary focus is the development and commercialization of drug candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents vdas that selectively disrupt abnormal blood vessels associated with solid tumor progression and visual impairment  which are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth 
because our vda product candidates act via a well validated therapeutic mechanism  inhibition of blood flow to tumors and neovascular lesions within the eye  we believe the risk associated with our drug development programs is lower than that of many other agents that act via unvalidated therapeutic mechanisms 
our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  zybrestat tm  is currently being evaluated in a phase ii iii pivotal registration study as a potential treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer  a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options 
in addition  zybrestat is being evaluated in phase ib and ii clinical trials  in combination with established cancer treatment modalities  as a potential treatment for other solid tumors  including non small cell lung cancer nsclc  platinum resistant ovarian cancer  and head and neck cancer 
based upon preclinical results first published by our collaborators in the november online issue of the journal blood  we believe that zybrestat and our other vda product candidates may also have utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies or liquid tumors 
in addition to developing zybrestat as an intravenously administered therapy for cancer indications  we are developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological diseases and conditions  such as age related macular degeneration that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that results in loss of vision 
we believe that a safe  effective convenient and topically administered anti vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti vascular  ophthalmological therapeutics  which must be injected directly into patients eyes on a frequent basis 
we currently anticipate initiating in human clinical studies with a topical formulation of zybrestat in an ophthalmological indication 
we are currently evaluating a second generation vda product candidate  oxi  in a phase clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we refer to oxi as an ortho quinone prodrug 
in preclinical studies  oxi has shown potent anti tumor activity  both as a single agent  and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities 
we believe that oxi is differentiated from other vdas by its ability to exert i potent vascular disrupting effects on tumor vasculature  and ii direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells in a tumor preferential fashion 
finally  under a sponsored research agreement with baylor university  we are pursuing discovery and development of novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer that we believe will be complementary with our later stage vda product candidates 

table of contents financial resources we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception through december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we primarily invest in commercial paper  investment grade corporate bonds  asset backed securities and money market funds 
our investment objectives are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
as of december   the weighted average days to maturity of our available for sale marketable securities was approximately days  and the yield to maturity based on the cost of those investments was approximately 
we expect that income from these investments may decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an expected lower average balance of invested funds and a lower average yield 
in june  we completed a private placement with three large institutional investors 
we received approximately  in net proceeds after deducting costs and expenses 
the investors purchased  shares of our common stock at per share and were issued two year warrants which expired in to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in addition to the cash offering costs of  the placement agent in the offering was issued five year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares at per share  which expire in june in january  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission in october  allowing us to sell up to  of our common stock  debt securities and or warrants to purchase our securities 
in march  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to the shelf registration statement referred to above 
in december  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission in september  allowing us to sell up to  of our common stock  debt securities and or warrants to purchase our securities 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of our common stock or up to an aggregate of  during the next three years 
under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  for a period of five years thereafter 

table of contents the actual and planned uses of proceeds from all of the above financings include the continued development of our two lead compounds  zybrestat and oxi  in oncology and ophthalmology 
we expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider collaborative development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own as well as program structured financing facilities  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
available for sale securities we view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations  and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired  due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery  with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long term assets 
accrued clinical costs we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
currently  greater than of our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in our contracts with them 
costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
we review this asset for impairment if indicators of impairment are present using an undiscounted net cash flows approach  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  an impairment is to be recognized in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
differences in estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets could result in impairment charges  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
to date  we have not recorded any impairment in this recorded asset since our initial capitalization 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the estimated fair value associated with such awards was not recorded as an expense  but rather was disclosed in a footnote to our financial statements 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes pricing model  which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term stock option exercise price and grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of option plan participants over time 
expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the options granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 

table of contents of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
the majority of the stock option expense recorded in fiscal relates to continued vesting of stock options and restricted stock that were granted prior to january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards  which were also calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
this requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to january  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate 
in our calculation  we segregated participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the forfeiture rate from to for the directors and officers group 
the adjustment was based on review of historical data of actual forfeiture experience of this group 
this resulted in a reduction to stock based compensation of  in fiscal for retroactively increasing the forfeiture rate from to 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
changes in the inputs and assumptions  as described above  can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
revised  entitled business combinations 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas r is effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf entitled accounting for collaborative arrangements 
eitf defines collaboration arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf entitled accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for future research and development activities 
this issue provides guidance on whether nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payment is made or when the research and development activity has been performed 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into after january  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 entitled fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement is an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 entitled fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues during the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in licensing revenue in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology 
we did not recognize any licensing revenue during the year ended december  future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to be minimal 
our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to  and generate revenues from products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in fiscal unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up front payments 
costs and expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses of total of total operating operating increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount research and development general and administrative total operating expenses we expect that as we continue to develop our two lead potential product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  the percentage of research and development expenses to total operating expenses will continue to increase 
research and development expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of total of total increase operating operating decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount external services employee compensation and related stock based compensation other total research and development 
table of contents external services expenses are comprised of costs incurred for consultants  contractors and outside service providers that assist in the management and support of our development programs 
the increase in these costs in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to the further development of our two primary potential product candidates  zybrestat in both oncology and ophthalmology and oxi in oncology 
in particular  in june  we initiated our phase ii iii trial of zybrestat in the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer  a multi center  patient clinical trial 
this is the largest clinical trial we have undertaken to date 
in addition  we initiated a clinical trial of zybrestat in combination with bevacizumab avastin in late november  and such trial was ongoing for all of fiscal decreases in both employee compensation and related expenses as well as stock based compensation expense is attributable to a decrease in the average number of employees in fiscal over fiscal we expect that with the continued development of our two lead candidates  zybrestat and oxi in oncology and ophthalmology  as well as our discovery efforts for novel compounds  our research and development expenses will continue to increase 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of external services expenses to total research and development expenses will continue to increase as well 
general and administrative expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of total of total operating operating increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount employee compensation and related stock based compensation consulting and professional services facilities related other total general and administrative approximately of the overall increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to employee compensation and related expenses and stock based compensation 
although the average number of employees decreased from to  the increase in such expense is due to payments and awards made in in accordance with executive employment agreements and the addition of a senior level executive in  as we continue to build and develop our administrative capabilities to appropriately support our development programs 
the increase in consulting and professional services expense is due to additional advisory services as we support the continued advancement of our development programs 
the increase in facilities related expense is due to the establishment of office space in the san francisco area in we expect that we will continue to incur general and administrative expenses at an appropriate level to support the ongoing development of our potential product candidates and to meet the requirements of being a public company 
other income and expenses investment income decreased by approximately  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during the respective periods offset in part by higher average interest rates and returns on investments 

table of contents tax matters as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for us income tax purposes  which expire through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of these loss carry forwards  we have fully reserved this future benefit 
additionally  the future utilization of the us net operating loss carry forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
the valuation allowance increased by approximately  and approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively  due primarily to the increase in net operating loss carry forwards 
years ended december  and revenues we did not recognize any licensing revenue during the fiscal year ended december  and recognized licensing revenue of approximately  during the fiscal year ended december  these amounts were received in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology 
costs and expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses of total of total operating operating increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of total of total operating operating increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount external services employee compensation and related stock based compensation other total research and development increases in both employee compensation and related expenses and external services related expenses in fiscal account for of the increase in research and development expenses overall 
the increase in employee compensation and related costs is attributable to both a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal and an increase in the average number of employees in fiscal over fiscal of approximately 
the purpose of the restructuring was primarily to streamline our clinical development operations in order to improve the effectiveness of efforts to develop our potential product candidates 

table of contents external services expenses are comprised of costs incurred for consultants and contractors that assist in the management and support of our development programs 
the increase in these costs in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to the further development of our two primary potential product candidates  zybrestat in both oncology and ophthalmology and oxi in oncology 
the increase in stock based compensation expense is attributable to the adoption of sfas r in requiring the recognition of an expense for all stock based compensation awards 
general and administrative expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of total of total operating operating increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount employee compensation and related stock based compensation consulting and professional services facilities related other total general and administrative the single largest increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal related to stock based compensation 
this increase was due to our adoption of sfas r in as well as recognition of a full year of expense for restricted stock granted in the fourth quarter of sfas r requires the recognition of an expense for all stock based compensation awards 
the increase in employee compensation and related expenses is attributable to costs of approximately  in the second quarter of in connection with a change in senior management and an increase in average number of employees of approximately in fiscal over fiscal this was offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services costs primarily in connection with market analysis work performed in fiscal and not repeated in fiscal other income and expenses investment income increased by approximately  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher average interest rates and returns on investments and  to a lesser extent  higher average cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during the respective periods 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financing 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception  except in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur increased expenses  resulting in losses  over at least the next several years due to  among other factors  our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities 
we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately  at december  
table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated  in thousands years ended december  operating activities net loss non cash adjustments to net loss changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities investing activities net increase decrease in available for sale securities purchase of furniture  fixtures and equipment other net cash provided by used in investing activities financing activities proceeds from issuance of common stock other net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year approximately or  of the non cash adjustments to net loss relates to compensation expense from the issuance of options and restricted stock 
changes in operating assets for fiscal include an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  in february  we entered into the ceff with kingsbridge  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of our common stock or up to an aggregate of  during the next three years 
under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement whichever less  is subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of a draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  and for a period of five years thereafter 
we are required to file a registration statement in order to register the resale by kingsbridge of the shares issuable to kingsbridge under the ceff within days of february  our anticipated cash requirement for fiscal is expected to be between  and  our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our potential product development programs  particularly the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials  much of which is not within our control as well as the timing of hiring development staff to support our product development plans 
we expect to augment our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as of december  of  with the utilization of our newly implemented ceff as well as through other forms of capital infusion 
with such resources we expect to satisfy our cash requirements at least through the first quarter of fiscal our primary anticipated uses of funds during the fiscal year involve the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates under development 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned for or anticipated by management due to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these 
table of contents risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the progress of and results of our pre clinical testing and clinical trials of our vdas and oqps under development  including zybrestat  our lead compound  and oxi  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to developing manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending ourselves against possible claims of infringement by us of third party patent or other technology rights  the costs of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand is dependent in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval  for example the range of indications for which any product is granted approval 
in addition to equity capital financing  we continue to aggressively pursue other forms of capital infusion including strategic alliances with organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  as well as program structured financing facilities in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
if our existing funds are not sufficient to continue operations  we would be required to seek additional funding and or take other measures 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed  if at all 
in the event that all of the capital infusion initiatives discussed above are unsuccessful and should we be unable to sell shares under the ceff due to the limitations contained in the ceff agreement by the end of our fiscal second quarter  we are prepared to implement cost reduction measures 
these cost reduction measures would include the cessation or delay of at least two of the current or planned clinical studies of zybrestat and other supporting projects  the reduction and delay in hiring of development and administrative staff  the cessation of our preclinical study of our in licensed antibody protein oximab a  the delay or reduction in early stage development efforts in research with respect to our second generation vda  oxi  and the reduction of certain employee incentive programs 
contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years clinical development and related commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract 
the amounts in the table above assume the successful completion  by the third party contractor  of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements 
in addition  not included in operating leases above  is sublease income which totals approximately  for fiscal our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins 
in august  we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
this agreement was subsequently amended in june from the inception of the agreement through december   we have paid a total of  in connection with this license 
the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones  as defined in the agreement 
the license agreement also provides for additional 
table of contents payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds  as defined in the agreement 
future milestone payments under this agreement could total  we are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights 
in march  we entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of products covered by certain patent rights owned by intracel holdings  inc  a privately held corporation 
we paid intracel  in march as an up front license fee that provides full control over the development and commercialization of an anti b cell monoclonal antibody therapeutic  oximab a 
we expensed the up front payment to research and development expense 
the agreement provides for additional payments to intracel based on the achievement of certain clinical milestones and royalties 
these potential additional payments are not included in the contractual obligation table presented above due to their contingent nature 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we conduct a number of our trials and studies outside of the united states  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
