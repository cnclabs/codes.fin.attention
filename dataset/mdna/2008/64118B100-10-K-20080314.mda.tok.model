item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance processors and high speed integrated circuits that are deployed by original equipment manufacturers oems in routers  switches  wireless infrastructure equipment  network security appliances  datacenter servers  network access equipment and network storage devices to accelerate the delivery of voice  video  data and multimedia content for advanced enterprise  datacenter  communications and mobile wireless networks 
our products are incorporated in systems used throughout multiple types of networks that comprise the global internet infrastructure  including the enterprise  metro  access  edge and core networking markets  and are designed into systems offered by leading networking oems including alaxala networks corporation  alcatel lucent  arris group  inc  cisco systems  inc  extreme networks  inc  foundry networks  inc  force networks  inc  fujitsu limited  hitachi  ltd  huawei technologies co  ltd  and juniper networks  inc since the second half of  we have experienced significant revenue growth caused by a rapid rise in new customer orders for our knowledge based processors 
our total revenue increased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  from fiscal to million for fiscal  and by from fiscal to million for fiscal our total revenue for fiscal year ended december  was million  which represented an increase of over fiscal on february   we completed the acquisition of net assets of the nse business of cypress including the ayama  ayama  and nse product families  as well as the sahasra algorithmic search engine family the business 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complements our layer processing initiative and is a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
in addition  the nse  ayama and ayama expanded our product offerings in the high volume  entry level layer switch market 
on august   we purchased the tcam and tcam cr network search engine products collectively  the tcam products and certain related assets from cypress for a total cash purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition of the tcam products is expected to expand our revenue base and extend our market leadership into the desktop switching market segment 
on october   we completed the merger and acquisition of aeluros  inc the aeluros acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination during the fourth quarter of fiscal we paid million in cash upon the closing of the transaction in exchange for all of the outstanding equity securities of aeluros 
we reserved  shares of common stock for future issuance upon the exercise of unvested employee stock options of aeluros that we assumed and are subject to continued employment vesting requirements 
in addition  under the terms of the definitive agreement  we may be obligated to pay up to an additional million cash upon the attainment of performance milestones for the acquired business over the one year period following the close of the transaction 
any additional payment that we will owe is likely to be paid in the first quarter of approximately million of the initial purchase price has been withheld and placed in escrow as a form of security for certain indemnification and other obligations of the former aeluros stockholders as a fabless semiconductor company  our business is less capital intensive than others because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures aside from business acquisitions that we might make from time to time 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  however  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
we employ a direct sales force and a sales representative network to sell our products 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers headquartered in the united states  however  we also earn a significant 
table of contents amount from customers headquartered in countries outside the united states 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
our product sales cycles can take up to or more months to complete and volume production can take an additional six months to be achieved  if at all 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications might result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory or operating expenses 
our recent rapid revenue growth makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
in general  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to our customers or our international stocking sales representatives 
our revenue consists primarily of sales of our knowledge based processors  network search engines and gigabit ethernet physical layer products to networking oems and their contract manufacturers 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to networking oems 
once a design enters production  a networking oem often outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase products directly from us 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we transitioned into a just in time inventory model covering substantially all of our product shipments for cisco systems and its contract manufacturers 
as a part of this model  in the third quarter of  we entered into a purchase agreement with wintec industries who has become the primary purchaser of our products on a consignment basis for resale to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
we generally provided to wintec the same terms and conditions that we provide to cisco under the master purchase agreement between us and cisco  including our obligation to accept all purchase orders from wintec unless we are unable to meet wintec s schedule our obligation to ensure that we have the capacity to increase or decrease production of our products based upon wintec s demand forecasts our obligation to use our best efforts to meet wintec s stated cost reduction targets and to provide to wintec all price decreases that we achieve  cancellation rights for standard and custom products  and extended product warranties 
additionally  under this arrangement  we recognize revenue when wintec ships our product to cisco or its contract manufacturers 
we also have extended to wintec a credit limit sufficient to cover our anticipated annual business with cisco and its contract manufacturers 
given the volume of business that we anticipate to flow through wintec  and given our lack of payment history working with wintec  we require irrevocable letters of credit and reliable guarantees to support the credit limit we have extended to wintec 
in our discretion  we may accept orders from wintec that exceed the credit limit based on our analysis of the collectability of such orders and wintec s payment history 
as a consequence of the acquisition of the nse business from cypress  we began selling our products to a distributor in february we offered price protection and limited stock rotation rights to this distributor 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and price protection and other credits potentially issuable to this distributor  revenues and costs relating to sales to this distributor were deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notification from this distributor that it has resold the products to our end customer 
we have terminated our relationship with this distributor effective october  because we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our costs of revenue consists of payments to third party vendors 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers and rely upon them to fulfill our orders 

table of contents our research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  as well as costs related to new and existing product development  depreciation  software maintenance and facilities costs 
all research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred 
in order for us to remain competitive  we believe a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development efforts 
we also believe that research and development headcount will increase in the future  and that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars 
selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  marketing programs  travel  facilities overhead and bonuses and commissions for independent sales representatives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance and accounting  patent and corporate legal expenses  and facilities overhead 
our operating expenses are denominated primarily in us dollars  except for expenses incurred by our wholly owned subsidiary in india  which are denominated in the local currency 
the expenses incurred by our subsidiary in india  excluding any foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses which are recorded in interest and other income expense  net  were included in research and development expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue mainly from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from engineering services 
except for shipments to one distributor  we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  legal title and risk of ownership has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
our sales agreements do not provide for any customer acceptance provisions or return rights 
we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  additional products or enhancements 
customers  other than the distributor discussed below  have no rights of return unless the product does not perform according to specifications 
provisions for warranty expenses are recorded when revenue is recognized 
as a consequence of the acquisition of the nse business from cypress  we began selling our products to a distributor in february we offered price protection and limited stock rotation rights to this distributor 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and price protection and other credits potentially issuable to this distributor  we defer the recognition of revenues and costs relating to sales to this distributor deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notification from this distributor that it has resold the products to our end customer 
we have terminated our relationship with this distributor effective october  in the third and fourth quarters of  we transitioned into a just in time inventory model covering substantially all of our product shipments for cisco systems and its contract manufacturers 
as a part of this model  in the third quarter of  we entered into a purchase agreement with wintec industries who has become the primary purchaser of our products on a consignment basis for resale to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue when wintec ships our product to cisco or its contract manufacturers 
from time to time we perform engineering services for third parties 
engineering service revenue is recognized as services are performed  agreed upon milestones are achieved and customer acceptance  if required  is received from the customer 

table of contents inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional adjustment to inventory valuation may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
a small change in yield could result in a significant adjustment and have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
warranty accrual 
our products are subject to warranty for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of sale and we provide for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenue and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
in the future  as we continue to introduce new products  warranty expenses may increase 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  such allowances are established for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
in applying sfas  we are required to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
in the first quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
refer to note income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton valuation model the black scholes model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r  sab and our prior period pro forma disclosures of net income  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using both the historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of the awards  the related stock based compensation expense and  consequently  our results of operations 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit the table below sets forth the fluctuations in revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit data for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentage data year ended december  percentage of revenue year ended december  percentage of revenue year to year increase increase percentage revenue cost of revenue gross profits revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  increased by million compared with that of the year ended december  revenue from sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers represented of our total revenue for the year ended december   compared to during the year ended december  the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers was primarily due to the implementation of cisco s vendor managed inventory program during the second half of which resulted in lower levels of inventory at cisco as well as the implementation of a just in time inventory model the second quarter of by solectron corporation  one of cisco s contract manufacturers 
the revenue loss attributable to the implementation of these new manufacturing models in was partially offset by increased revenues of new products to cisco including the nl  nl  nl and tcam products which increased million from the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers was mitigated by an increase in revenue from our non cisco customers  which totaled million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  the increase in sales to non cisco customers was primarily driven by the increasing demand for our products in several emerging new markets  such as gigabit ethernet  cable infrastructure and iptv  in addition to the enterprise networking infrastructure market that has driven the demand for our products in the past 
the average selling price of our products decreased approximately from primarily due to increased revenues of our network search engine products into the high volume desktop switching segment 
in addition  we began shipping our newly acquired gigabit ethernet physical layer products in the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   alcatel lucent accounted for of our total product revenue compared to in cost of revenue gross profit gross margin 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased primarily due to the addition of intangible asset amortization expense and recording of the fair value inventory adjustments resulting from the acquisition of the tcam products from cypress semiconductor corp 
and the aeluros acquisition  both of which were completed in intangible asset amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the fair value inventory adjustments for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  the intangible asset amortization 
table of contents expense and fair value inventory adjustment recorded during the year ended december  related to the acquisition of nse business from cypress semiconductor corp 
the remainder of the increase in cost of sales during the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in sales of our products 
operating expenses the table below sets forth operating expense data for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentage data year ended december  percentage of revenue year ended december  percentage of revenue year to year increase decrease increase decrease percentage operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in product development and qualification expenses of million  stock based compensation expense of million  payroll related expenses of million  and travel expenses of million 
the increase in product development and qualification expense was primarily due to the production qualification and characterization for the nl and nl processors 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to the issuance of stock based compensation options and awards for additional engineering headcount  including the new employees who joined us through the aeluros acquisition 
the increase in payroll related expenses was primarily due to an increase in our engineering headcount in india to support our new product development efforts and the incremental employees as a result of the aeluros acquisition 
depreciation expense increased by million during the year ended december  as we purchased software and other tools to support our research and development efforts 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 
in process research and development 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of in process research and development iprd charge related to the aeluros acquisition 
the value assigned to iprd was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the fair values of iprd were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate of used in the present value calculations was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect additional risks related to the product s development and success as well as the product s stage of completion 
at december   we estimated that the aggregate costs to complete the projects would be million 
the projects are in process and expected to be completed in the first half of during the year ended december   we recorded million of iprd charge related to our acquisition of the nse business from cypress based upon our estimate of the fair values of assets acquired 
we acquired only one iprd project from cypress  which was related to the acquired sahasra algorithmic technology  that had not reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative use 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complemented our layer processing initiative and was a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost 
table of contents layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
as of december   we had completed the iprd project and incurred total post acquisition costs of approximately million 
we expect to benefit from it beginning in fiscal  which is consistent with our original estimate 
the development of the acquired technology remains a significant risk due to factors including the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million  payroll related expenses of million  accounting fees of million  legal expenses of million  consulting and outside vendor expenses of million  amortization of intangible assets expense of million and recruiting fees expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expense and payroll related expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for also included million of amortization expense for the customer relationship intangible asset related to the aeluros acquisition 
the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was caused by individually minor items 
other items the table below sets forth interest and other income expense  net for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentage data year ended december  percentage of revenue year ended december  percentage of revenue year to year change increase decrease change other income  net interest income other income expense  net total interest and other income  net interest and other income expenses  net 
the net interest and other income of million generated during the year ended december  was due to a higher average cash and investment balance during the period and higher market yields for our chosen investments 
provision for income taxes 
during the year ended december   we recorded income tax benefit of million  which included the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets and the tax impact of an intercompany license agreement 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 

table of contents stock based compensation under sfas no 
r on january   we adopted sfas r  on the modified prospective application method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases outstanding as of and awarded after january  the total stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  and was as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of stock based compensation in inventory as of december  and  which represented indirect manufacturing costs related to our inventory 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost  after estimated forfeitures  related to unvested employee stock options  restricted common stock and shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years

the increase in total revenue during the year ended december  resulted from the continued growth in sales of our knowledge based processors and from sales of products associated with the purchase of the cypress nse business 
during the year ended december   the volume of our knowledge based processor shipments increased approximately over fiscal the increase in our knowledge based processor sales for the year ended december  was driven by a million increase in the sales of our nl products  which was introduced in early  as well as a million increase in the sales of our nl products over fiscal revenue for the year ended december  also included approximately million from sales of the acquired nse products 
the average selling price of our products in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower average selling prices for the acquired nse products  which was lower than that of our knowledge based processor products in the recent period 
revenue from sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers represented of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers as a percentage of sales in was due to the growth of sales to other customers 

table of contents revenue for the year ended december  also included million of nre revenue 
no such revenue was recorded in fiscal we do not expect to generate this type of revenue regularly  however  we may enter into agreements that will generate nre revenue from time to time 
during the latter part of the year ended december   inventory level adjustments at some of our larger customers and slowing demand from our japanese customers resulted in reduced levels of new orders and slower revenue growth 
it appears that the inventory level adjustments were due to excess order placements by our customers in prior quarters to offset an anticipated shortage of organic substrates from suppliers used for some of our knowledge based processors 
it appears  however  that these suppliers did not experience such a shortage  but  as a consequence of their excess order placements earlier in the year  some of our larger customers were left with excess inventory of our knowledge based processors 
we believe this inventory level adjustment did not affect us materially in the future as our largest customers appeared to had completed their adjustment process during the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of revenue gross profit gross margin 
the increase in cost of revenue and gross profit during the year ended december  was primarily due to the continued growth in sales of our knowledge based processors 
improvements in our production yields also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million and million  respectively  for inventory that is not saleable 
the cost of revenue during the year ended december  included an additional provision of warranty reserve of million to address a warranty issue related to specific devices sold to one of our international customers  and approximately million of stock based compensation expense under sfas r that was inapplicable in the devices were tested by both us and the customer and passed quality assurance inspection at the time they were sold 
the customer subsequently identified malfunctioning systems that included our devices 
no specific warranty reserve was provided for additional units shipped subsequent to june  as the customer modified the software associated with its products to remedy the observed malfunction 
as of december  and  we maintained million of warranty reserves for anticipated replacement costs of the parts sold to this customer 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  also included million of amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of cypress nse business 
the nre revenue of million during the year ended december  had no associated cost  and accordingly generated gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was benefited by million from the sale of products that had been fully reserved in prior periods and accordingly had no associated cost of revenue 
this amount represented approximately of the gross margin during the year ended december

provision for income taxes 
income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and our effective tax rate in and was significantly less than statutory rates because we utilized net operating loss carry forwards  from which no previous benefit had been recognized to offset taxable income in the us liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents which totaled million

we also generated cash from a decrease of inventory of million  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  and other long term liabilities of million 
the cash generated was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million on higher sales of our products during the period  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 

table of contents our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   of which we obtained million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  and used million for the purchase of short term investments 
we used million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we used million to purchase the tcam products and certain related assets from cypress semiconductor and for the aeluros acquisition

the cash generated was offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million on higher sales of our knowledge based processors during the period  an increase in inventory of million primarily due to the addition of nse products acquired from cypress and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   of which million was for the purchase of short term investments 
we used million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we paid approximately million for expenses directly associated with the acquisition of the nse business from cypress 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by repayment of software license and other obligations 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities generated net cash of million 
for cash provided by operating activities  our primary source was net income of million  adjusted for non cash items of million primarily related to depreciation  amortization of deferred stock based compensation and provision for inventory reserves 
the provision for inventory reserves of million was primarily related to the write off of approximately million of inventory during the second quarter of the inventory write off was related to specific inventory that we mutually agreed with our foundry partner did not meet specifications 
this write off did not impact our cash flows during the year ended december  as we received wafer credits from the foundry partner for the same amount 
cash was also generated from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from our continued effort to improve cash collections 
the increases in accounts payable and accruals were primarily due to the growth of our overall operations and the timing of vendor invoice payments 
the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was for inventory  which 
table of contents increased as we ramped up our production volume in order to meet our customers increasing demand for knowledge based processors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december  cash was primarily used to purchase research and development design tools and computer equipment to support our growing operations 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  the primary sources of cash were the proceeds from exercises of stock options and repayment of stockholder notes received  which were offset by repayment of software license and other obligations 
capital resources we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months

however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in the interests of the company  including  but not limited to  from the sale of up to million of our debt and or equity securities before reductions for expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions under our shelf registration statement

these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
other obligations shown above represent million of adverse purchase commitments for which the inventory is considered unsalable

recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurement in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
sfas no 
defines how the fair value of assets and liabilities should be measured in more than other accounting standards where fair value measurement is allowed or required 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
sfas no 
requires fair value measurements to be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   including interim periods within that fiscal year 
the company is currently assessing sfas no 
and has not yet determined the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no

generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas no 
attempts to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities
