item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to developing innovative therapies for cancer and other serious diseases 
through our integrated drug discovery and development activities  we are building a portfolio of novel compounds that we believe have the potential to be high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical products 
our most advanced pharmaceutical programs focus on discovery and development of small molecule drugs for cancer 
utilizing our library of more than million compounds  we have integrated high throughput processes  medicinal chemistry  bioinformatics  structural biology and early in vivo testing into a process that allows us to efficiently and rapidly identify highly qualified drug candidates that meet our extensive development criteria 
to date  we have filed investigational new drug applications  or inds 
we believe that our deep pool of drug candidates will enable us to continue to file multiple new inds each year for the foreseeable future 
as our compounds advance into clinical development  we expect to generate a critical mass of data that will help us to understand the full clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates 
in addition to guiding the potential commercialization of our innovative therapies  these data may contribute to the understanding of disease and help improve treatment outcomes 
based on the strength of our expertise in biology  drug discovery  and development  we have established collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that allow us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees  research funding  a share of the profits and the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties as applicable from research results and subsequent product development activities 
we also have collaborations in which we retain the right to co promote products in the united states 
we have ongoing commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including smithkline beecham corporation which does business as glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and genentech  inc we expect to continue to use corporate partnering as a strategic tool to cultivate our assets  fund our operations and expand the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline 
our current development portfolio includes the following compounds  for which we are leading development compound principal targets indication stage of development xl egfr  her  vegfr cancer phase xl met  vegfr cancer phase xl kit  vegfr  pdgfr cancer phase xl met  vegfr  ret cancer phase xl mek cancer phase xl raf cancer phase xl jak cancer phase xl chk  chk cancer phase xl igfr  abl  src cancer phase xl pik cancer phase xl pik  mtor cancer phase out licensed to symphony evolution  inc and subject to a repurchase option as described elsewhere in this report

table of contents in december  glaxosmithkline exercised its option pursuant to our product development and commercialization agreement to further develop and commercialize xl we expect to transfer the xl development program to glaxosmithkline in the first quarter of pursuant to the product development and commercialization agreement  glaxosmithkline has the option to elect to develop up to two additional compounds in our product pipeline  which may include xl  xl  xl  xl and xl in addition to the compounds identified in the table above  we have compounds in various stages of development that are being developed by our partners  such as bristol myers squibb  daiichi sankyo company limited and wyeth pharmaceuticals  a division of wyeth 
we also have compounds in preclinical development that we are developing internally 
dispositions in  we completed the disposition of certain of our non core assets  as described more fully below 
sale of plant trait business on september   we entered into an asset purchase and license agreement  or apa  with agrigenetics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company  or agrigenetics 
under the terms of the apa  we sold to agrigenetics a major portion of our assets used for crop trait discovery  including a facility  and granted to agrigenetics licenses to certain other related assets and intellectual property 
as consideration for these assets and licenses  agrigenetics paid us million and is obligated to pay an additional million upon the first anniversary of the closing date for the transaction 
under the apa  we have agreed to indemnify agrigenetics and its affiliates up to a specified amount if they incur damages due to any infringement or alleged infringement of certain patents 
concurrently with the execution of the apa  we also entered into a contract research agreement  or the cra  with agrigenetics 
agrigenetics has agreed to pay us up to million in research and development funding over the term of the cra 
the research funding will cover employee costs  facilities expenses and capital expenditures 
after september   the closing date for the transaction  the research and development funding to be received over the term of the cra will be recognized as a reduction to expenses incurred by us in connection with our performance under the cra 
in order for us to perform our obligations under the cra  we are leasing at no cost the facility that agrigenetics acquired under the apa 
we are also entitled to receive additional payments of up to million from agrigenetics if we achieve the development of up to three designated assets during the term of the cra 
if development of any of the three designated assets is completed  the related payment will be treated as additional proceeds from the sale of our plant trait business 
the term of the cra is five years  unless earlier terminated 
agrigenetics may terminate the cra if we fail to complete the development of any of the three designated assets within our respective specified research periods or if we fail to cure a material breach within specified time periods 
following our development and transfer to agrigenetics of the second designated asset  either party may terminate the cra upon expiration of a specified notice period 
in the event that the cra is terminated prior to the end of the term  we will receive less than the maximum amount of research and development funding described above 
the transaction was accounted for as a sale of our plant trait business 
we recognized a gain of million  net of million in transaction costs 
the gain primarily consists of a purchase price of million  less a net book value of million of property and equipment  million of intangible assets acquired patents and the derecognition of million of goodwill 
we allocated goodwill to the disposed business based on the relative fair value of our plant trait business to exelixis excluding the value of the artemis pharmaceuticals reporting unit on september   the closing date for the transaction 

table of contents sale of interest in artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh on november   we entered into a share sale and transfer agreement with taconic farms  inc  or taconic  pursuant to which taconic acquired from us  for million in cash  of the outstanding share capital in our wholly owned subsidiary  artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  or artemis  located in cologne  germany 
artemis activities are directed toward providing transgenic mouse generation services  tools and related licenses to the industrial and academic community 
we also entered into a shareholders agreement and approved amended articles of association of artemis that govern the relationship between us and taconic as shareholders of artemis  particularly with respect to matters of corporate governance and the transfer of our respective ownership interests 
the shareholders agreement provides that we may require taconic to purchase our remaining interest in artemis between and or in the event of a change in control of taconic  and that taconic may require us to sell our interest to taconic between and or in the event of a change in control of exelixis  in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the shareholders agreement 
the amended articles of association provide for the establishment of a shareholders committee  in which we participate based on our ownership  to assist in the management of artemis 
the sale of of artemis was accounted for as a sale of a business 
we recognized a gain of million  net of million in transaction costs 
the gain primarily consists of cash received of million  plus million relating to the elimination of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and the elimination of net liabilities  less million of intangible assets acquired patents and derecognition of million of goodwill 
as we believe we have significant influence over the operations of artemis through our rights under the shareholders agreement and the amended articles  we will account for our remaining equity interest in artemis under the equity method of accounting 
we will subsequently adjust our investment balance to recognize our share of future artemis earnings or losses after the november  closing date 
as of december   the carrying value of our investment in artemis was approximately artemis revenues and net income loss after the effect of all intercompany eliminations are as follows in thousands for the year ended december revenues net income loss the revenues and net income for the year ended december  only include revenues through november   the closing date for the transaction 
certain factors that may affect our business industry wide factors successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
company specific factors our financial performance is driven by many factors  including clinical trials 
we currently have multiple compounds in clinical development and expect to continue to advance more compounds into clinical trials 
our compounds may fail to show adequate safety or 
table of contents efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the initiation or completion of clinical trials is exceedingly difficult and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of each of our compounds depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
in general  we will incur increased operating expenses for compounds that advance to the next stage of clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
liquidity 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities  which included investments held by sei of million and restricted cash and investments of million 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  investments held by sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which assumes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and depend on many factors  including the timing of key events in our agreements with glaxosmithkline and sei that may require us to use available capital significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
we will have to obtain additional funding in order to support our plans for the aggressive development of our broad clinical and preclinical pipelines 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by certain financial covenants contained in our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  which require us to maintain working capital of at least million and cash and investments of at least million 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
reliance on partners 
we currently have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate product revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our near term revenues  such as research and development funding and milestone and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
glaxosmithkline compound selection 
pursuant to our product development and commercialization agreement with glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline has the option to elect to develop up to three of our compounds from the programs specified in the product development and commercialization agreement 
in december  glaxosmithkline exercised its development option for xl as a result of glaxosmithkline s exercise of this option  glaxosmithkline has the right to select from the identified programs up to one additional compound  which may include xl  xl  xl  xl or xl  or up to two additional compounds if it extends the specified development term 
the amount of acceptance milestones that we receive from glaxosmithkline will depend on the number of compounds selected  the timing of the selection of the compounds and  for those acceptances made after the end of the original development term  whether glaxosmithkline extended the development term 
any future delays in obtaining clinical proof of concept for compounds subject to glaxosmithkline s election rights may decrease the size of any glaxosmithkline milestone payments and negatively affect our financial position 
if glaxosmithkline selects a second compound prior to the end of the development term under the product development and commercialization agreement in october  the amount of the selection milestone for the second compound would be at least million 
under our product development and commercialization agreement  any milestone payments relating to product candidates remaining under the agreement must be used to pay down our loan with glaxosmithkline as long as the loan is outstanding 
see liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
symphony evolution  inc in  we licensed three of our compounds  xl  xl and xl  to sei in return for an million investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
we have an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the equity of sei  thereby allowing us to reacquire 
table of contents xl  xl and xl at our sole discretion 
we cannot repurchase a single product candidate without also repurchasing the other two product candidates 
the purchase price  which may be paid in cash and or shares of our common stock  at our sole discretion  would be equal to the sum of the total amount of capital invested in sei by its investors million and an amount equal to per year on such funded capital  compounded from the time of funding 
as a result  the purchase price for the compounds licensed to sei increases over time 
the phase clinical development program for xl is ongoing  and glaxosmithkline has declined to exercise its development option for xl in order to retain rights to xl after the expiration of the purchase option period  we would be required to reacquire xl  xl and xl from sei s investors through the exercise of our exclusive purchase option 
in december  we discontinued the development of xl  and in january  glaxosmithkline declined to exercise its option to further develop and commercialize xl we do not intend to invest further in the development of xl  but will seek a partner with which to take the compound forward  which would also require us to repurchase all three compounds from sei s investors 
in order to repurchase the compounds  we would need to raise additional funds to cover the purchase price or issue to sei s investors a substantial number of shares of our common stock 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from the terms of our research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over our expected period of continuing involvement  generally the research term specified in the agreements 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenue recognized 
in certain 
table of contents situations  we may receive milestone payments after the end of our period of continued involvement 
in such circumstances  we would recognize of the milestone revenue when the milestone is achieved 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of up front fees  license payments  research and development services  milestone payments and future royalties 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  we recognized revenue of approximately million in related to arrangements for which the period of time over which the research and development will be performed was not contractually defined 
for this arrangement  if the research and development were delayed  the amount of revenue recognized in future periods could be reduced 
to date  there has not been a change in an estimate or assumption that had a material impact on our revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level and require us to perform a two step impairment test 
our reporting units have been determined to be consistent with our operating segments 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain  such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first known 
for example  during the quarter 
table of contents ended december   we recorded a reduction of million to our accrued clinical trial liabilities and research and development expenses related to our phase clinical trial for xl stock option valuation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r 
under this standard  our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

table of contents the increase from to in the amortization of upfront payments  including premiums paid on equity purchases  was driven primarily by upfront payments from the oncology collaboration we entered into with bristol myers squibb in december  resulting in increased revenues of million  and our co development collaboration with genentech relating to xl  resulting in increased revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by the completion of amortizing upfront payments from wyeth pharmaceuticals  resulting in decreased revenues of million  and from daiichi sankyo  resulting in decreased revenues of million

lab supplies lab supplies expense increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in our development activities related to our phase and phase clinical trials 
we currently estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the product candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we advance our compounds through development 
we currently do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval

these assets are amortized over specified time periods 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense in compared to was due to the completion of the amortization of the assembled workforce related to our acquisition of x ceptor therapeutics and the developed technology related to our acquisition of artemis 
in addition  amortization of intangible assets expense decreased as a result of our transaction in september with agrigenetics in which we sold million of acquired patents and our transaction in november in which we sold of the share capital of artemis  which included million of acquired patents

in september  we sold our plant trait business to agrigenetics  and  as a result  we recognized a gain of million in total other income 
the gain of million primarily consists of a purchase price of million  less million in net book value of tangible and intangible assets and the derecognition of million of goodwill 
as a result of the sale of of the share capital of artemis  we recognized a gain of million in total other income 
this gain primarily consists of cash received of million  plus million relating to the 
table of contents elimination of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and the elimination of net liabilities  less million of intangible assets acquired patents and the derecognition of million of goodwill 
the increase in total other income for compared to was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of a decrease in the principal balance of our debt from the repayment of our million convertible note to pdl biopharma  inc in may as well as higher average interest yields on our investments 
noncontrolling interest in symphony evolution  inc pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with sei and certain other parties in june  we consolidate sei s financial condition and results of operations in accordance with fin r 
accordingly  we have deducted the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest sei s losses from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations and we have also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in sei in the consolidated balance sheet by sei s losses 
the noncontrolling interest holders ownership in the consolidated balance sheet was million as of december  once sei s losses are in excess of the noncontrolling interest holders ownership  sei s losses will no longer be deducted from our net losses 
for the years ended december   and  the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in from in the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders is related to increased development expenses associated with xl and xl  which were partially offset by a decrease in development expenses associated with xl the increase in from in the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders is related to increased development expenses associated with xl  xl and xl income taxes we have incurred net losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any us federal or state income taxes

operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our loss from operations of million  partially offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
in addition  cash used in operating activities was reduced by million as the result of decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  other accrued expenses  other long term liabilities and deferred revenue 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to funding net losses  losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest and receivables

cash used in operating activities during related primarily to funding net losses and losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest  partially offset by changes in deferred revenues from collaborators and non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization 
as of december   we had received cash payments from collaborators relating to million in short term deferred revenue that we expect to recognize as revenue during 
table of contents the increase of million in cash used in our operating activities from as compared to was primarily driven by an increase in our loss from operations 
this increase in the loss from operations was primarily driven by an increase in research and development expenses 
this increase to cash used was partially offset by increases in accrued expenses  due to increased clinical trial activity  and a decrease in receivables 
the decrease of million in cash used in our operating activities from as compared to was primarily driven by increases in deferred revenues  accrued expenses  increased clinical trial activity and non cash charges related to stock based compensation expense recognized due to our adoption of sfas r 
these decreases to cash used were partially offset by increases in our net losses  losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest and receivables due to a milestone achieved under a collaboration agreement 
while cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net loss  operating cash flows differ from our net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition  expenses related to the noncontrolling interest and non cash charges 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in investing activities for was primarily driven by net purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
most of the cash invested in marketable securities and investments was generated by a common stock offering in and payments received from collaborators 
these uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of our plant trait business and artemis 
the proceeds provided by maturities of our marketable securities and the sale of investments by sei were used to fund our operations

financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock and million of proceeds from note payable and bank obligations 
these increases were partially offset by million of principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations 

table of contents cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock  a million capital draw by sei and the related funding by preferred shareholders of sei and million of proceeds from note payable and bank obligations 
these increases were partially offset by million of principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations  which included the repayment of million convertible promissory note to pdl biopharma 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily driven by net proceeds of million associated with the purchase and funding of the noncontrolling interest by preferred shareholders of sei and net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock 
in addition  we received million in cash from the purchase of million shares of our common stock by glaxosmithkline  which included a million premium 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities  merger and acquisition expenses and other general corporate purposes 
during  we have the ability to draw up to an additional million on an equipment line of credit 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes  bank obligations and loans from collaborators 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended december   and we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  investments held by sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which assumes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors that may require us to use available capital resources significantly sooner than we currently anticipate 
these factors include the timing and progress of the clinical development of our product candidate xl  which is out licensed to sei the phase clinical development program for xl is ongoing  and glaxosmithkline has declined to exercise its development option for xl in order to retain rights to xl after the expiration of the purchase option period  we would be required to reacquire xl  xl and xl from sei s investors through the exercise of our exclusive purchase option  which is described elsewhere in this report 
we cannot repurchase a single product candidate without also repurchasing the other two product candidates 
in december  we discontinued the development program for xl  and  in january  glaxosmithkline declined to exercise its option to further develop and commercialize xl we do not intend to invest further in the development of xl  but will seek a partner with which to take the compound forward  which would also require us to repurchase all three compounds from sei s investors 
the purchase price  which may be paid in cash and or shares of our common stock  at our sole discretion  would be equal to the sum of the total amount of capital invested in sei by its investors million and an amount equal to per year on such funded capital  compounded from the time of funding 
as a result  the purchase price for the compounds licensed to sei increases over time  whether and when glaxosmithkline selects at clinical proof of concept for further development and commercialization any additional product candidates under the amended pda  any milestone payments relating to product candidates remaining under the pda must be used to pay down our loan with glaxosmithkline as long as the loan is outstanding 
the amount of milestone payments that we receive from glaxosmithkline will depend on the number of compounds selected  the timing of the selection of the compounds and  for those acceptances made after the end of the original development 
table of contents term  whether glaxosmithkline extended the development term 
as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under our glaxosmithkline loan was million 
in december  glaxosmithkline exercised its option to further develop and commercialize xl as xl was the first compound selected by glaxosmithkline under the pda  the entire million selection milestone for xl was retained by glaxosmithkline to offset a milestone payment that glaxosmithkline paid to us in in connection with the amendment of the pda and was not used to pay down the loan 
an additional million from the first commercialization milestone for any product candidate selected by glaxosmithkline will also be offset against the milestone  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements as well as our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements that provide additional payments  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent clinical trials and other research and development projects  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies  and the cost and timing of establishing or contracting for sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  we will have to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in our collaboration with glaxosmithkline 
our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline dated october   as amended  contains financial covenants pursuant to which our working capital must not be less than million and our cash and investments must not be less than million 
if we were to default on the financial covenants under the loan and security agreement  glaxosmithkline may  among other remedies  declare immediately due and payable all outstanding obligations thereunder 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through external borrowings 
in addition  we may enter into strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of our compounds 
we currently have shelf registration statements on file with the sec that allow us to offer for sale from time to time common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants  either individually or in units 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness  and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us

the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable and bank obligations licensing agreements convertible loans operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes interest payable on the convertible loans of million 
the debt and interest payable can be repaid in cash or common stock at our election 
this obligation is described in further detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  bristol myers squibb exercised its option to develop and commercialize compound xl in addition  we exercised our option under the collaboration agreement to co develop and co commercialize xl in the united states 
due to our election to co develop and co commercialize xl  we will be required to pay of the worldwide development expenses

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe the effect that the adoption of sfas will be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb also ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by us in the first 
table of contents quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable sec regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except warrants and stock options 
our off balance sheet arrangements are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei and restricted cash and investments of million and million  respectively 
our marketable securities and investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated income taxes 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we have assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate
