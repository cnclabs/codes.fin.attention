during the second quarter of  we determined that the material handling europe businesses were not core to our long term growth strategy and  accordingly  began evaluating strategic options for these businesses 
taking into consideration the economic factors and business conditions in europe it became necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this analysis  the fair value of the reporting unit was based on estimated proceeds from a potential sale and the implied fair value of goodwill was estimated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value 
as a result of this analysis  all of the recorded goodwill of the reporting unit was determined to be impaired and  accordingly  we recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operating activities of continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared with million in the prior year 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of million increase in cash provided by working capital 
income from continuing operations of million excluding discontinued operations and non operating income decreased million from the prior year 
in addition  depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses were million in the current year  an increase of million compared with million in cash provided by working capital was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by working capital resulted from specific initiatives which successfully reduced accounts receivable and inventories by million and million  respectively 
in addition  accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided working capital of million 

table of contents during  cash increased approximately million from net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and cash of approximately million was used for the acquisition of businesses 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and are expected to be in the range of to million for the next years 
total debt at december  was million  a reduction of million from million at december  at december   the company had reduced working capital to million  with a current ratio of compared with working capital of and current ratio of at december  the company s credit agreement provides available borrowing up to million and has a five year term which expires october  the company is in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement at december  and had approximately million available under this agreement 
cash flow from operations and funds available under the credit agreement will provide the company s primary sources of future financing 
management believes that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet expected business requirements including capital expenditures  dividends  working capital and debt service 
the following summarizes the company s estimated future cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments less than year years years thereafter total dollars in thousands principal payments on debt interest lease payments retirement benefits total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of rate changes on earnings while maintaining the lowest overall borrowing cost 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately  annually 
some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and  as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
based on the acquisition of itml  the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has increased  primarily due to sales made in canada to customers in the united states denominated in us dollars 
in addition  the company s subsidiary in brazil has loans denominated in us dollars 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began a systematic hedging program to limit its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to its operations in canada and brazil 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency hedges in place 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to fluctuation as the market for these commodities changes 
the company monitors this risk but currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgements that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
while estimates and judgements are applied in arriving at reported amounts such as pension benefits and provisions for self insured risks  we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company also reviews historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  recorded goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our business units which  in turn  requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those businesses 
fair values are established using comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
the discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of the company s reporting units and ranged from to in in addition we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our business units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our business units 
our estimate of the fair values of these business units and the related goodwill  could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying business or the impact of future events on the cost of capital and the related discount rates used 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimates  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates both higher and lower than in the united states 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized
