item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting  providing our stockholders with informative disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with management s perspective on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
md a is presented in the following sections overview strategic initiatives critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations recent accounting developments forward looking statements overview we develop  manufacture  and market products that simplify  automate and innovate complex biomedical testing 
our products combine sophisticated analytical instruments  user friendly software and highly sensitive chemistries 
integration of all of these elements into a complete and simple to use system is a key competitive advantage for our organization 
our products are used in a range of applications  from lab solutions used for pioneering medical research  clinical research and drug discovery to diagnostic systems found in hospitals and physicians offices to aid in patient care 
we market our products in more than countries  with approximately of revenue in coming from outside the united states us 
our product lines include virtually all blood tests routinely performed in hospital laboratories and a range of systems for medical and pharmaceutical research 
we have more than  systems operating in laboratories around the world 
our instruments are generally provided to customers under operating type lease otl arrangements or cash sales 
many of our lease arrangements take the form of what are known as reagent rentals where an instrument is placed at a customer location and the customer commits to purchase a certain minimum volume of reagents annually 
we also enter into metered contracts with customers where the instrument is placed at a customer location with a stock of reagents 
the customer is then billed monthly based on actual usage of reagents 
in  we reviewed our leasing policies and in response to customer preferences decided to emphasize lease contracts with terms that resulted in more otls rather than sales type lease stl arrangements 
this shift to otls began in the third quarter of  and mostly impacted our operations in the us we expect these lease arrangements to improve competitiveness and operating efficiency over the long term 
under otls  the recognition of instrument revenue and earnings are spread over the life of the lease arrangement  which is typically five years 
by contrast  under stls  the recognition of instrument revenue and earnings is at the inception of the lease 
in  nearly all of our leases were otls 
the lease revenue relating to equipment from otl leases in the us was million in placements of our instrument systems continue to drive growth in aftermarket consumables revenue 
our large installed base provides us with a significant competitive advantage and drives this profitable stream of aftermarket consumables and service 
placements of products serving the clinical diagnostics markets chemistry systems  immunoassay systems  the majority of products within cellular systems and some of the products within discovery and automation systems have been experiencing growth as test volumes continue to increase as a result of factors such as an aging population  increasing expenditures on chronic diseases  an increase in medical conditions requiring ongoing treatment for example  diabetes  aids and cancer and greater acceptance of modern medicine in emerging markets 
our customers are faced with increasing volumes of testing  a shrinking skilled labor pool and are under constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective systems to remain competitive 
a large number of the products in the discovery and automation systems product area are dependent on academic research funding and capital spending in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and clinical research markets 

table of contents products such as the unicel dxi access immunoassay system  the unicel dxc and synchron clinical chemistry systems and the auto mate front end automation system provide our customers with a means to increase efficiency through automation and workstation consolidation 
we believe these industry leading  high throughput systems have positioned us to gain market share and increase streams of reagent revenue in the coming years 
to further the potential of these systems  we are developing new assays internally  collaborating with external parties and pursuing business and technology acquisitions 
in hematology  we continue to automate more of the testing process with recently introduced systems to serve both high volume hospital labs and small to mid sized labs 
our after market sales of reagent kits  supplies and service historically have allowed us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we have used this cash flow in the past to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development as well as business and technology acquisitions 
our shift to otls which began in requires additional investment in our customer leased instruments and requires an increase in our capital expenditures over the next few years until we reach the end of the five year transition to otls which began in we expect our operating cash flows to build as our depreciation and amortization from our lease portfolio builds over the next few years 
we expect the majority of our lease arrangements to be otls in future years 
we have also used our operating cash flows to acquire companies and technologies  repurchase shares of our common stock and pay regular quarterly dividends 
in order to continue to grow  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new instrument and reagent technologies and remain at the forefront in helping our customers improve patient health and reduce the cost of care 
continued investment in new technologies and emerging markets create a pathway to sustain above market growth 
evolving markets such as immunoassay and molecular diagnostics offer tremendous opportunity for innovation and commercialization 
to remain competitive we must also acquire and defend intellectual property and invest in research and development 
otherwise  our current products could become technologically obsolete over time 
while we believe that our cash flows will enable us to continue to fund these activities  we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could hamper our efforts to successfully increase market share and expand into new markets 
among other factors  those risks include general worldwide economic weakness  pressure on healthcare spending  constrained government research funding and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for new products 
we believe we are addressing these risks by providing our customers automated and cost effective solutions 
a large number of our products require marketing authorizations from the fda and similar agencies in other countries 
we believe that we have effective quality and compliance programs in place and have been successful in obtaining the necessary clearances for our new products from the fda and other similar agencies 
acquisitions lumigen in november  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of lumigen  inc lumigen  a world leading developer and manufacturer of novel detection chemistries for high sensitivity testing in clinical diagnostics and life science research for a purchase price of approximately million 
lumigen s chemiluminescent chemistry is the detection method used in our access family of immunoassay systems 
the acquisition was financed through a million bridge loan  which was subsequently repaid with proceeds from our convertible notes offering in december nexgen diagnostics  llc nexgen in connection with the acquisition of lumigen  we acquired a equity interest in nexgen  an entity formed by us and certain former employees of lumigen for the purpose of developing certain technology  hereinafter referred to as the contributed intellectual property ip 
this ip was contributed by lumigen to nexgen in return for an ownership interest in nexgen 
at the time of acquisition  quantifying a value associated with the ip was difficult to do as the parties could not reasonably estimate the costs to complete the project  the potential demand for the anticipated new product  and the manufacturing costs 
as a result  the ip was excluded from the november lumigen acquisition 
in november  we acquired the remaining interest in nexgen for a total purchase price of million 
nexgen was considered a development stage enterprise and the ip obtained at the time of formation was the only asset of nexgen 
the acquired ip was reviewed to determine its fair value 
given that the project is currently at the beginning of the applied research phase and will require significant costs to bring it out of the research stage  the majority of the amount paid was deemed to be in process research and development ipr d and expensed accordingly
