the company offers specialized loans for its business and commercial customers 
these include operating lines of credit that support accounts receivables and inventory  as well as secured term loans to finance machinery and equipment 
the company has historically reported loans in accordance with bank regulatory guidelines 
as a result  a substantial portion of the company s commercial loans are designated as real estate loans  as the loans are secured by mortgages or trust deeds on real property  although some of these loans were not made to finance real estate nor does the repayment depend on the sale of or income from the real estate

the company provides drive through facilities at three of its branches 
market areas and competition the company s primary market areas in which it accepts deposits and makes loans are cowlitz county  in southwest washington  king county  washington  the portland metropolitan area in oregon  and the surrounding counties in washington and northwest oregon 
as a community bank  the bank has certain competitive advantages due to its local focus  but is also more closely tied to the local community than many of its competitors  which serve a number of geographic markets 
bay mortgage operations are concentrated in southwestern washington 
according to the us department of labor bureau of labor statistics website  both washington th at and oregon st at were among the states with relatively high unemployment rates during december washington s december unemployment rate declined from a year ago 
the seattle metropolitan area s unemployment rate not seasonally adjusted was and ranked out of metropolitan areas 
washington ranked in the top ten states for year over year job growth in and oregon s december unemployment rate increased from a year ago 
the portland vancouver metropolitan area s unemployment rate was and ranked the increase in the unemployment rate reflects the decline in the residential real estate construction industry 
the longview area in cowlitz county  washington  continues to experience cyclically higher levels of unemployment than the seattle metropolitan area 
in december  unemployment in cowlitz county was  an increase of from a year ago 
the increase primarily reflected recent workforce reductions in the forest products industry 
in the first quarter of  the federal reserve made a series of interest rate cuts to support a softening national economy 
contributing to concerns about a us recession in are the significant declines in most residential real estate markets and the increase in mortgage loan delinquencies and foreclosures  increasing unemployment rates  higher energy costs and lower consumer confidence 
according to standard poor s s p case shiller quarterly index  for the fourth quarter of  portland  oregon and seattle  washington  were two of the three major metropolitan areas out of to show year over year increases in existing single family home prices 
however  the company expects the economy in the pacific northwest to generally follow the direction of the national economy in commercial banking in the state of washington and northwest oregon is highly competitive with respect to providing banking services including making loans and attracting deposits 
the company competes with other banks  as well as with savings and loan associations  savings banks  credit unions  mortgage companies  investment banks  insurance companies  securities brokerages and other financial institutions 
banking in washington and oregon is dominated by several significant banking institutions which together account for a majority of the total commercial and savings bank loans and deposits in washington and oregon 
these 
table of contents competitors have significantly greater financial resources and offer a greater number of branch locations with statewide branch networks  higher lending limits  and a variety of services not offered by the bank 
the company has attempted to offset some of the advantages of the large competitors by arranging participations with other banks for loans above its legal lending limits  as well as leveraging technology and third party arrangements to deliver financial products and better compete in targeted customer segments 
the company has positioned itself as a local alternative to larger competitors that may be perceived by customers or potential customers to be impersonal  out of touch with the community  or simply not interested in providing banking services to some of the target customers  by offering excellent customer service and investing in the markets it services through its business practices and community service 
in addition to larger institutions  other community banks and credit unions have been formed  expanded  or moved into the company s market areas and have developed a similar focus to the company 
this growing number of similar financial institutions and an increased focus by larger institutions on the company s market segments has led to intensified competition in all aspects of the company s business 
increased competitive pressure and changing customer deposit behaviors could adversely affect the bank s market share of deposits 
the adoption of the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act led to further competition in the financial services industry 
the glb act eliminated many of the barriers to affiliation among providers of various types of financial services and permitted business combinations among financial service providers such as banks  insurance companies  securities or brokerage firms and other financial service providers 
additionally  the rapid adoption of financial services through the internet has reduced or even eliminated many barriers to entry by financial services providers physically located outside our market areas 
for example  remote deposit services allow depository companies physically located in other geographical markets to service local businesses with minimal cost of entry 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in the financial services business in its markets to date  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
the financial services industry has experienced widespread consolidation over the last decade 
the company anticipates that consolidation among financial institutions in its market areas will continue 
as noted the company may seek acquisition opportunities in markets of strategic importance to it from time to time 
however  other financial institutions aggressively compete against the company in the acquisition market 
some of these institutions may have greater access to capital markets  larger cash reserves and stock for use in acquisitions that is more liquid and more highly valued by the market 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of full time equivalent employees 
none of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company considers its relationships with its employees to be favorable

bank regulation 
the bank is organized under the laws of the state of washington and is subject to the supervision of the dfi  whose examiners conduct periodic examinations of state banks

the company believes that these restrictions do not have a material adverse effect on its current operations 
fdicia 
fdicia requires  among other things  federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the fdic has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
among other things  the regulations define the relevant capital measures for the five capital categories 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to a regulatory order  agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the federal reserve board classifies a bank holding company as well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater and a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater 
the company and the bank are both well capitalized 

table of contents fdicia further directs that each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  management compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value of publicly traded shares and such other standards as the agency deems appropriate 
capital requirements 
the fdic has adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which the bank is subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
these guidelines divide a bank s capital into two tiers 
tier includes common equity  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding auction rate issues and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships  subject to certain limitations 
supplementary tier capital includes  among other items  preferred stock cumulative perpetual and long term  limited life  mandatory convertible securities  certain hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations  less required deductions 
banks are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  of which must be tier capital 
the fdic may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
in addition  the fdic has established guidelines prescribing a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to adjusted total assets of for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including that the banks have the highest regulatory rating and are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
all other banks are required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of not less than 
at december   the regulatory capital ratios for the company and the bank were december  company bank total risk based capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage ratio dividends 
the principal source of the company s cash revenues is dividends from the bank 
under washington law  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount greater than its retained earnings as determined by generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  dfi has the authority to require a state chartered bank to suspend the payment of dividends 
the fdic has the authority to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank or if it would cause a bank to become undercapitalized 
lending limits 
under washington law  the total loans and extensions of credit by a washington chartered bank to a borrower outstanding at one time may not exceed of the bank s tier capital 
however  this limitation does not apply to loans or extensions of credit which are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having market value of at least of the amount of the loan or the extension of credit at all times 
branches and affiliates 
establishment of bank branches is subject to approval of the dfi and fdic and geographic limits established by state laws 
washington s branch banking law permits a bank having its principal place of business in the state of washington to establish branch offices in any county in washington without geographic restrictions 
a bank may also merge with any national or state chartered bank located anywhere in the state of washington without geographic restrictions 

table of contents under oregon law  an out of state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company if the oregon bank  or in the case of a bank holding company  the subsidiary bank  has been in existence for a minimum of three years  and the law of the state in which the acquiring bank is located permits such merger 
branches may not be acquired or opened separately  but once an out of state bank has acquired branches in oregon  either through a merger with or acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an oregon bank  the bank may open additional branches 
the bank is subject to provisions of the federal reserve act that restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies 
the statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates  prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank s extension of credit to an affiliate 
deposit insurance 
the bank s deposits are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif

fdic regulations set deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association poses to the deposit insurance fund 
this system bases an institution s risk category partly upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of three supervisory categories based on reviews by regulators  statistical analysis of financial statements and other relevant information 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned 
the reform act created a new system and assessment rate schedule to calculate an institution s assessment 
for  the assessment rates ranged from to per of deposits annually 
assessment rates for well managed  well capitalized institutions ranged from to per of deposits annually 
the bank s assessment rate for fell within this range and is expected to fall within this range for in  the fdic issued one time assessment credits that were used to offset fdic assessments

community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires financial institutions regulated by the federal financial supervisory agencies to ascertain and help meet the credit needs of their delineated communities  including low income and moderate income neighborhoods within those communities  while maintaining safe and sound banking practices 
the regulatory agency assigns one of four possible ratings to an institution s cra performance and is required to make public an institution s rating and written evaluation 
the four possible ratings are outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve and substantial non compliance 
many factors play a role in assessing a financial institution s cra performance 
the institution s regulator must consider its financial capacity and size  legal impediments  local economic conditions and demographics and the competitive environment in which it operates 
the evaluation does not rely on absolute standards and financial institutions are not required to perform specific activities or to provide specific amounts or types of credit 
the company s most recent rating under cra is satisfactory 
this rating reflects the company s commitment to meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves 
although the company strives to maintain a satisfactory or higher rating  no assurance can be given that the company will maintain this rating in the future 
if the company s cra rating were to fall below satisfactory it may inhibit its ability to obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansion 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of addressed public company corporate governance  auditing  accounting  executive compensation  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees

table of contents the sec has adopted regulations to implement various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  including disclosures in periodic filings pursuant to the exchange act 
also in response to the sarbanes oxley act  nasdaq adopted new standards for listed companies 
in  the sec extended the requirement for a company s auditor to attest to management s assessment of internal controls for a small company  as defined by the sec

the usa patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records 
the department of the treasury is empowered to administer and make rules to implement the act  which to some degree  affects the bank s record keeping and reporting expenses 
should the bank s aml compliance program be deemed insufficient by federal regulators  the company would not be able to grow through acquiring other institutions or opening de novo branches 
additional matters 
the company and the bank are subject to additional regulation of their activities  including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting lending  deposit and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities 
the earnings of financial institutions  including the company and the bank  are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates  both domestic and foreign and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its various agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
additional legislation and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the united states congress  the washington legislature and various regulatory agencies  including those referred to above 
it cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislation or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or the company and the bank in particular would be affected 
item a 
risk factors the company is extremely sensitive to the economy of the pacific northwest 
the company operates primarily in cowlitz county  washington  the seattle bellevue metropolitan area  and the vancouver  washington and portland  oregon metropolitan area 
local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the ability of the company s customers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing loans  the demand for the company s products and services  and the stability of deposits that create liquidity to support lending activities 
a sustained economic downturn could affect these local economies  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the company has a concentration of real estate collateral securing loans 
many of the company s loans are secured by real estate located in washington and oregon 
a decline in the real estate market could lead to a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to the company s customers 
the company s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would be diminished  and the company would be more likely to incur losses on defaulted loans 
interest rates are subject to constant  often unpredictable changes and could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
interest and fees on loans and securities  net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings  are a large part of the company s net income 
interest rates are key drivers of net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond the control of management 
as interest rates change  net interest income is affected 
rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities and rapid decreases in interest rates could result in interest income decreasing faster than interest expense  for example  when management is unable to match decreases in market interest rates  lowering earning assets yield  with reduced rates paid on deposits or borrowings 
further  substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth  particularly in construction lending  an important factor in the company s revenue growth over the past two years 
decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities  and therefore decrease net interest income 
for more information on this topic see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate 
the risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities  and nonpayment  if it occurs  may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
the company maintains a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable loan losses inherent in the loan and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the reserve  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan portfolio 
if the company s assumptions are incorrect  the reserve for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company establishes its level of reserve for credit losses as a result of management s continued evaluation of specific credit risks  loan loss experience  quality of the current loan portfolio  loan concentrations  economic conditions  regulations  political climate  new information about borrowers  additional problem loans and other factors 
we may be subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the bank s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
in the ordinary course of business  the bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances will be found on these properties  in which case the bank may be liable for remediation costs and related personal injury and property damage 
compliance with environmental laws may require the bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the bank s ability to use or sell the affected property 
environmental indemnifications obtained from borrowers and their principals or affiliates may not adequately compensate the bank for losses related to environmental conditions 
the remediation costs and financial liabilities associated with environmental conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our information technology and communications systems to conduct our business 
we depend on uninterrupted and successful functioning of our information technology and communications systems  many of which are provided by third parties 
we rely on outsourced systems to provide customer service and complete banking transactions 
disruptions in these systems could affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 
if a third party service provider experiences operational or financial difficulties that interfere with their ability to serve us  our operations could be harmed 

table of contents the financial services industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes with well established  large banks based outside of the region  community banks  credit unions  thrift institutions  investment banking firms  insurance companies  payday loan offices and mortgage lenders for depositors and borrowers 
management believes the most significant competitive factor is customer service  in addition to competitively priced loans and deposits  for structure  branch locations and the range of banking products and services offered 
offices of the major financial institutions have competitive advantages over the company in that they have high public visibility  may offer a wider variety of products and are able to maintain advertising and marketing activities on a much larger scale than the company can economically maintain 
since single borrower lending limits imposed by law are dependent on the capital of the institution  the branches of larger institutions with substantial capital bases also have an advantage with respect to loan applications that are in excess of the company s legal lending limits 
in competing for deposits  the company is subject to certain limitations not applicable to non bank financial institution competitors 
previous laws limiting the deposit instruments and lending activities of savings and loan associations have been substantially eliminated  thus increasing the competition from these institutions 
in cowlitz county  the main source of competition for deposits is the relatively large number of credit unions 
federal and state regulations applicable only to banks and bank holding companies also place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies  credit unions  mortgage banking companies and leasing companies 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market area in the past  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so 
with significant competition in the company s market areas  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to attract significant loan and deposit customers 
the inability to attract these customers could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the financial services industry is heavily regulated and additional laws and regulations are often considered at the state and federal level 
federal and state regulations are designed to protect depositors  federal deposit insurance funds  consumers and the banking system  not our shareholders 
banking regulations can significantly restrict our business 
additional laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holdings companies are often proposed at the state and federal levels  which could affect our ability to compete with non bank companies 
the operations of the company and the bank may be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory changes as well as by changes in the policies of various regulatory authorities 
the company cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects that such changes may have in the future on its business and earnings 
failure to comply with the laws or regulations could result in fines  penalties  sanctions and damage to the company s reputation which could have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
if we acquire companies in the future  our earnings could be reduced if we are unable to successfully integrate operations 
we explore opportunities to acquire other banks 
if we are able to find a suitable acquisition opportunity and negotiate and close a transaction  but we experience difficulty in integrating an acquired company  consequently  we may not realize expected revenue enhancements  cost savings  increases in geographic presence or other projected benefits 
integration could also disturb customer and employee relationships at the acquired company  causing deposit run off and loss of key employees 
resources spent on integration may also detract from our ability to grow existing business 

table of contents the company may not be able to attract or retain key banking employees 
the company strives to attract and retain key banking professionals  management and staff 
competition to attract the best professionals in the industry can be intense which will limit the company s ability to hire new professionals

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion of significant business trends and uncertainties as well as certain forward looking statements and is intended to be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the consolidated financial statements of the company and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements  see item a 
risk factors and the risk factors discussed on page immediately following the table of contents 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of  or per diluted share 
this compares with net income of million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the corresponding periods ended december   and  respectively 
average loans in totaled million  an increase of over  and up significantly from million in this loan growth  primarily in commercial and real estate loans  was funded mostly by the growth in deposits  with a significant portion consisting of certificates of deposits 
net interest income was down slightly compared with results  and up over results 
the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was in  compared with and in and  respectively 
the decline in net interest margin in related to several factors  including recent federal reserve rate cuts  competitive loan and deposit pricing  and interest reversals on non accrual loans  as well as a higher level of non accrual loans 
the company s provision for credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs of million were recorded in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the charge offs in primarily related to residential land acquisition and development loans 
at december   total non performing assets were million compared with million at year end and million at december  non performing assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more and still accruing  and repossessed assets 
non interest income and non interest expenses in increased significantly when compared with  reflecting an overall higher level of staffing  occupancy  data processing and branch activities due to loan growth and the expansion of the company s international trade finance capabilities 
in  the company incurred higher levels of professional fees related to efforts to comply with sarbanes oxley act requirements and to higher levels of non performing assets 
critical accounting policies the company s most critical accounting policy is related to the allowance for credit losses 
the company utilizes both quantitative and qualitative considerations in establishing an allowance for credit losses believed to be appropriate as of each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  the level of geographic and or industry concentration  
table of contents the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs  and other known factors regarding specific loans 
qualitative factors include the effectiveness of credit administration  the adequacy of loan review  the adequacy of loan operations personnel and processes  the effect of competitive issues that impact loan underwriting and structure  the impact of economic conditions including interest rate trends  the introduction of new loan products or specific marketing efforts  large credit exposure and trends  and industry segments that are exhibiting stress 
changes in the above factors could significantly affect the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management performs a full analysis  no less often than quarterly  to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
for further discussion of this significant management estimate  see allowance for credit losses 
another critical accounting policy of the company is that related to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill on january  and periodically tests intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
impairment analysis of the fair value of goodwill involves a substantial amount of judgment  as does establishing and monitoring estimated amounts and lives of other intangible assets 
net interest income for financial institutions  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  the total dollar amount of interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  the resulting yields or costs  net interest income  and net interest spread

provision for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is analyzed by management on a regular basis to ensure that it is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date 
when a provision for credit losses is recorded  the amount is based on the current volume of loans and commitments to extend credit  anticipated changes in loan volumes  past charge off experience  management s assessment of the risk of loss on current loans  the level of non performing and impaired loans  evaluation of future economic trends in the company s market area  and other factors relevant to the loan portfolio 
an internal loan risk grading system is used to evaluate potential losses of individual loans 
the company does not  as part of its analysis  group loans together by loan type to assign risk 
see the allowance for credit losses disclosure for a more detailed discussion 
the company s provision for credit losses was million for the year ended december   compared with million and  the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the provision for credit losses was largely due to the fourth quarter provision for credit losses of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company charged off loans totaling million  primarily related to residential land acquisition and development loans in the portland  oregon and southwest washington markets 
in addition  a portion of the increase in the provision was consistent with the current credit cycle and reflected the impact of loan growth  loan mix changes and current loan risk ratings of the portfolio 
the increase in the provision in compared with reflected strong loan growth  but also included the impact of a million charge off due to a loss on a nationally syndicated equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud committed by the lessee 
in  over of loan and lease charge offs were non real estate related 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was of total loans compared to and at december  and  respectively 
if loan volumes continue to increase  or if the overall quality of the portfolio were to decline  provisions for credit losses would be expected to increase in future periods

the loan portfolio is regularly reviewed to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  the company estimates losses inherent in all loans and commitments to make loans  and evaluates non performing loans to determine the amount  if any  necessary for a specific reserve 
an important element in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is an analysis of loans by loan risk rating categories 
at a loan s inception and periodically throughout the life of the loan  management evaluates the credit risk by using a risk rating system 
this grading system currently includes eleven levels of risk 
risk ratings range from for the strongest credits to for the weakest 
a rated loan would normally represent a loss 
all loans rated are collectively the company s watch list 
the specific grades from are watch list risk rating  special mention risk rating  substandard risk rating  doubtful risk rating  and loss risk rating 
when indicators such as operating losses  collateral impairment or delinquency problems show that a credit may have weakened  the credit will be downgraded as appropriate 
similarly  as borrowers bring loans current  show improved cash flows or improve the collateral position of a loan  the credits may be upgraded 
the result of management s ongoing evaluations and the risk ratings of the portfolio is an allowance with four components specific reserves  general reserves  special reserves  and an amount available for other factors 
specific allowance 
loans on the bank s watch list  as described above  are specifically reviewed and analyzed 
management considers in its analysis expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
when significant conditions or circumstances exist on an individual loan indicating greater risk  specific reserves may be allocated in addition to the general reserve percentage for that particular risk rating  as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 

table of contents general allowance 
all loans that do not require a specific allocation are subject to a general allocation based upon historic loss factors 
management determines these factors by analyzing the volume and mix of the existing loan portfolio  in addition to other factors 
management also analyzes the following the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  and the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs 
special allowance 
special allowances are established to facilitate changes in the bank s strategy and other factors 
special allocations are to take into consideration various factors that include  but are not limited to effectiveness of credit administration  adequacy of loan review  the adequacy of loan operations personnel and processes  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  the level of geographic and or industry concentration  the effect of competitive issues that impact loan underwriting and structure  the impact of economic conditions  including interest rate trends  the introduction of new loan products or special marketing efforts  large credit exposure and trends  and commercial real estate acquisition and development portfolio amounts available for other factors 
management also attempts to ensure that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of expected loan losses 
the quarterly analysis of specific  general  and special allocations of the allowance is the principal method relied upon by management to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
the inclusion of historical loss factors in the process of determining the general component of the allowance also acts as a self correcting mechanism of management s estimation process  as past and more remote loss experience is replaced by more recent experience 
in its analysis of the specific  the general  and special allocations of the allowance  management also considers regulatory guidance in addition to the company s own experience 
liability for unfunded credit commitments 
management determines the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments based upon reviews of individual credit facilities  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of commitments and other relevant factors 
the liability is based on estimates  which are evaluated on a regular basis  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
loans and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
draws on unfunded commitments that are considered uncollectible at the time funds are advanced are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for unfunded commitment losses are added to the liability for unfunded commitments  which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs when and if they occur 
the related provision for credit losses that is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined through the above process 

table of contents the following table shows the components of the allowance for credit losses at the dates indicated december  december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent general specific special available for other factors total allowance for credit losses the increase in the total allowance for credit losses in was primarily due to loan growth and management s current assessment of economic  market and business conditions  which are noted above under special reserves 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was of total loans and of non performing loans  compared with an allowance for credit losses at december  of of total loans and of total non performing loans respectively 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  and  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for credit losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant it 

table of contents during the first quarter of  the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to unfunded credit commitments  such as letters of credit and the available portion of credit lines  was reclassified from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities on the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded net charge offs of million  primarily related to four real estate loans in the portland  oregon and southwest washington markets 
the increase in net charge offs in compared with was primarily due to a million charge off of a loss on a nationally syndicated equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud committed by the lessee 
in  over of the company s loan and lease charge offs were non real estate related 
the company believes that it has an effective credit review process and appropriate methodology for addressing problem exposures 

table of contents non performing assets non performing loans include all loans greater than days past due with respect to either principal or interest  and all loans to which the accrual of interest has been suspended 
these loans  combined with repossessed real estate and other repossessed assets  are collectively considered to be non performing assets

one loan totaling million was sold in january of without additional loss 
other real estate owned at year end related to the residential development property foreclosed on in the fourth quarter of other repossessed assets at year end primarily related to equipment repossessed in connection with the foreclosed equipment lease previously discussed 
the increase in non performing assets in was primarily related to loans acquired from aea 
the company sold the majority of aea impaired assets shortly after the acquisition and retained certain non performing loans totaling million 
there were no loans classified as restructured at the dates presented 
impaired loans the company  during its normal loan review procedures  considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered to be impaired during a period of minimal delay less than days unless available information strongly suggests impairment 
the company measures impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts  and collateral position  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in non accrual loans was million and million  respectively 
for these loans  there were no specific reserves at december  and the average recorded investment in non accrual loans for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
generally  no interest is accrued on loans when factors indicate collection of interest is doubtful or when principal or interest payments become days past due  unless collection of principal and interest are anticipated within a reasonable period of time and the loans are well secured 
for such loans  previously accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current earnings  and income is only recognized to the extent payments are subsequently received and collection of the remaining recorded principal balance is considered probable 

table of contents other assets comparing to  the company s other assets increased million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of the company s interest rate contracts of million and an increase in miscellaneous receivables of million as a result of selling two securities on december  with a settlement date of january  deposits the following table sets forth the composition of the company s deposit liabilities and associated weighted average rates on the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands ending balance average balance weighted average rate ending balance average balance weighted average rate ending balance average balance weighted average rate non interest bearing demand deposits savings interest bearing demand deposits money market accounts certificates of deposit under  certificates of deposit over  total total deposits at december  increased over total deposits at year end and total deposits at year end increased over year end the company s loan growth in and exceeded its core deposit generation  and the company supplemented its core deposits with certificates of deposits  including brokered deposits  and brokered money market deposits 
at december   brokered deposits were million  or of total deposits  compared with million or of total deposits at december  in  the company entered into two long term depository relationships that provide the company up to million of money market accounts 
the interest rate on these accounts is based on the daily effective federal funds rate  as published by the federal reserve  plus a spread 
at december   the company had million of these variable rate money market deposits  and the average for the year was million 
although a significant amount of certificates of deposits will mature and reprice in the next months  the company expects to retain the majority of such balances 
these deposits can generally be retained and or expanded with increases in rates paid  which could increase the company s cost of funds in the future

impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
management believes that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on the ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
management has an asset liability program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
the financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires the bank to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the bank s control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the principal purpose of asset liability management is to manage the company s sources and uses of funds to maximize net interest income under different interest rate conditions with minimal risk 
a key component of the asset liability management is the measurement of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  variability in spread relationships  and the mismatch of re pricing intervals between assets and liabilities 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the policy of the company is to control the exposure of the company s earnings to changing interest rates by generally maintaining a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral or balanced position 
the board of directors has established guidelines for maintaining the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
this analysis provides an indication of the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
at december   the analysis indicated that the earnings risk was within the company s policy guidelines 

table of contents the following table presents interest rate sensitivity data at december  interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s interest rate view in subsequent periods 
active management dictates that longer term economic views are balanced against the prospects of short term interest rate changes in all re pricing intervals

table of contents market risk interest rate and credit risks are the most significant market risks impacting the company s performance 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company relies on loan reviews  prudent loan underwriting standards and an adequate allowance for credit losses to mitigate credit risk 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s gap position see asset liability management interest rate sensitivity and sensitivity to interest rate risk by subjecting the company s balance sheet to hypothetical interest rate shocks 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability position to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company utilizes asset liability modeling software to determine the effect of a shift in market interest rates  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points 
the model utilized to create the table presented below is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount or at the same time 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on the adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase due to adjustments in the amount of the payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the gaps between assets and liabilities 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change and each category of asset liability  and the amount of any change in the federal funds rate 
local market conditions and the strategy of the company determine the weights for loan and core deposits  while national markets set the other weights 
in addition  a timing factor has been used as fixed rate instruments do not re price immediately  renewals may have different terms than original maturities  and the timing of changes for each type of instrument varies for example  core deposit re pricing usually occurs sometime after a change in the federal funds rate  but variable rate loans re price immediately with changes to the company s prime interest rate 
due to the various assumptions used for this simulation analysis  no assurance can be given that actual results will correspond with projected results 
the following table shows the estimated impact on the bank s net interest income over a time horizon of one year from the base case and the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates as of december  for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change in net interest income increase decrease in present value of equity percentage change in present value of equity up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points as of december   management believes the balance sheet was in an asset sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
loans and certificates of deposit represent the majority of interest rate exposure 
historically  savings and interest 
table of contents bearing checking accounts have not re priced in proportion to changes in overall market interest rates 
changes in net interest income can generally be attributed to the balance of loans and certificates of deposit maturing or re pricing 
to reduce the bank s asset sensitive position  the bank entered into an interest rate contract that floors the yield on million of variable rate loans at 
in addition  the bank has entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange variable prime based payments for fixed rate payments ranging from to on million of variable rate loans 
these contracts expire in the change in fair values of financial assets is mainly a result of loans representing of total interest earning assets at december  as a percentage of total loans  million  or approximately  have fixed interest rates  which decline in value during a period of rising interest rates 
while asset liability models have become a main focus of risk management  the company believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling risk 
the quantitative risk information provided is limited by the parameters established in creating the related models 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which the company could take to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected or competitive influences on the company s deposit base 
therefore  the company uses these models only as a supplement to other risk management tools
