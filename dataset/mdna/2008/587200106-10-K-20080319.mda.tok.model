item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and all other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  projections and words of similar meaning  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time  we may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements under outlook for fiscal  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
our business faces many risks  and set forth below are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
we face intense competition in the eda industry 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products  we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results 
any broad based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle certain software products at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could significantly reduce demand for our products or constrain prices we can charge 
we currently compete primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies and compete with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed their own eda products internally 
weakness in the us and international economies may harm our business 
the us and international economies are cyclical and experience periodic economic downturns  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
weakness in these economies could materially adversely impact the timing and receipt of orders for our products and our results of operations 
revenue levels are dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which includes worldwide expenditures for eda software  hardware and consulting services 

table of contents our international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations expose us to additional risks 
we obtain more than half of our revenues from customers outside the us and we generate approximately one third of our expenses outside the us significant changes in currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on us 
for further discussion of foreign currency effects  see effects of foreign currency fluctuations discussion in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  international operations subject us to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  local labor laws  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate 
our revenues  particularly new software license revenues  are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment 
a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled 
the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter attempting to obtain more favorable terms 
our business could be impacted by fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns  the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses and products requested by our customers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control  including customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
we experience seasonality in demand for our products  due to the purchasing cycles of our customers  with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest 
we receive a majority of our software revenues from current quarter order performance  of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
a significant portion of our revenues come from multi million dollar contracts  the timing of the completion of and the terms of delivery of which can have a material impact on revenue for a given quarter 
if we fail to receive expected orders  particularly large orders  our revenues for that quarter could be materially adversely impacted 
in such an event  we could fail to meet investors expectations  which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our revenues are also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where we recognize software revenues as payments become due and payable  on a cash basis  or ratably over the license term as compared to revenues recognized at the beginning of the license term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the license term  for instance  when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable  due and payable and or cash based revenue recognition could result in increased deferral of software revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues  which could result in us not meeting near term revenue expectations 
the gross margin on our software is greater than that for our hardware emulation system  software support and professional services 
therefore  our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
additionally  the gross margin on software varies year to year depending on the amount of royalties due to third parties for the mix of products sold 
we also have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relatively large negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected  our gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from relatively few product groups 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of relatively few product groups and related support services 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycles  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition and economic and market conditions  would likely harm our operating results 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the ic and electronics systems industries 
purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the ic and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles within such companies or a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns can cause diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
customers also appear to be reducing the number of eda vendors with which they do business 
if this trend continues  we may have more difficulty obtaining new customers and increasing our market share 
customer payment defaults could harm our business 
we use fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice with customers we believe are credit worthy 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements are typically three years in length and have payments spread over the license term 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements and disputes 
if we are unable to collect under these agreements  our results of operations could be 
table of contents materially adversely impacted 
we use these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on the terms of the agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change could have a material impact on our results 
ic and pcb technology evolves rapidly 
the complexity of ics and pcbs continues to rapidly increase 
in response to this increasing complexity  new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive 
if we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments  our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive  which could materially adversely impact our business 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased support or service costs 
in addition  we include third party technology in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us 
failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business 
long sales cycles and delay in customer completion of projects make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict 
we have a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and six months 
a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results 
our indirect sales channel is comprised primarily of independent distributors and sales representatives 
our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts 
our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated  if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate  if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken 
any loss of our leadership position in certain segments of the eda market could harm our business 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific segments of the eda market 
for example  one company may enjoy a large percentage of sales in the physical verification segment of the market while another will have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader 
conversely  it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason we lose our leadership position in a niche  we could be materially adversely impacted 
accounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and may change 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition are complex and have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software revenues at the beginning of the license period 
if this trend continues  new and revised standards and interpretations could materially adversely impact our ability to meet near term revenue expectations 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
for example  our interim tax provision expense is based on our expectation of profit and loss by jurisdiction 
if the mix of profit and loss by jurisdiction is different from our estimates our actual tax expense could be materially different 
our tax expense may also be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
also  our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding taxes on term based licenses and related intercompany 
table of contents transactions in certain jurisdictions 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities examinations 
the irs and tax authorities in countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we were issued a revenue agent s report in march see provision for income taxes in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion 
forecasting our tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty as our tax position for each year combines i the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  ii changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  iii the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and iv changes in the tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
in order to forecast our global tax rate  we estimate pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction and calculate tax expense by jurisdiction 
if the mix of profits and losses or effective tax rates by jurisdiction are different than those estimates  our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecast 
there are limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 
we may not realize revenues as a result of our investments in research and development 
we incur substantial expense to develop new software products 
research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time 
this effort may not yield a successful product offering or the product may not satisfy customer requirements 
as a result  we could realize little or no revenues related to our investment in research and development 
we may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them 
the industry in which we compete has seen significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  we have acquired numerous businesses and have frequently been in discussions with potential acquisition candidates  and we may acquire other businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could materially adversely impact us difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of previously unknown liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and increases in revenues  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  unanticipated litigation in connection with or as a result of an acquisition  including claims from terminated employees  customers or third parties  adverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors could impair our ability to forecast  meet revenues and earnings targets and manage effectively our business for long term growth 
we cannot assure that we can effectively meet these challenges 
mergers of our customers appear to be increasing 
a significant number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and we believe more are likely 
mergers of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services  and in some cases  increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers  including us 
supply problems for our emulation hardware systems could harm our business 
the success of our emulation hardware systems depends on our ability to i procure hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  ii create stable software for use on the product  iii assemble and ship hardware and software systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  iv develop distribution and shipment processes  v manage inventory and related obsolescence issues and vi develop processes to deliver customer support for hardware 
our inability to be successful in any of the foregoing could materially adversely impact us 
we generally commit to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of our emulation hardware system 
if we cannot change or be released from these non cancelable purchase commitments  and if orders for our products do not materialize  we 
table of contents could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before we could use them 
additionally  a delay in production of the components or inaccuracy in our sales forecast could materially adversely impact our operating results if we are unable to timely ship ordered products or provide replacement parts under warranty or maintenance contracts 
we may not adequately protect our proprietary rights or we may fail to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the us some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 
litigation may materially adversely impact us 
litigation may result in monetary damages  injunctions against future product sales and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely impact us 
third parties may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights 
we periodically receive notices from others claiming infringement  or other misuse of their intellectual property rights or breach of our agreements with them 
we expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products overlap  the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the software industry and the volume of issued software patents continues to increase 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming  costly and or result in litigation  divert management s time and attention from developing our business  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products  require us to release source code to third parties  possibly under open source license terms  require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers  or otherwise adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely impact the markets on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and investment in our business 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel more difficult and expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
any armed conflict entered into by the us could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result from an armed conflict and could negatively impact our business 
we currently have operations in pakistan  egypt and israel  countries that may be particularly susceptible to this risk 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse impact on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the us or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and could result in volatility of the market price for our common stock 
our articles of incorporation  oregon law and our shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has the authority  without action by the shareholders  to designate and issue up to  shares of incentive stock in one or more series and to designate the rights  preferences and privileges of each series without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
additionally  the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
in february  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  which has the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
the potential issuance of incentive stock  the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act and our shareholder rights plan could have the effect of delaying  deferring or 
table of contents preventing a change of control of us  could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of january   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures floating rate debentures due  million of convertible subordinated debentures debentures due and million in short term borrowings 
this level of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the floating rate debentures and debentures  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenues  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price could become more volatile  and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

we believe that we will be able to renew or replace our existing leases as they expire and that our current facilities will be adequate through at least the year ending january  item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise from the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits relating to intellectual property rights  licensing  contracts and employee relations matters 
we believe that the outcome of current litigation  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

on july   we changed our fiscal year to january from december  effective for the year ended january  we believe that the twelve months ended december  and provide a meaningful comparison to the twelve months ended january  there are no factors  of which we are aware  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends  if results for the twelve months ended january  and were presented in lieu of results for the twelve months ended december  and references to fiscal represent the twelve months ended january  references to and represent the twelve months ended december  and business environment business during the year ended january  continued to build on the growth that occurred during  with bookings up compared to the year ended december   led by growth in ic design to silicon and new and emerging products 
bookings are the value of 
table of contents executed orders during a period for which revenue has been or will be recognized within six months for products and within twelve months for professional services and training 
the ten largest transactions for the fourth quarter of fiscal accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings compared to for the fourth quarter of the ten largest transactions for the year ended january  accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings compared to for the year ended december  the number of new customers during the three months ended january  was down from the three months ended december  while the number of new customers for the year ended january  was higher than the year ended december  during the three months ended january   we experienced a increase in system and software revenues compared to the three months ended december  for the year ended january   system and software revenues increased from the year ended december  we believe fiscal will bring overall growth in the eda industry 
for the past two years the eda industry has experienced significant revenue growth 
early economic indicators suggest that the growth will be more moderate as we look to fiscal we believe that we are well positioned among our competitors to continue our trend of growing at  or above  eda market growth rates 
we will continue our strategy of developing high quality tools with number one market share potential  rather than being a broad line supplier with undifferentiated product offerings 
this strategy allows us to focus investment in areas where customer s needs are greatest and we have the opportunity to build significant market share 
license model mix license model trends can have a material impact on various aspects of our business 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item for a description of the types of product licenses we sell 
as the mix shifts among perpetual licenses  fixed term licenses term with upfront revenue recognition and term licenses with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable and cash based revenue recognition  revenues  earnings  cash flow and days sales outstanding dso are either positively or negatively affected 
the year ended january  marked the seventh consecutive year in which  as a percentage of product revenue  term revenue increased while perpetual license revenue decreased  and we believe this trend will continue through fiscal our customers continue to move toward the term license model  which provides them with greater flexibility for product usage  including the option to share products between multiple locations and remix tool use at regular intervals from a fixed product list 
as such  most of our customers have converted their existing installed base from perpetual to term licenses 
as a result of the ongoing shift from perpetual licenses to term licenses with upfront revenue recognition  we expect no significant impact to earnings  but a negative impact on cash flow and dso  as term licenses are generally paid over time 
as customers move away from perpetual licenses and into term licenses  the renewability and repeatability of our business is increased 
this provides opportunity for increased distribution of products earlier in their lifecycles 
product developments during the year ended january   we continued to execute our strategy of focusing on new problem areas encountered by customers  as well as building upon our well established product families 
we believe that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges in creating new products  generally choose the best eda products in each category to build their design environment 
through both internal development and strategic acquisitions  we have focused on areas where we believe we can build a leading market position or extend an existing leading market position 
during the year ended january   we launched many new or improved products  which are chronologically listed below first quarter in february  we announced the release of board station xe  the next generation version of our board station design flow for large enterprise customers 
in march  we announced a technology launch of subsystem intellectual property 
in april  we formally launched the veloce product family  consisting of three new next generation hardware assisted verification platforms 
the veloce solo  trio and quattro products each deliver emulation capability for concurrent hardware software validation and embedded system verification for vertical markets such as multimedia graphics  computing  networking and wireless designs 
second quarter in may  we announced the latest release of the in clock domain crossing and formal verification products  which help find critical design bugs 
also in may  we enhanced the questa functional verification platform 
in june  we acquired sierra design automation  inc  a leading provider of high performance place and route solutions for integrated circuits 
sierra s flagship product  olympus soc provides a next generation place and route system that concurrently addresses variations in manufacturing and allows designers to simultaneously solve for large numbers of variables to achieve a more optimal design 
in july  we announced the latest release of the chs product suite  our flagship product supporting vehicle electrical system design and wire harness engineering 
third quarter in august  we announced jointly with cadence design systems  inc  a verification methodology standard based on the institute of electric and electronic engineers standard language systemverilog 
we contributed  along with cadence  technology and resources to develop the open verification methodology ovm  which offers both design and verification engineers a tool independent solution with data portability and interoperability 
in september  we announced precision rtl plus syntheses  which provides an improved method of designing field programmable gate arrays 
in october  we announced new technology in our testkompress product 
the new xpress technology assists integrated circuit manufacturers to meet quality goals at nm process nodes while helping to control testing costs 

table of contents fourth quarter in december  we announced our first multi mode  multi corner signal integrity solution for nm 
the new technology in our olympus soc place and route product accelerates signal integrity closure and improves the reliability of manufactured silicon 
olympus soc is well positioned to handle integrated circuit challenges at nm and below because of its unique multi mode  multi corner capabilities 
olympus soc is particularly appealing to companies tasked with challenges of graphics  multimedia and multiprocessors 
in january  we announced our next generation testbench xpress tbx when used in conjunction with our veloce family of hardware emulators  the tbx tool provides a software based  cost effective and efficient way to perform hardware software co verification for embedded systems 
we believe that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is usually a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long 
we believe that our relatively young and diverse product lines are positioned for growth over the long term 
financial performance for the year ended january  total revenues were  a increase over the year ended december   due to strength in ic design to silicon and new and emerging markets 
growth in ic design to silicon for the year ended january  was led by our calibre product family as well as our new olympus soc place and route product 
new and emerging markets growth was led by our design for test family of products 
finance fee revenues were  a increase over the year ended december  system and software revenues were  an increase over the year ended december  product revenue split by license model was term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition  which includes due and payable and cash based revenue recognition  compared to the year ended december  product splits of term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition 
service and support revenues were  a increase over the year ended december  net income for the year ended january  was  compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  improvement in earnings for the year resulted from growth in revenues during the year 
trade accounts receivable  net increased to  at january   up from  at december  average days sales outstanding increased to days at january  from days at december  cash generated from operating activities was  during the year ended january  compared to  during the year ended december  at january   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  down from  at december  critical accounting policies we base our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting for revenue recognition  valuation of trade accounts receivable  valuation of deferred tax assets  income tax reserves  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  restructuring charges and accounting for stock based compensation are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we report revenue in two categories based upon how the revenue is generated i system and software and ii service and support 
system and software revenues we derive system and software revenues from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware systems and finance fee revenues from our long term installment receivables resulting from product sales 
we primarily license our products using two different license types term licenses this license type is primarily used for software sales and provides the customer with a right to use a fixed list of software products for a specified time period  typically three years  with payments spread over the license term  and does not provide the customer with the right to use the products after the end of the term 
term license arrangements may allow the customer to share products between multiple locations and remix product usage from the fixed list of delivered products at regular intervals during the license term 
we generally recognize product revenue from term license arrangements upon product delivery and start of the license term 
in a term license agreement where we provide the customer with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products  we recognize revenue ratably over the license term 
revenue from emulation product sales where the software is incidental to the hardware is generally recognized upon delivery 
perpetual licenses we use this license type for software and emulation hardware system sales 
this license type provides the customer with the right to use the product in perpetuity and typically does not provide for extended payment terms 
we generally recognize product revenue from perpetual license arrangements upon product delivery assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we include finance fee revenues from the accretion on the discount of long term installment receivables in system and software revenues 
finance fee revenues were  for fiscal   for and  for 
table of contents service and support revenues service and support revenues consist of revenues from software and hardware post contract maintenance or support services and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
we recognize revenue ratably over the support services term 
we record professional service revenue as the services are provided to the customer 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all software and product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental 
we determine whether product revenue recognition is appropriate based upon the evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally  we use either a customer signed contract or qualified customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for term licenses and perpetual licenses 
for professional service engagements  we generally use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery has occurred we generally deliver software and the corresponding access keys to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software 
we may also deliver the software on a compact disc 
our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
with respect to emulation hardware  we transfer title to the customer upon shipment 
we offer non essential installation services for emulation hardware sales or the customer may elect to perform the installation without assistance from us 
our emulation hardware system agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract with installment terms without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
additionally  for installment contracts  we determine that the fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has a payment schedule that is within the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments  when evaluated on a cumulative basis 
if the fee is not deemed to be fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review process 
we typically sell to customers with whom there is a history of successful collection 
we evaluate the financial position and a customer s ability to pay whenever an existing customer purchases new products  renews an existing arrangement or requests an increase in credit terms 
for certain industries for which our products are not considered core to the industry or the industry is generally considered troubled  we impose higher credit standards 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
multiple element arrangements for multiple element arrangements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and non essential undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if undelivered elements of the arrangement are essential to the functionality of the product  we defer revenue until the essential elements are delivered 
if vsoe does not exist for one or more non essential undelivered elements  we defer revenue until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if vsoe of all non essential undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  we defer revenue related to the undelivered elements based upon vsoe and we recognize the remaining portion of the arrangement fee as revenue for the delivered elements  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
if we could no longer establish vsoe for non essential undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements  we would defer revenue until all elements are delivered or vsoe is established for the undelivered elements  whichever is earlier 
we base our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
we primarily base our vsoe for term and perpetual support services upon customer renewal history where the services are sold separately 
we also base vsoe for professional services and installation services for emulation hardware systems upon the price charged when the services are sold separately 
valuation of trade accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and term receivables  long term  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customers  the current business environment and historical experience 
current economic conditions we have considered include forecasted spending in the semiconductor industry  consumer spending for electronics  ic research and development spending and the current growth in gross domestic product 
if these factors change or circumstances related to specific customers change  we adjust the estimates of the recoverability of receivables resulting in either additional selling expense or a reduction in selling expense in the period such determination was made 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unspecified reserves for bad debt based on trends in our historical experience and the current business environment 
this resulted in a reduction in selling expenses of  for the year ended january  valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning 
table of contents strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or decrease goodwill in the period such determination was made 
also  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
income tax reserves we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions  and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we were issued a revenue agent s report in march see provision for income taxes discussion in this item for additional discussion 
effective february   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under this interpretation  we recognize a tax position when we determine that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained  we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized when it is ultimately settled 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition with respect to tax positions 
we reflect interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we review long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we determine recoverability of an asset by comparing its carrying amount to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if we determine the operation is unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  we write down the long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  we determine that our goodwill  intangible or other long lived assets have been impaired  we would make an adjustment that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
special charges we have recorded restructuring charges within special charges in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with our plans to better align our cost structure with projected operations in the future 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred 
we have recorded restructuring charges in connection with employee rebalances based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance benefits 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an addition to special charges will be recognized 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
we have also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities to offset future rent  net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained 
additionally  we also write off leasehold improvements on abandoned office space 
we work with external real estate experts in each of the markets where properties are located to develop assumptions used to determine a reasonable estimate of the net loss 
our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the local real estate market 
if the real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  an addition to special charges will be recognized in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
accounting for stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees for services 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period 
for options and stock awards that vest fully on any termination of service  there is no requisite service period and consequently we recognize the expense fully in the period in which the award is granted 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plans in accordance with sfas r using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates several highly subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and interest rates 
we include the following elements in reaching our determination of expected volatility i historical volatility of our shares of common stock  ii historical volatility of shares of comparable companies  iii implied volatility of the option features in our convertible subordinated debentures and iv implied volatility of traded options of comparable companies 
the expected term of our stock options is based on historical experience 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact the results of operations in the period such changes are made 

table of contents recent acquisitions on june   we acquired of the common stock of sierra design automation  inc sierra  a privately held company based in santa clara  california  which is a provider of high performance place and route software solutions 
the acquisition was an investment aimed at expanding our design for manufacturing capabilities and increasing revenue growth 
upon completion of the merger transaction  the outstanding shares of sierra were converted into the right to receive consideration from us totaling  of which  was payable in cash and  was payable in the form of  shares of our common stock valued as provided in the merger agreement at per share which was the average closing price reported by nasdaq for the trading day period ending three days before the closing 
cash of  and shares of our common stock with a value of  were withheld pro rata from the former sierra shareholders and deposited in an indemnity escrow account 
these amounts are subject to standard representations and warranties and will generally be released in october if no claims of indemnification have been made by us 
the indemnity escrow account also includes of cash and shares of our common stock valued at withheld from sierra s two founders  these amounts plus an additional shares of our common stock valued at  withheld from the founders are subject to forfeiture if their employment with us is terminated by them without good reason or by us for cause before june  in accounting for the sierra transaction  we are required to value the shares of our common stock issued in the transaction at per share which was the average closing price reported by nasdaq for the five day period beginning with the two day period preceding the measurement date through the two days succeeding the measurement date 
in addition  the cash and common stock withheld from the two sierra founders of  which is subject to a continued employment requirement  is considered compensation expense to be recognized over the service period and is not included in the acquisition cost 
the common stock withheld from the two sierra founders was valued at per share 
after this adjustment  the total purchase price of sierra  including transaction costs  was  the excess of tangible assets acquired over liabilities assumed was  including  of acquired cash 
we allocated the cost of the acquisition on the basis of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the purchase accounting allocations resulted in a charge for in process research and development of  goodwill of  technology of  other identified intangible assets of  and deferred tax assets of  we are amortizing the technology to cost of revenues and the other identified intangible assets to operating expenses over three years 
of the in transaction costs we recorded  were paid by july   and the remaining were paid by october  the results of sierra s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition forward 
in march  we acquired the technology of dynamic soft analysis  inc  a privately held company based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania that is a provider of betasoft thermal analysis software 
we are integrating the acquired technology into our systems design division product offerings 
the total purchase price  including acquisition costs  was the excess of tangible assets acquired over liabilities assumed was we allocated the cost of the acquisition on the basis of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the purchase accounting allocations resulted in goodwill of  technology of and other identified intangible assets of we are amortizing the technology to cost of revenues and the other identified intangible assets to operating expenses over three years 
for many of our acquisitions  payment of a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon the acquired business achievement of certain revenue and product performance goals 
these contingent payments  or earn outs  are accrued when the performance goals are met and the contingent consideration is issued or issuable 
we recorded earn outs of  during the year ended january    for and  for  based on related revenues derived from products and technologies acquired in current and prior year s acquisitions 
we made earn out payments of  during the year ended january    for and  for we used an independent third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the allocation of the purchase price of these acquisitions 
change in fiscal year on july   we changed our fiscal year to january  from december  effective for the year ending january  this report includes the financial information for the transition period from january to january  we believe that the twelve months ended december  and provide a meaningful comparison to the twelve months ended january  there are no factors  of which we are aware  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends  if results for the twelve months ended january  and were presented in lieu of results for the twelve months ended december  and references in this document to fiscal represent the twelve months ended january  references to and represent the twelve months ended december  and we did not experience a significant amount of business activity or product shipment in january and have reported a loss for that period 
the low level of business activity and product shipment resulted in part from the historical pattern of low levels of business activity in january  and in part because we did not implement significant sales incentive compensation programs for that one month period 
results of operations revenues and gross margins year ended january  change december  change december  system and software revenues system and software gross margins gross margin percent service and support revenues service and support gross margins gross margin percent total revenues total gross margins gross margin percent system and software revenues we derive system and software revenues from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware systems 
system and software revenues were higher for the year ended january  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increases in the following areas i ic design to silicon  led by our 
table of contents calibre product family and our new olympus soc place and route product and ii new and emerging markets  lead by our design for test products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues in the following products i our modelsim products and ii our embedded systems products 
these declines were primarily due to the timing of renewals on certain large deals 
these gains were minimally affected by foreign currency fluctuations during the year ended january   as more fully described under geographic revenues information below 
system and software revenues were higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increases in the following areas i scalable verification  led by our modelsim products  ii integrated system design  led by our printed circuit board pcb products  iii ic design to silicon  led by our calibre product family  and iv new and emerging markets  led by our embedded systems products 
during the year ended january   system and software revenues exceeded system and software bookings 
accordingly  our backlog of firm orders decreased from  as of december  to  as of january  system and software revenues include finance fee revenues for the amortization of the interest component of our term license installment agreements of  for the year ended january  as compared to  for and  for the increase in finance fee revenues related to term license installment agreements was primarily due to the increase in the average interest rates applied in determining the interest component for the outstanding term agreements during the applicable periods and growth in term licensing installment agreements 
system and software gross margin percentage was flat for the year ended january  compared to the year ended december  as cost of revenues moved in line with revenues 
system and software gross margins were higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased revenues  without a corresponding increase in costs 
the write down of emulation hardware systems inventory was  for the year ended january  compared to  for and  for these reserves reduced inventory to the amount that was expected to ship within twelve months for our newly released veloce emulation hardware systems and six months for all other inventory on the assumption that any excess would be obsolete 
amortization of purchased technology to system and software cost of revenues was  for the year ended january  as compared to  for and  for we amortize purchased technology costs over two to five years to system and software cost of revenues 
the decrease in amortization for the year ended january  was primarily due to certain assets being fully amortized during the fiscal year 
the decrease was partially offset by amortization during the year ended january  of certain intangible assets acquired during the year and a full year of amortization of four technology acquisitions completed in the year ended december  the amortization for the year ended january  included amortization of purchased technology resulting from the sierra design automation  inc acquisition which occurred in june the increase in amortization in the year ended december  was primarily due to four technology acquisitions during the year  a full year of amortization related to three technology acquisitions completed during the year ended december  and the initiation of amortization of two purchased technology assets 
the increase was partially offset by certain assets being fully amortized during the fiscal year 
exclusive of future acquisitions  amortization of purchased technology will decrease in fiscal primarily due to the complete amortization of purchased technology related to one technology acquisition during the year ended december  and one technology acquisition completed during the year ended december   partially offset by a full year of amortization related to two technology acquisitions during the year ended january  service and support revenues service and support revenues consist of revenues from software and hardware post contract maintenance or support services and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
the increase in service and support revenues for the year ended january  compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from growth in the installed base of customers under support contracts  specifically in scalable verification and ic design to silicon  led by the in  calibre and extraction products 
additionally  we had growth in support revenues from new and emerging markets  specifically in the electronic system level group  and integrated system design  specifically in our pads products 
due to our acquisition of sierra design automation  inc  our new olympus soc place and route product has contributed to our increased revenues for the year ended january  we also experienced increased consulting revenues 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by declining revenues in our older emulation products 
the overall increases in service and support revenues were minimally affected by foreign currency fluctuations during the year ended january   as more fully described under geographic revenues information below 
service and support revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the growth in the installed base of customers under support contracts 
professional service revenues totaled  for the year ended january  as compared to  for and  for the service and support gross margin percentage declined for the year ended january  this was primarily due to declining revenues and increasing costs in emulation hardware system support 
costs associated with emulation hardware system support have increased as a result of additional support needed for our newly released veloce emulation hardware systems 
additionally  we had increasing costs in embedded systems consulting due to new projects undertaken in the year ended january  that have revenue deferred until completion 
service and support gross margins remained flat in the year ended december  primarily due to strong growth in support revenue and corresponding increases in support costs of goods sold

effects of foreign currency fluctuations we generated approximately half of our revenues and approximately one third of our expenses outside of the us during the year ended january  for the years ended january  and december  and  approximately one fourth of european and substantially all japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were booked in local currencies 
most large european revenue contracts are denominated and paid to us in the us dollar while our european expenses  including substantial research and development operations  are paid in local currencies causing a short position in the euro and the british pound 
in addition  we experience greater inflows than outflows of japanese yen as almost all japanese based customers contract and pay us in local currency 
while these exposures are aggregated on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets  substantial exposure remains 
for exposures that are not offset  we enter into short term foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset these anticipated exposures 
the option contracts are generally entered into at contract strike rates that are different than current market rates 
as a result  any unfavorable currency 
table of contents movements below the strike rates will not be offset by the foreign currency option contract and could negatively affect operating results 
these contracts address anticipated future cash flows for periods up to one year and do not hedge of the potential exposures related to these currencies 
as a result  the effects of currency fluctuations could have a substantial effect on our overall results of operations 
we discontinued certain hedges of japanese yen revenues during because it was probable that a portion of the original forecasted transactions would not occur 
as a result  we recognized a gain on hedge ineffectiveness of  we also reclassified a net loss of from accumulated other comprehensive income to hedge ineffectiveness for hedged transactions that failed to occur 
additionally  we determined that certain of our remaining derivative instruments did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment under the requirements of sfas resulting in the instruments being marked to market through the consolidated statement of operations as a net realized loss of  for and a net unrealized gain of  for foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income reported in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  increased to  at january  from  at december  this increase reflects the increase in the value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies as a result of the weakening of the us dollar since december  provision for income taxes year ended january  change december  change december  provision for income taxes in the year ended january   our income before income taxes of  consisted of  of pre tax income in the united states and  of foreign pre tax income 
generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  withholding taxes primarily in certain foreign jurisdictions and changes in tax reserves 
deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  credit carryovers and timing differences between book and tax income 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended january  at a percent effective tax rate differs from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to i withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions  ii increases in foreign tax reserves  iii nondeductible incentive stock options  employee stock purchase plans and other executive compensation expense and iv nondeductible in process research and development  offset in part by the benefit of lower tax rates on earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
we have not provided for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered permanently re invested outside of the us as of january   the cumulative amount of earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided is approximately  after consideration of favorable currency movements 
upon repatriation  some of these earnings would generate foreign tax credits  which may reduce the federal tax liability associated with any future foreign dividend 
as of january   for federal income tax purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  foreign tax credits of  research and experimentation credit carryforwards of  alternative minimum tax credits of  and child care credits of as of january   for state income tax purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling  from multiple jurisdictions and research and experimentation and other miscellaneous state credits of  portions of our loss carryforwards  inherited through various acquisitions  are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
if not used to reduce united states taxable income in future periods  portions of the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the fiscal years ending january  through  the foreign tax credits will expire in fiscal years ending through  research and experimentation credit carryforwards will expire between fiscal years ending through and child care credits will expire between fiscal years ending and the alternative minimum tax credits do not expire 
as of january   we have net operating losses in multiple foreign jurisdictions of  in general  the net operating losses for these foreign jurisdictions can be carried forward indefinitely 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we determined deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect differences to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
since  we have determined it is uncertain whether our us entities will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards  research and experimentation credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards before expiration 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances in  and fiscal against the portion of those deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
a portion of the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets relates to certain of the tax attributes acquired from ikos systems  inc in  in design automation  inc 
in  and sierra design automation  inc sierra in fiscal  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to reduce goodwill 
valuation allowances relating to non us taxing jurisdictions were based on the historical earnings patterns which indicated uncertainty that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis 
net deferred tax assets of  at january   reflected a net increase of when compared with the  balance as of december  gross assets increased by  as we built credits and recorded the tax effect of stock based compensation expense under sfas r  offset by the utilization of net operating losses and reduction in accrued expense 
the increase in gross assets was offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities of  which was primarily attributed to the acquisition of sierra  net of a reduction in valuation allowances of  
table of contents net operating loss carryforwards created by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options are not recorded as deferred tax assets 
if and when such net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  stockholders equity will be increased 
for presentation purposes  we have also elected to exclude the historic deferred tax assets related to the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards have been reduced by  as of january  and  as of december  since the deferred tax assets created by stock based compensation are fully offset with valuation allowances  there were no changes to our deferred tax provision for any years presented 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions in the ordinary course of business and  as a result  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the statute of limitations for adjustments to our historic tax obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
in some cases it may be extended or be unlimited 
further  attribute carryforwards may be subject to adjustment after the expiration of the statute of limitations of the year such attribute was originated 
our larger jurisdictions generally provide for a statute of limitation from three to five years 
in the us  the statute of limitation remains open for fiscal years and forward 
we are currently under examination in various jurisdictions  including the us the examinations are in different stages and timing of their resolution is difficult to predict 
the examination in the us by the internal revenue service irs pertains to our    and tax years 
in march  the irs issued a revenue agent s report for through in which adjustments were asserted totaling  of additional taxable income 
the adjustments primarily concern transfer pricing arrangements related to intellectual property rights acquired in acquisitions which were transferred to a foreign subsidiary 
we disagree with the irs s adjustments and continue to vigorously defend our position 
in ireland and japan  our statute of limitations remains open for years on and after and  respectively 
we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that are being challenged or that could be challenged by taxing authorities even though we believe that the positions we have taken are appropriate 
we believe our tax reserves are adequate to cover potential liabilities 
we reviewed the tax reserves as circumstances warranted and adjusted the reserves as events occurred that affected our potential liability for additional taxes 
it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter 
various events  some of which can not be predicted  may occur that would affect our reserves and effective tax rate 
we may continue to build reserves  consistent with past years  however  it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax positions may decrease by up to  due to settlements or expiration of the statute of limitations within the next twelve months 
certain reductions in our reserves may require cash payments 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources in this item for additional discussion 
to the extent such uncertain tax positions resolve in our favor  it would have positive impacts on our effective tax rate 
accrued income tax related interest and penalties were  for the year ended january  on february   we adopted fin the adoption of fin did not have a cumulative effect on our retained earnings 
as of january  and february   respectively  the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax position was  and  and tax benefits which could offset this liability were  and  such offsetting tax benefits consider the correlative effects of deductible interest and state income tax  and other deductible tax adjustments 
we expect uncertain tax positions of  if recognized  would favorably affect our effective tax rate  whereas the recognition of other uncertain tax position could result in reductions to goodwill or an increase in deferred tax assets being subject to valuation allowances 
as part of the adoption of fin  we reclassified  from income taxes payable to other long term liabilities 
as of january   and  of reserve for taxes was reflected as income tax payable and other long term liabilities  respectively

once we begin recognizing revenue on a term deal  deferred revenue cannot be netted against term receivables  short term 
we begin recognizing revenue in january on calendar year deals which results in a greater amount of term receivables  short term  being presented as of january  compared to december  for receivables that have not commenced revenue recognition  we offset the receivable against the corresponding deferred revenue until the first month we recognized revenues 
additionally  we have experienced more accelerated billing terms on some new agreements in certain quarters driving more receivables into short term as some customers are favoring shorter terms for billing cycles 
in quarters where term contract revenue is recorded  only the first twelve months of the receivable is reflected in current trade accounts receivable 
in the following quarters  we reflect the amount due in the next twelve months in current trade accounts receivable without the corresponding revenue 
as a result  if our mix of contracts were to shift to a higher percentage of term contracts  we would expect average days sales outstanding to increase 
term receivables  long term term receivables  long term decreased to  at january  from  at december  the balances were attributable to multi year term license sales agreements 
we include amounts for term agreements that are due within one year in trade accounts receivable  net and balances that are due in more than one year in term receivables  long term 
we use term agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
the decrease from resulted from the change in our fiscal year end 
customer contracts continue to be based on calendar quarters and the shift in our fiscal year end has caused a portion of our term receivables  which would have otherwise stayed long term  to be classified as short term receivables 
the decrease was also due to accelerated billing terms on some new agreements driving more receivables into short term as some customers are favoring shorter terms for billing cycles 
finally  there were several customer receivable balances due within three to five years which were paid in full during the year ended january   leading to an immediate reduction of long term receivables 

table of contents property  plant and equipment  net as of january  december  property  plant and equipment  net the increase in property  plant and equipment  net was due to normal capital purchases  offset by depreciation and disposals 
the increase in property  plant and equipment for the year ended january  did not include any individually significant projects and was primarily due to infrastructure improvements within facilities and information technology 
accrued payroll and related liabilities as of january  december  accrued payroll and related liabilities the decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities reflected lower bonus and commission accruals for the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  additionally  the balance as of january  includes only one month of employee stock purchase plan withholdings compared to six months of withholdings as of december  purchases for the employee stock purchase plan occur in january and july of each year 
the decrease in withholding is strictly related to our change in fiscal year end and the timing of purchases 
deferred revenue as of january  december  deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of prepaid annual software support services 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due i an increase in term support contracts for fiscal as well as annual billings on existing arrangements and ii the change in fiscal year end 
the change in fiscal year end reduced the amount of deferred revenue which could be netted against term receivables  short term 
once we begin recognizing revenue on a term license arrangement  deferred revenue cannot be netted against term receivables  short term 
we begin recognizing revenue in january on calendar year deals which results in a greater amount of deferred revenue being presented as of january  compared to december  this was partially offset by normal amortization of prepayments on existing contracts 
the increase from december  was also attributed in part to the change in fiscal year end 
renewal of customer contracts which would have occurred in the first month of the calendar year quarter moved into the last month of our fiscal quarter 
income taxes as of january   we have a liability of  for income taxes associated with uncertain income tax positions 
of these liabilities   are classified as long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  as we generally do not anticipate the settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  certain liabilities may result in the reduction of deferred tax assets rather than settlement in cash 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
capital resources expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased to  for the year ended january  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expenditures for property  plant and equipment was a result of expected infrastructure improvements within facilities and information technology
