executive summary we are a leading seismic solutions company  providing the global oil and natural gas industry with a variety of seismic products and services  including land and marine seismic data acquisition equipment  survey design planning services  software products  seismic data libraries  and seismic data processing services 
in recent years  we have transformed our business from being solely a seismic equipment manufacturer to being a provider of a full range of seismic imaging products and services including designing and planning a seismic survey  overseeing the acquisition of seismic data by seismic contractors  and processing the acquired seismic data using advanced algorithms and mode workflows 
we operate our company through four business segments three of these segments land imaging systems  marine imaging systems and data management solutions make up our ion systems division  and the fourth segment is our ion solutions division formerly referred to as seismic imaging solutions 
our current growth strategy is focused on the following key areas expanding our ion solutions business in new regions with new customers and with new service offerings  including proprietary services for owners and operators of oil and gas properties  globalizing our ion solutions data processing business by opening advanced imaging centers in new locations  and expanding our presence in the land seismic processing segment  successfully developing and introducing our next generation of marine towed streamer products  expanding our seabed imaging solutions business using our vectorseis ocean vso acquisition platform and derivative products  increasing our market share in cable based land acquisition systems through our new scorpion acquisition system  and ongoing development and further commercialization of firefly  our cableless full wave land acquisition system 
in september  we changed our corporate name from input output  inc to ion geophysical corporation 
this change was made to reflect the evolution of our company from being primarily known as an 
table of contents equipment manufacturer to our broader  current product and service portfolio of land and marine acquisition hardware  survey design and command and control software  advanced imaging service and seismic data libraries 
we are currently in the process of consolidating our international sales under a new entity operating in dubai 
dubai is geographically better positioned to ensure that we are close to our customers in the most active oil and gas centers of the world 
over time  our dubai operations will be expanded and established as our international headquarters for that part of the world 
associated with this change will be a more effective tax structure that better reflects our global operations and better operational efficiencies for our international customers 
during the year ended december   we continued to see interest in our new technologies 
for example in the fourth quarter of  we delivered our new firefly cableless full wave land acquisition system to seismic equipment solutions lp for use by bp america production company  a subsidiary of london based bp plc  for a first field application project in wyoming 
in march  apache corporation began their deployment of this system at a project located in northeast texas  the survey was completed in june and results are currently being assessed 
in the first quarter of  we recognized revenues of million associated with this system sale  which was used on both the surveys in wyoming and northeast texas 
firefly version is in the final development stage with target release in during february  we announced the receipt of an order for approximately million from rxt  a marine seismic contractor headquartered in oslo  norway  for a fourth vso redeployable ocean bottom cable system 
this system was delivered in the fourth quarter of in addition  in may  we entered into a multi year agreement with rxt under which rxt has agreed to purchase a minimum of million in vso systems and related equipment over the next four years 
this agreement entitles us to receive a royalty of of revenues generated by rxt through the use of all vso equipment from january through the term of the agreement 
in turn  this agreement allows rxt to have exclusive rights to this product line through during  we delivered all of the land acquisition systems to ongc  the national oil company of india  resulting in approximately million of revenues during the year 
in the third quarter of  we completed open water testing of our digifin advanced streamer command and control system with our launch partner  pgs  resulting in pgs placing an order to outfit a vessel with digifin  which we delivered during that quarter 
on june   we entered into a series of agreements with hydro technology ventures and reservoir innovation as for the formation of a joint venture company named octio geophysical as for the purpose of developing  pilot testing and commercializing a full wave seismic system for permanent monitoring of offshore reservoirs 
hydro technology is a subsidiary of statoilhydro asa 
reservoir innovation is a privately held company based in bergen  norway  that develops and commercializes technologies for the exploration  development  and production of offshore hydrocarbon reservoirs 
each party to the joint venture has equal operational control over the joint venture company 
under the terms of the agreement  we contributed licensed certain of our technology to the joint venture and agreed to sell certain products and to provide temporary employee support to the joint venture 
in the fourth quarter of  we delivered a full wave digital scorpion system to a customer in china 
this sale involved a very large vectorseis based scorpion land acquisition system with over  digital sensor stations 
we believe the large scale of this system deployment further validates the merits of our full wave imaging technology and how it can be utilized to bring high fidelity imaging to difficult subsurface reservoirs 
each of our four operating business segments experienced strong percentage increases in their revenues compared to their revenues for the comparable periods in and our total net revenues of 
table of contents million for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to fiscal  principally due to increased activity and demand for seismic services 
overall  income from operations for the year ended december  was approximately higher compared to income from operations for fiscal  although our ion solutions division experienced lower operating income in compared to due to the more lower margin sales mix of its net revenues  particularly the margins on a one time seismic data library sale 
our gross margin percentage was in  in and in in march  we obtained a million revolving line of credit replacing our previously available million revolving line of credit 
the only indebtedness outstanding under this facility at december  was million with respect to outstanding letters of credit 
on february   we amended this facility 
in addition  in december and february  we completed the sale of  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  respectively  for an aggregate consideration of million 
the sales were made in connection with the preferred stockholder s exercise of rights to acquire additional shares of our preferred stock under a february agreement between our company and the stockholder 
see discussion below of the terms of this credit facility and these sales of preferred stock at liquidity and capital resources 
in november  a holder of million of our convertible senior notes approached us and made an offer to convert its notes into common stock 
the conversion occurred on november   and we paid a one time charge of million  which represented the net present value of the remaining interest payments until the note s maturity in december the remaining million balance remains outstanding on our convertible senior notes 
the following table provides an overview of the key financial metrics for our company as a whole and our four business segments during the years ended december   and

we intend that the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows will provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
for a discussion of factors that could impact our future operating results and financial condition  see item a 
risk factors above 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  increased million  compared to the corresponding period last year  principally due to increased activity and demand for seismic services 
land imaging systems net revenues increased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to an increase in sales of our land acquisition systems  including the sale of land acquisition systems to ongc  the recognition of our firefly sale in the first quarter of and significantly increased vibrator truck sales compared to marine imaging systems net revenues increased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december  principally due to stronger sales of our marine positioning products  including the first sale of our digifin advanced streamer command and control system  greater demand for our digicourse positioning and source products and an increase in vectorseis ocean vso and source product sales 
we delivered to rxt the fourth vso system in december and expect to begin delivering the next vso system in our data management solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in this increase primarily reflects increased energy industry demand for marine seismic work and sales from our newly launched orca towed streamer navigation and data management applications product line 
ion solutions seismic imaging solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in this increase was due to larger demand related to higher proprietary processing revenues  pre funded multi client seismic surveys primarily off the coasts of alaska  africa and indonesia and sales of off the shelf seismic data sales 
sales showed significant improvement compared to  which included a one time  million multi client seismic library sale that was not duplicated in gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the reduction in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to the recognition of the sale in of our first firefly system which  as a newly developed system  had relatively high built in costs of sale and the mix of business  including an increase in sales of lower margin vibroseis trucks by land imaging systems  the impact of lower than average margins related to the ongc sale and the sale of a low margin pre funded multi client survey by ion solutions 
this decrease was partially offset by stronger margins from our marine imaging systems due to increased sales of our source and seabed product lines 
we also had an increase in higher margin sales from our data management solutions segment due to product mix  including significantly increased sales of our orca software 
research and development 
research and development expense was million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses in at or above these levels on an absolute dollar basis  as we continue to invest heavily in our next generation of seismic acquisition products and services  including products 
table of contents such as firefly and digistreamer 
for a discussion of our product research and development programs in  see item business product research and development 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  increased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the reduction in marketing and sales expense as a percentage of net revenues reflects our focus on leveraging our marketing and sales costs with our sales growth 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenditures reflects the hiring of additional sales personnel as well as increased travel associated with our global marketing efforts 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our sales commissions  which reflects more effective utilization of our internal sales force 
we intend to continue investing significant sums in our marketing efforts as we seek to penetrate markets with our new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures was primarily due to higher payroll costs associated with an increase in management and corporate personnel and an increase in travel associated with our global solutions corporate strategy 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in professional accounting and consulting fees compared to loss on debt conversion 
in november  million of our million convertible senior notes indebtedness was converted into approximately million shares of our common stock  in accordance with the terms of the notes 
the conversion arrangement included a one time charge of million that represented the present value of future interest payments through the converted notes original date of maturity of december  income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in tax expense during primarily relates to improved results of our foreign operations  us alternative minimum taxes and deferred taxes on the utilization of acquired net operating losses 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the similar period during the increased effective tax rate for relates to improved results of operations of our foreign divisions and deferred tax expense related to the utilization of acquired net operating losses of million 
the and effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of previously reserved us deferred tax assets 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
preferred stock dividends and accretion of million for the year ended december  relate to our series d preferred stock that we issued in and the series d preferred stock that we issued in december dividends are paid at a rate equal to the greater of i five percent per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus two and one half percent per annum 
all dividends paid on the series d and series d preferred stock have been paid in cash 
the preferred stock dividend rate was at december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  increased million  compared to s revenues  principally due to increased activity and demand for seismic services 
land imaging systems net revenues increased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to an increase in sales of our land acquisition systems  vibrator trucks  and our sensor geophones 
marine imaging systems net revenues increased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december  due to the significant upturn in demand for towed marine seismic equipment as well as deliveries of our vectorseis ocean systems to rxt 
ion solutions seismic imaging solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in this increase was related to higher proprietary processing revenues and 
table of contents pre funded multi client seismic surveys primarily off the coasts of india  northern canada and alaska  partially offset by a decrease in off the shelf seismic data sales 
data management solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in  reflecting the increased demand for marine seismic work 
gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to s gross profit 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in our gross margin percentages is primarily due to an increase in revenues from pre funded multi client seismic surveys with higher margins  offset by continued pricing pressures on our land acquisition system sales and sensor geophone sales as well as a higher mix of lower margin vibrator truck sales during compared to research and development 
research and development expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to  due to our continuing investment in our next generation of seismic acquisition products and services  including products such as firefly and digifin 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of an increase in commissions to employees and our non employee sales force associated with our overall increase in sales during  in addition to the impact of our adopting sfas r

preferred stock dividends and accretion 
preferred stock dividends and accretion of million for the year ended december  related to our outstanding series d preferred stock that we issued in the preferred stock dividend rate was at december  liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements include working capital requirements  debt service payments  dividend payments on our preferred stock  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we expect our future liquidity needs to be provided by a combination of cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  our revolving credit facility and other sources 
we also utilize a sale leaseback arrangement for our stafford  texas facility  capital leases for many of our capital equipment expenditures and non cancelable operating leases for certain offices  processing centers and fabrication space 
in order to fund future acquisitions and undertake large capital projects  we may obtain funds from our existing facilities  issue additional debt to the extent permitted under our existing financing arrangements or we may issue additional equity securities 
sources of capital revolving line of credit 
in march  we obtained a million revolving line of credit the facility with a maturity date of march the facility replaced our million revolving line of credit facility that was scheduled to mature in may there was no outstanding balance under the facility at december  the facility is available for revolving credit borrowings to be used for our working 
table of contents capital needs and general corporate purposes  subject to a borrowing base 
in addition  the facility includes a million sub limit for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at december  the facility includes an accordion feature under which the total commitments under the facility may be increased to million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the facility borrowing base is calculated based on the sum of i of our total eligible accounts receivable  eligible foreign accounts receivable and insured foreign accounts receivable  plus ii the lesser of x thirty percent of eligible inventory or y million 
for purposes of this calculation  eligible foreign accounts receivable cannot exceed million 
as of december   the borrowing base calculation permitted total borrowings of million  of which million remained available 
the interest rate on borrowings under the facility will be  at our option  i an alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement or ii for eurodollar borrowings  a libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the amount of the margin will be based on our then current leverage ratio as defined in the facility credit agreement 
the applicable margin will be increased by with respect to any borrowings that are applied to repay the convertible senior notes debt 
we are obligated to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the facility 
a significant portion of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the facility credit agreement restricts our ability to pay common stock dividends  incur additional debt  sell significant assets  acquire other businesses  merge with other entities and take certain other actions without the consent of the lenders 
the credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants 
these covenants include requirements to i maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to  and ii not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of to upon retirement of our convertible senior notes debt  the maximum leverage ratio will be reduced to to for months  and then to to thereafter 
the february  amendment to the facility modified the indebtedness covenant to permit certain intercompany indebtedness of up to million during  and million thereafter owing to ourselves and our domestic subsidiaries by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and provided for certain additional financial covenants with respect to our domestic operations and subsidiaries 
specifically  these additional financial covenants obligate us to x not exceed a minimum domestic fixed charge coverage ratio of to  y not exceed a maximum domestic leverage ratio of to  and z not permit the ratio of the book value of total receivables  cash  permitted investments  inventory and equipment of ourselves and our domestic subsidiaries  to the total commitments of the lenders under the facility  to be less than to in addition  the facility contains certain curative provisions with respect to any technical defaults that may have resulted under the facility related to the intercompany indebtedness permitted above or our internal international restructuring 
as of february   we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the facility 
convertible preferred stock 
in february  we issued  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock in a privately negotiated transaction  and received million in net proceeds 
the conversion price per share for common stock under the series d preferred stock is per share subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
under our agreement with the series d preferred stock purchaser  we also granted to the purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of series d preferred stock  having a conversion price equal to of an average daily volume weighted market price of our common stock over a trailing period of days  as of the time of issuance 
in december  the holder exercised this option and purchased  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock for million 
in addition  on february   the holder exercised the option and purchased the remaining  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock for million 
the shares of series d and series d preferred stock have substantially identical terms to the series d preferred stock  except that the series d 
table of contents preferred stock has a conversion price per share of  and the series d preferred stock has a conversion price per share of 
the conversion prices in each instance were based on the times average daily volume weighted market price formula contained in our agreement with the holder 
on february   the day before the closing of the sale of the series d preferred stock  the closing market price per share of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange was 
the net proceeds from the sale of these shares of series d and series d preferred stock will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
all rights held by the holder to purchase shares of our preferred stock have been exercised 
the holder of the preferred stock has the right to redeem  at any time  all or part of its series d preferred stock 
we may satisfy our redemption obligations either in cash or by the issuance of our common stock  adjusted based upon changes in our day average prevailing market price of our common stock at the time of redemption  but the conversion price cannot be less than a minimum price of per share  subject to adjustment 
if the day average price of our common stock is less than this minimum price during that time  we may satisfy our redemption obligation by resetting the conversion price to this minimum price  and thereafter  all dividends must be paid in cash 
in the event we cannot deliver registered shares upon redemption for stock  and to the extent we cannot deliver cash  the dividend rate will increase to 
under the agreement  the series d preferred stock has a minimum annual dividend rate of and a maximum annual dividend rate of libor plus 
so long as any shares of series d preferred stock are outstanding  the company may not pay any dividends in cash or property to holders of the company s common stock  and may not purchase or redeem for cash or property any common stock  unless there are no arrearages in dividends paid on the series d preferred stock and sufficient cash has been set aside to pay dividends on the series d preferred stock for the next four quarterly dividend periods 
dividends are payable quarterly in cash or common shares at the company s option 
to date  all dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock have been paid in cash  and we intend for the foreseeable future to continue to pay cash dividends on those shares 
convertible notes 
as of december   million of our original million principal amount of our convertible senior notes were outstanding 
these notes mature on december  the notes are not redeemable prior to their maturity  and are convertible into the company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes a conversion price of per share 
in november  a holder of million of our convertible senior notes approached us and made an offer to convert its notes into common stock 
the conversion occurred on november   and we issued to the holder  shares upon conversion  in accordance with the terms of the notes 
we also paid a one time charge of million  which represented the net present value of the remaining interest payments until the note s maturity in december the accrued interest of million earned through the date of conversion was also paid to the holder under our agreement with the holder 
the remaining million balance of our convertible senior notes outstanding can currently be converted into  shares of our common stock 
the conversion prices per share of common stock under the series d preferred stock and the convertible senior notes are substantially below the currently prevailing market prices for our common stock 
converting all of the series d preferred stock and the remaining convertible senior notes at one time would result in significant dilution to our stockholders that could limit our ability to raise additional capital 
cash flow from operations we have historically financed our operations from internally generated cash and funds from equity and debt financings 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided in our operating activities was primarily

cash flow from investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the principal uses of our cash for investing activities during the year ended december  were million of equipment purchases and a million investment in our multi client data library 
we expect to spend approximately million on investments in our multi client data library during  and anticipate that a majority of this investment will be underwritten by our customers 
the level of our investment in our multi client data could fluctuate significantly based upon the level of customer underwriting obtained 
in addition  capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million with approximately million related to ion solutions computer equipment purchases  which are generally financed through capital leases 
the remaining sums are anticipated to be funded from internally generated cash 
cash flow from financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million of cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  we paid an aggregate of million of cash dividends on our series d preferred stock and on our series d preferred stock during we made scheduled payments of million on our notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations 
our employees exercised stock options and purchased common stock  resulting in proceeds to us of million during the period  and we received million in december related to the sale of  shares of our series d preferred stock 
inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has not had a material effect on our costs of goods or labor  or the prices for our products or services 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year

the operating lease commitments at december  relate to our leases for certain equipment  offices  processing centers  and warehouse space under non cancelable operating leases 

table of contents the liability for product warranties at december  relate to the estimated future warranty expenditures associated with our products 
our warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we record an accrual for product warranties and other contingencies at the time of sale  which is when the estimated future expenditures associated with those contingencies become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
we generally receive warranty support from our suppliers regarding equipment they manufactured 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to our committed inventory purchase orders for which deliveries are scheduled to be made in in  we entered into a five year exclusive supply agreement with colibrys ltd 
for the purchase of mems accelerometers  which include annual minimum commitments ranging between million to million per year through in february  we issued  shares of series d preferred stock receiving million in net proceeds 
in december  the holders of the series d preferred stock purchased an additional  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock resulting in million in net proceeds 
these shares of preferred stock are currently redeemable at the option of the holder 
however  because we may satisfy our redemption obligations either in cash or by issuance of our common stock  we have excluded the series d and series d preferred stock from the above table 
dividends  which are paid quarterly  may be paid  at our option  either in cash or by the issuance of our common stock 
the dividend rate was at december  to date  we have paid only cash dividends and expect that we will continue to pay only cash dividends for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition and product warranty we derive revenue from the sale of i acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our land imaging systems and marine imaging systems segments  ii imaging services  multi client surveys and licenses of off the shelf data libraries within our ion solutions segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our data management solutions segment 
for the sales of acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition and recognize revenue when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the acquisition system or other seismic equipment is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
revenues from multi client surveys are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based 
table of contents upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the survey data is considered off the shelf and licenses to the survey data are sold to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the license of a completed multi client survey is represented by the license of one standard set of data 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of emerging issues task force eitf accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement  and allocate revenue to each element based upon its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  so long as each such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services 
we generally do not grant return or refund privileges to our customers 
when undelivered elements  such as training courses and engineering services  are inconsequential or perfunctory and not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we recognize revenue on the total contract and make a provision for the costs of the incomplete elements 
for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements of sop software revenue recognition  because in those systems the software is more than incidental to the arrangement as a whole 
following the requirements of eitf applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  we consider the hardware within these systems to be a software related item because the software is essential to the hardware s functionality 
as a result  we recognize revenue from sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software and software related hardware is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element or  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
even though a majority of our software arrangements are licensed on a perpetual basis  we do offer certain time based software licenses 
for these time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to three years 
we generally warrant that our manufactured equipment will be free from defects in workmanship  material and parts 
warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we provide for estimated warranty as a charge to costs of sales at the time of sale 
multi client data library our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related expenses  
table of contents and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library  million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of a multi client data library available for commercial sale is the greater of i the percentage of actual revenue to the total estimated revenue multiplied by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating amortization 
the total amortization period of four years represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we have determined the amortization period of four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during four years subsequent to survey completion 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 
we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no significant impairment charges during  and reserve for excess and obsolete inventories our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory and the timing of market acceptance of our new products 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for reasons such as delayed market acceptance of our new products  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill 
in making this assessment we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  we established the following reporting units land imaging systems  sensor geophone  marine imaging systems  data management solutions  and ion solutions formerly referred to as seismic imaging solutions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns 
table of contents valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  the impairment test results could differ 
sfas requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting units is less than its carrying value 
our intangible assets other than goodwill relate to computer software  proprietary technology  patents  customer relationships and trade names that are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
accounts and notes receivable collectibility we consider current information and circumstances regarding our customers ability to repay their obligations  such as the length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  the customers credit worthiness and historical experience  and consider an account or note impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due 
when we consider an account or note as impaired  we measure the amount of the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of collateral 
we include impairment losses recoveries in our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes through an increase decrease in bad debt expense 
we record interest income on investments in notes receivable on the accrual basis of accounting 
we do not accrue interest on impaired loans where collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors we consider in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the fair value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower  and iv anticipated future events 
stock based compensation prior to january   our equity compensation plans were accounted for under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
we did not recognize stock based compensation expense associated with our stock options in our statement of operations for periods prior to january  because all of our stock options granted had an exercise price equal to or in excess of the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost recognized in the years ended december  and includes a compensation cost for all unvested stock based awards as of january  that had been granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
with our adoption of sfas r  we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the values of our stock based awards were estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under sfas the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
our estimates of expected volatility for our stock price used in calculating fair value of our stock based compensation under sfas r for the twelve months ended december  and 
table of contents were based on assumptions involving a combination of historical volatility and market based implied volatility derived from traded options on our common stock 
prior to  our calculation of expected volatility was based solely on historical volatility 
see note stockholders equity and stock based compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we currently recognize stock based compensation expense on the straight line basis over the service period of each award generally the vesting period of the award 
we had recognized compensation expense in our pro forma disclosures under sfas on the straight line basis for our stock options 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized compensation expense related to our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards using the accelerated method of amortization and will continue to apply the accelerated method to all outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units awards granted prior to january  also  prior to our adoption to sfas r  we accounted for forfeitures of our restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants as the forfeitures actually occurred 
we estimated forfeitures on our unvested restricted stock outstanding as of january   and recorded a million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to reflect the compensation cost that would not have been recognized in prior periods had forfeitures been estimated during these periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning january  we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  we are continuing to assess the potential effects of sfas no 
as additional guidance becomes available 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows companies the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  establishes presentation and disclosure requirements and requires additional disclosure surrounding the valuation of the financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
 which occurred on january   to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  we are continuing to assess the potential effects of sfas no 
as additional guidance becomes available 
effective july    we adopted the eitf topic d  determining the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share under fasb statement no 
topic d 
topic d conveys the sec staff s views on determining whether the characteristics of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more like debt or equity 
the sec staff believes that in evaluating an embedded derivative feature for separation under sfas  the consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract should not ignore the stated or implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument 
the adoption of topic d did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
credit and sales risks no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively of our consolidated net revenues 
the loss of any significant customers or a deterioration in our relationship with either customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for the twelve months ended december   we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in africa  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  and million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended 
table of contents december  and  international sales comprised and  respectively  of total net revenues 
in recent years  the cis and certain latin american countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world or the collectibility of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in these higher risk countries to provide their own financing and in some cases assist the customer in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be inappropriate for credit risk purposes 
certain relationships and related party transactions james m 
lapeyre  jr 
is chairman of our board of directors 
he is also the chairman and a significant equity owner of laitram  llc laitram and has served as president of laitram and its predecessors since laitram is a privately owned  new orleans based manufacturer of food processing equipment and modular conveyor belts 
mr 
lapeyre and laitram together own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we acquired digicourse  inc  our marine positioning products business  from laitram in and have renamed it i o marine systems  inc in connection with that acquisition  we entered into a continued services agreement with laitram under which laitram agreed to provide us certain accounting  software  manufacturing  and maintenance services 
manufacturing services consist primarily of machining of parts for our marine positioning systems 
the term of this agreement expired in september but we continue to operate under its terms 
in addition  when we have requested  the legal staff of laitram has advised us on certain intellectual property matters with regard to our marine positioning systems 
under a lease of commercial property dated february   between lapeyre properties llc an affiliate of laitram and ion  we agreed to lease certain office and warehouse space from lapeyre properties until january during  we paid laitram a total of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million for manufacturing services  million for rent and other pass through third party facilities charges  and million for other services 
for the and fiscal years  we paid laitram a total of approximately million and million for these services 
in the opinion of our management  the terms of these services are fair and reasonable and as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties at the time of their performance 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as a result  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations 
historically  payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates and to foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk in february  we issued  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock 
in addition  in december  the holder exercised its right to purchase an additional 
table of contents  shares series d preferred stock 
dividends  which are contractually obligated to be paid quarterly  may be paid  at our option  either in cash or by the issuance of our common stock 
dividends are paid at a variable rate  equal to the greater of i five percent per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus two and one half percent per annum 
the dividend rate for the series d preferred stock and for the series d preferred stock was at december  each basis point increase in the libor rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of dividends to be paid by approximately million 
with respect to our fixed rate long term debt outstanding  the fair market value of our outstanding notes payable and long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the large decrease in this amount is due to approximately of our convertible debt being converted to common shares during foreign currency exchange rate risk through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the netherlands  united kingdom  china  venezuela  canada  india  russia  the united arab emirates  and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the netherlands and united kingdom 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in euros and british pounds gbp  respectively 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in euros or gbp  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars
