item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a biotechnology company committed to the discovery and development of improved next generation protein pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease and serious medical conditions 
we began operations in march with the mission to develop important commercial products through the use of biotechnology 
since then  we have established a focus in human therapeutics  particularly on the development of optimized protein pharmaceuticals 
three of our next generation product candidates are currently in clinical or preclinical development maxy g  a pegylated  granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf product for the treatment of neutropenia  maxy vii  a factor viia product for the treatment of hemophilia and possibly acute bleeding conditions  and maxy  a ctla ig product for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other immune or autoimmune diseases 
in addition to our clinical and preclinical stage product candidates  we have other research stage programs and assets outside of our core business  including research on certain vaccine programs 
we use our technology platform  molecularbreeding directed evolution  along with pegylation  glycosylation  rational design and mutagenesis  in an effort to create improved  proprietary proteins 
our molecularbreeding technology platform  also referred to as dna shuffling  can be used to create new versions of any known protein 
we believe that once a desired improvement has been identified  the chance of being able to create a novel protein with that desired improvement is high 

table of contents to date  we have generated revenues from collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical and agriculture companies and from government grants 
however  over the past several years  we have strategically shifted our focus to pharmaceutical products and believe this is an important step in building long term value in our company 
revenues from our collaboration agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we also recorded million in revenue from related party under our license agreement with codexis 
these revenues reflect amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell oil products us that began in november and million recognized in the fourth quarter of in connection with an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
we expect our total revenues to decrease in compared to  primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under our co development agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which roche terminated in april we also expect much lower revenue in under our license agreement with codexis since a significant portion of the revenue we recorded under this agreement in related to a one time upfront payment that codexis received from shell 
due to the nature of our research  our revenue may fluctuate substantially from year to year  based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
as a result  due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into new collaboration arrangements or receive any future milestone payments or royalty payments under such collaborations or whether any independent research effort or future collaboration will ultimately result in a commercial product 
we have incurred significant operating losses from continuing operations since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
our research and development expenses for were million  compared to million in and million in including million of research and development expenses attributable to codexis  our former chemicals segment  in 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years and may never achieve profitability 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position to fund our expanded product development efforts  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  major developments in in july  we commenced a phase iia clinical trial of maxy g in breast cancer patients in eastern europe 
we announced positive progress in this clinical trial in january  including that maxy g showed clinical activity at the lowest dose level of g kg and that no immunogenicity or serious adverse events were observed 
in may  we announced our plans to proceed with the clinical development of our lead maxy vii product candidate for hemophilia 
we currently plan to file our first clinical trial application cta in the first half of and commence a first in human clinical trial in hemophilia patients in the second half of in november  we announced the preclinical development of our most recent product candidate  maxy  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
we plan to conduct in vivo proof of concept preclinical studies with our maxy product candidates and select one or more lead product candidates in during  we recognized approximately million in revenue under our license agreement with codexis  including million recognized in the fourth quarter of in connection with an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
in december  we licensed our proprietary dengue virus antigen technology to sanofi pasteur  the vaccines division of the sanofi aventis group for development and worldwide commercialization of a second generation vaccine 
we received an upfront fee and are eligible to receive up to an additional million of event based payments under the agreement  as well as royalties on any product sales 
in april  roche terminated the collaboration agreement for our maxy vii product candidates due to the inability of the parties to de risk the program in preclinical testing by failing to establish an animal model suitable to 
table of contents demonstrate cessation of acute bleeding in a trauma setting 
we entered into this agreement with roche in december revenues under this agreement constituted a substantial portion of our total revenues in and and we expected this agreement to provide a substantial portion of our revenue for the next several years 
in addition to an upfront fee  revenues earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities under the agreement and a million milestone payment received in  we were also eligible to receive additional milestone payments under this agreement of up to million upon the achievement of development and other milestones  as well as royalties on any product sales 
in november  we agreed with roche to terminate the collaboration agreement for our maxy alpha product candidates due to preliminary observations of an unexpected reduction of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of maxy alpha during a phase ia clinical trial 
we entered into this agreement with roche in may we received an initial payment and full research and development funding for the first two years of this agreement 
in addition  we received million of milestone payments from roche during the term of the agreement and we were eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to million  as well as royalties on any product sales 
also in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california in an effort to reduce costs and increase overall operational efficiency across our research  preclinical  clinical and regulatory activities 
the consolidation has resulted in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  our wholly owned subsidiary in denmark 
as a result of the consolidation  we have recorded charges of approximately million relating primarily to one time termination benefits for the affected employees of maxygen aps and related expenses and we expect to incur additional costs of approximately million relating to the consolidation and expect to complete the activities related to this consolidation during the second quarter of background we began operations in to commercialize technologies originally conceived at affymax research institute  then a subsidiary of what is now glaxosmithkline plc 
our operations were originally focused on the application of our molecularbreeding directed evolution platform and other technologies to the development of multiple products in a broad range of industries  including human therapeutics  chemicals and agriculture 
in august  to complement and expand our human therapeutics operations  we established our danish subsidiary  maxygen aps  through the acquisition of profound pharma a s  a privately held danish biotechnology company 
in  prior to our focus on human therapeutics  we established two industrial subsidiaries  codexis  inc  or codexis  and verdia  inc  or verdia 
we established codexis to focus on the development of biocatalysis and fermentation processes and advanced small molecule pharmaceutical intermediaries for the pharmaceutical industry 
codexis received financing from third party investors and operated as an independent subsidiary beginning in september in february  our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date and instead account for codexis under the equity method of accounting 
to reflect what our basis in codexis would have been under equity accounting  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million in the first quarter of  which reduced our net loss in and brought our investment basis in codexis to zero as of february  at december   we had an equity interest in codexis of approximately of its outstanding capital stock 
we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of codexis 
we established verdia to focus on the development of processes and products for the agricultural industry 
on july   we completed the sale of verdia to pioneer hi bred international  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ei du pont de nemours and company  for cash proceeds of million 
in july  we established avidia inc formerly avidia research institute  or avidia  together with third party investors 
avidia was formed as a spin out of maxygen to focus on the development of a new class of subunit proteins as therapeutic products 
we also received equity interests in avidia through our initial contribution of technology and funding and our participation in subsequent preferred stock financings of avidia 
on october   amgen inc completed the acquisition of avidia and avidia became a wholly owned subsidiary of amgen inc 
table of contents at the time of the acquisition of avidia by amgen inc  our basis in avidia was zero 
as a result of the acquisition  we received cash proceeds of approximately million before  of income taxes in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia and may receive up to an additional million in cash  contingent upon the development of certain avidia products by amgen inc this contingent amount was reduced from million based on the discontinuation by amgen inc of certain development activities 
under an agreement that we entered into with avidia at the time of avidia s formation  we have retained certain exclusive and non exclusive rights to use avidia technology to develop and commercialize products directed to certain specific targets 
as discussed above  we implemented a plan in november to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california resulting in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands  as well as the results of codexis through february  critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis at least annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
we review our intangible assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include existing product portfolio  product development cycle  development expenses  potential royalties and product sales  costs of goods and selling expenses and overall product lifecycle 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external events  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our corporate collaboration agreements have generally provided for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  a collaborator may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
such payments are recognized ratably over the related research and development period 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including license fees  and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the upfront payments are recognized on a straight line basis over the period 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  we recognize the upfront payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of our total expected effort 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires us to make critical estimates in both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of our obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
collaborative agreements also may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue from license agreements for which no further performance obligations exist is recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or when the amount can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license payments and research funding under existing and possible future government research grants and may include research funding and milestone payments under possible future collaborative arrangements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting for clinical trial costs we charge research and development costs  including clinical study costs  to expense when incurred  consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
most of our clinical studies are performed by a third party contract research organization cro 
the clinical trials generally have three distinctive stages plus pass through costs start up initial setting up of the trial  enrollment of patients in the trial  and close down and reporting of the trial 
we review the list of expenses for the trial from the original signed agreements and separate them into what we perceive as start up  enrollment or closedown expenses of the clinical trial 
the start up costs  which usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and include costs  such as study initiation  site recruitment  regulatory applications and investigator meetings  are expensed ratably over the start up period 
the site management  study management  medical and safety monitoring and data management expenses are calculated on a per patient basis and expensed ratably over the treatment period beginning on the date that the patient enrolls 
the close down and reporting expenses are expensed ratably over the close out period of time 
pass through costs  including the costs of the drugs  are expensed as incurred 
in general  our service agreements permit us to terminate at will where we would continue to be responsible for payment of all services completed or pro rata completed at the time of notice of termination  plus any non cancellable expenses that have been entered into by the cro on our behalf 
restructuring charge in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california 
the consolidation has resulted in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  our wholly owned subsidiary in denmark 
in connection with the consolidation  we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  costs associated with restructuring activities generally have been recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property is vacated or at the point when we cease to use the leased equipment 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including estimating the salvage value of equipment consistent with abandonment date 
in addition  post employment benefits accrued for workforce reductions related to restructuring activities are accounted for under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas 
a liability for post employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  the obligation is attributable to employees services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under this restructuring 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
in connection with the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  we have determined that the remaining useful lives of certain of the fixed assets at maxygen aps have been shortened to three months for equipment and to six months for leasehold improvements at november  the remaining book value of these assets is depreciated over the shorter estimated remaining useful lives and the depreciation expense is reflected in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation expense beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility and future stock price trends based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  amortized on a graded vesting basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
under this method of implementation  no restatement of prior periods has been made 
prior to our implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas since the exercise price of all options granted was not below the fair market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date  prior to our implementation of sfas r we generally recognized no equity based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation for a further discussion 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  was million related to employee stock options   related to consultant stock options   related to the espp and  included in the restructuring charge  and for the year ended december  was million related to employee stock options   related to consultant stock options and  related to the espp 
as a result of the application of sfas r  our net loss for the years ended december  and increased by million and million  respectively 
sfas r also increased basic and fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations by and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sfas r did not have an impact on cash flows from operations during the years ended december  and in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in   in and  in stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants included in research and development expense was  in   in and  in stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants included in general and administrative expense was none in   in and  in in connection with the cessation of our operations in denmark and the consolidation of our operations in the united states  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in as part of the restructuring charge 
this expense results from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues have been derived primarily from collaboration and license agreements and government research grants 
total revenues were million in  million in and million in the decrease in revenue from to and the increase in revenue from to resulted primarily from changes in revenues recognized under our prior collaboration agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  as discussed below 
revenues from our collaboration agreements were million in  million in and million in roche was the only collaborative partner that contributed significantly to our collaborative research and development revenues during  and the initial funded research term of our collaboration with roche for our maxy alpha product candidates ended in december and the collaboration agreement was terminated in november in december  we entered into a new collaboration with roche for co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates for acute bleeding indications 
in april  roche terminated this agreement due to the inability of the parties to de risk the program in preclinical testing by failing to establish an animal model suitable to demonstrate cessation of acute bleeding in a trauma setting 
the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under the co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates 
for  our collaborative research and development revenue included million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities prior to the termination of this agreement 
the termination of this agreement also caused us to accelerate the recognition of million of deferred revenue in the first half of relating to the million non refundable upfront license fee received from roche in revenue in also includes a million non refundable license fee received from sanofi pasteur 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to including million of revenues attributable to the consolidation of codexis through february  was primarily due to collaborative research and development revenue from the collaboration with roche for our maxy vii product candidates 
our revenues for relating to this collaboration consisted primarily of a million milestone payment  million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities and million related to the amortization of the non refundable upfront license fee we received from roche in december our revenues for also include a million milestone payment we received from roche as a result of the initiation by roche of clinical trials of our maxy alpha product candidate 
in  we recognized million in revenue from related party under our license agreement with codexis 
these revenues reflect amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell oil products us that began in november and million recognized in the fourth quarter of in connection with an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
revenues from government research grants were million in  million in and million in the increase in grant revenue of million from to and million from to primarily reflects an increase in activity due to the beginning of three new government grant projects in the third quarter of in  revenues from government research grants also include million from a contract with the us department of defense for hiv vaccine discovery that expired in october we expect our revenues for to decrease compared to  due primarily to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under the co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates 
we also expect much lower revenue in under our license agreement with codexis since a significant portion of the revenue recorded under this agreement in related to the one time upfront payment that codexis received from shell 
our revenue may fluctuate substantially from year to year based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and our receipt of development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we 
table of contents will enter into any new licensing or collaborative agreements or receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing  collaboration or other agreements or whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product 
prior to our deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   we operated as two segments  human therapeutics and chemicals 
revenues for each operating segment were derived from our collaboration agreements and government research grants and were categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
results of codexis through february  are shown as our chemicals segment 
after february   we have operated as one segment  human therapeutics 
the following table presents revenues for each operating segment in thousands year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals through february  total revenue the changes in revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to and from to are discussed above 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of research consultants and external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility costs  supplies and depreciation 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in including million of research and development expenses attributable to codexis in 
the increases in our research and development expenses of million from to and million from to excluding million of research and development expenses attributable to codexis in were primarily related to increased external expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates  the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials and increased salaries and benefits 
for  our implementation of sfas r also increased our research and development expenses compared to stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the issuance of stock options to new us employees that we hired to expand our clinical regulatory organization and to replace capabilities previously performed in denmark 
stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from  in to million in  primarily as a result of our implementation of sfas r 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by collaborators and government grants  on the one hand  and projects funded by us  on the other hand 
to approximate research and development expenses by funding category  the number of hours expended in each category has been multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort and added to project specific external costs 
in the case where a collaborative partner is sharing the research and development costs  the expenses for that project are allocated proportionately between the collaborative projects funded by third parties and internal projects 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 

table of contents the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  collaborative projects funded by third parties government grants internal projects total research and development expenses related to collaborative projects funded by third parties may be less than the reported revenues due to the amortization of non refundable upfront payments  as well as a portion of the collaborative research and development revenue that is charged for general and administrative expenses 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality and may be barred from commercialization if they are found to infringe or otherwise violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
we expect that our research and development costs will decrease in over  due to savings realized in connection with the cessation of our operations in denmark and the consolidation of our operations in the united states 
any decrease in our research and development costs will be partially offset by an increase in research and development costs resulting from advancement of our product candidates through clinical and preclinical development  including the continued clinical development of our maxy g product candidate and the planned clinical development of our maxy vii product candidates 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase over the next several years if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into and through clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our product candidates prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our product candidates against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 
in addition  the application of sfas r had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share for the years ended december  and and is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share in the future 
the continued impact of sfas r will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  as well as stock compensation  insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative stock compensation expense was million in  million in and  in 
table of contents the decrease of million in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to million lower stock compensation expense resulting from consultant options granted in april which were fully amortized by april and an increased number of unvested options being cancelled in compared to the decrease also reflects lower expenditures on external consultants and market analysis 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to the increase in stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses resulting from our implementation of sfas r and higher stock compensation expense resulting from consultant options 
this increase was offset in part by reduced personnel costs resulting from terminations and the deconsolidation of codexis in our general and administrative expenses during should be consistent with general and administrative expenses for  depending on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in  the use of external consultants and market analysis  and expenditures for legal and accounting services 
restructuring charge in  we recognized a charge of million resulting from the cessation of operations at maxygen aps  our danish subsidiary  and the consolidation of our operations in the united states 
this charge primarily includes post employment and one time termination benefits for the affected employees of maxygen aps and other costs associated with exit activities 
this charge also includes stock compensation expense of approximately  this expense results from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees 
we expect to recognize additional costs of approximately million in the first half of relating to facilities closure and lease termination expenses 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
interest income and other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and currency transaction gains or losses related to the funding of our danish subsidiary  maxygen aps 
interest income and other income expense  net was million in  million in and million in included in these amounts are foreign exchange losses of million in   in and  in the decrease from to reflects higher foreign exchange losses in partially offset by higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates on a lower investment base 
the increases in interest income and other income expense  net from to reflect higher interest income reflecting higher interest rates on lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  plus a decrease in foreign exchange losses 
equity in losses of minority investee equity in losses of minority investee reflects our share of the net loss of codexis 
in may  we purchased  of secured subordinated convertible promissory notes and  in august  the notes and accrued interest were converted into codexis preferred stock and we purchased approximately  of additional preferred stock 
subsequent to our investments in may and august  we recorded losses of million under the equity method of accounting and as of december   we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in codexis

cumulative effect adjustment codexis was formed in january and financed by us and several other investors in september and october of until february   we recognized of the operating results of codexis  even though we only owned a majority of the voting interests in codexis 
at such time  we had recorded cumulative losses of codexis in the amount of million  which was in excess of our investment basis of million

we also received an upfront fee and may earn royalties on future product sales  if any 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding expected to be received from licensors and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all investments and substantially all cash and cash equivalents are held in us currency  with approximately of cash and cash equivalents held in danish kroner at december  as of december   of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
due to the recent adverse developments in the credit markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which averages one year or less and may not exceed two years 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of commercial debt securities  with an average time to maturity of days 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and the maturities of short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we have the ability and intent to hold our debt securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at full par value 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations previously consisted of research and development activities performed in denmark by our wholly owned subsidiary  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of our danish operations was its local currency through november  however  in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california  resulting in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps 
as a result  we have reevaluated the functional currency for our danish operations and determined that it is the us dollar after november  in  excluding stock compensation expenses  approximately of our operating expenses related to maxygen aps 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the danish kroner and the euro 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner or the euro will result in an increase of our reported operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million 
at december   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts 
during  we recognized  in foreign exchange losses from hedge contracts and these losses were included with interest and other income  net
