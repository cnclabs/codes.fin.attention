item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview based upon net sales  we are one of the largest distributors of animal health products in the united states and canada 
we sell more than  products sourced from over  manufacturers to over  customers  as well as provide consultative services to our customers in the highly fragmented animal health products industry 
products we distribute include pharmaceuticals  vaccines  parasiticides  diagnostics  capital equipment  sanitizers  devices  supplies and dairy lagoon treatment systems 
our principal customers are veterinarians  production animal operators and animal health product retailers 
our growth has primarily been derived from internal growth initiatives supported by select strategic acquisitions 
key factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include overall growth in the dairy industry 
according to the usda over the last several years the demand for dairy products has increased 
as a result  the demand for production animal health products in the dairy market has increased 
we have capitalized on this demand with increased sales of our dairy related production animal health products 
we anticipate that this trend of growth in the dairy market will continue in the future and that we will be able to fulfill the corresponding demand for related production animal health products  resulting in increased sales and profitability 
consolidation by our customers in the dairy industry 
the dairy market is undergoing significant consolidation resulting in a shift towards larger operations 
according to the usda  dairies with or more cattle currently account for of the milk producing cow population in the united states  as compared to in over the last several years we have leveraged our relationships with larger dairies and our national footprint to gain market share in the dairy related production animal health products market 
we anticipate that this trend of dairy consolidation will continue and we will seek to continue to gain market share 
our ability to negotiate favorable terms from our manufacturers 
based upon net sales  we are one of the largest distributors in the production animal health products market 
we believe that due to our market position and local market share  we have been able to negotiate  in many instances  better prices and more favorable terms  including rebates and sales and placement incentives  from our manufacturers than our competitors 
increased focus on companion animal customers 
according to sundale research  over the last several years the market for companion animal health products has increased to approximately billion 
we believe this growth has been and will continue to be driven by the following trends widespread ownership of companion animals  increased importance of companion animals in households  growing awareness of companion animal health and wellness  technology migration from the human life science product sector into the practice of veterinary medicine  increased marketing programs sponsored by large pharmaceutical and companion animal nutrition companies  and prolonged companion animal life spans creating demand for geriatric companion animal care products 
over the past three years we have begun to penetrate the urban and suburban veterinarian markets 
we believe that by leveraging our centralized procurement and inventory management model we are well positioned to develop a leading cost to serve position in the companion animal health products market and to continue to capture market share  resulting in increased sales and profitability 
while we believe we are a leader in the companion animal health product market  the market is highly fragmented with numerous national  regional and local distributors  and a few of our competitors with bigger market share have greater financial and other resources than we do 
changes in consumer preferences 
the demand for production animal health products is heavily dependent upon consumer demand for beef  dairy  poultry and swine 
the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends  demands and preferences 
for example  changes in consumer diets may negatively affect consumer demand for beef  dairy  poultry or swine  and therefore reduce the demand for our production animal health products 
during the previous downturns in these markets  we experienced declines in sales and profitability 
we generate revenue from our customers in three ways 
over of our revenue is generated through buy sell transactions 
the remainder comes from consignment and agency transactions 
in the buy sell transactions  we take title to inventory from our manufacturers 
we sell products to customers and invoice them 
buy sell transactions are advantageous to us over other sales methods because we take title to the inventory and are able to promote these products on behalf of manufacturers and effectively manage the pricing and distribution of these products 
for our consignment sales  we do not take title to the product  but we do stock and ship product to and invoice the customer 
for our agency sales  we transmit orders from our customers to our manufacturers 
the manufacturer ships the product directly to our customers and compensates us with a commission payment for handling the order from our customer and providing customer service 
manufacturers may occasionally switch between the buy sell and agency methods for particular products 
currently and for the past three fiscal years  only one product with material sales has required treatment as a consignment sale 
contracts with manufacturers are generally negotiated annually on a calendar year basis 
sales growth goals are negotiated and used to determine rebate achievement 
manufacturer rebates are classified in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of direct cost of products sold 
manufacturer rebates that are based on quarterly  trimester or annual goals have sales performance tracked continually versus the goal  and rebate income is adjusted accordingly when minimum hurdles are achieved 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the period from july  to june   on an actual basis and as a percentage of net sales 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and others  like us  report non direct costs in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and salaries  wages  commissions  and related benefits 
summary consolidated results of operations table year ended june  dollars in thousands net sales direct cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses includes salary  wages  commission  and related benefits acquisition costs depreciation and amortization operating income other income expense interest expense other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales direct cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses includes salary  wages  commission  and related benefits acquisition costs depreciation and amortization operating income other income expense interest expense other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to million  or  of sales from seven acquisitions completed during the second  third and fourth quarters of and the second quarter of  the addition of new customers  continued expansion into new territories  and increased sales to existing customers 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in gross profit resulted from sales growth  but was partially offset by a reduction in vendor rebates 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to a reduction in vendor rebates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase was the result of an increase in variable selling and distribution expenses driven by sales volume combined with million of increased sarbanes oxley section implementation costs  million of increased public company related expenses  million of increased stock option expenses  million of severance obligations accrued primarily for the company s former senior vice president and chief operating officer  and million of increased health care costs  all partially offset by the inclusion in the prior year of million of non recurring legal expenses related to the settlement of a dispute with a vendor 
the fixed nature of other corporate expenses helped to offset these increases  resulting in only a slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase results primarily from increased amortization of intangible assets driven by the acquisition of kane veterinary products  ltd 
in the second quarter of fiscal and adjustments to the purchase price allocations of the acquisitions completed during the second  third  and fourth quarters of other expenses 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in other expenses was due to a decrease in interest expense of million to million in the year ended june   as compared to million in the year ended june  this decrease was due to million of debt issue cost write offs and early extinguishment penalties incurred in the year ended june  as compared to million of debt issue cost write offs in the year ended june   combined with lower interest rates and decreased debt following the company s initial public offering 
income tax expenses 
income tax expense increased million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the effective tax rate was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the canadian tax rate in the year ended june   combined with an unfavorable blended state tax rate in the year ended june  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers  continued expansion into new territories  increased sales to existing customers  and the acquisitions of six companies during the year ended june  the number of field sales representatives increased to as of june   from as of june  the increase in field sales representatives allowed the company to expand into additional territories and attract new customers 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  the company s gross profit dollars increased as a result of sales growth but was slightly offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix to lower gross margin products and freight expense driven by an increase in fuel costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  an increase in variable selling and administrative expenses was due to increased sales volume combined with million of non recurring legal expenses related to the settlement of a dispute with a vendor and million of stock option expenses that represent the compensation expense recognized from the issuance of incentive stock options in january through june  even with these increases  the fixed nature of certain expenses drove a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales from for year ended june   to for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization remained relatively constant at million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  other expenses 
other expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in other expenses was due to an increase in interest expense of million to million in the year ended june   as compared to million in the year ended june  this increase was due to million of debt issue cost write offs and early extinguishment penalties resulting from the pay off of the second lien notes totaling million  and additional debt primarily resulting from the september debt refinancing and higher interest rates 
income tax expenses 
income tax expense increased million or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the effective tax rate was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to a combination of factors including a reduction of deferred tax liabilities driven by the lowering of a state tax in the prior year that reduced the prior year s tax rate  a change in our blended state tax rate in the year ended june   and permanent differences related to stock option and other expenses 
seasonality of operating results historically  our quarterly sales and operating results have varied significantly  and will likely continue to do so in the future 
seasonality has been caused by product usage  climate changes  promotions  rebates and announced price increases 
historically  sales have been higher during the spring and fall months due to increased sales of production animal health products 
the transportation of production animals during the spring and fall months drives seasonal product usage 
the transportation of production animals occurs during various times in the animal s life cycle 
the cycle begins with the cow calf stage where the calf is born and raised to six to eight months of age 
at that point the calf moves to pasture for three to five months 
the last movement occurs when the animal is placed in the feedyard 
movement and climate changes cause stress upon the animal  which increases the risk of disease 
thus  prior to each of these moves  the animal is typically treated for disease prevention 
these buying patterns can also be affected by manufacturers and distributors marketing programs launched during the summer months  particularly in june  which can cause customers to purchase production animal health products in advance of actual usage 
this kind of early purchasing may reduce the sales in the months these purchases would have typically been made 
in the companion animal health products market  sales of flea  tick and heartworm products drive sales during the spring and summer months 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors outside of management s control 
additionally  while we accrue rebates as they are earned  our rebates have historically been highest during the quarter ended december  since some of our manufacturers rebate programs are designed to include targets to be achieved on calendar year sales 
we anticipate that this trend with respect to manufacturers rebate programs will continue  but will not have as strong an impact upon the quarter ended december as it has in prior years due to manufactueres shifting growth goals from annual to quarterly or trimester goals 
for the reasons and factors discussed above  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and our sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our stock would likely decrease

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility established on june   and subsequently amended in september and october funds are expended to provide working capital that enables the company to maintain adequate inventory levels to promptly fulfill customer needs and expand operations 
the company expects its capital resources to be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months  and it expects cash flows from operations to be sufficient to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
operating activities

the debt issue cost amortization includes the write off of of debt issue costs resulting from the august refinancing of the term loan debt 
the change in working capital included a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million

borrowings remain collateralized by a first priority interest in and lien on all of the company s assets 
the company utilizes cash flow hedge accounting and uses derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
on april   the company entered into a million notional value swap transaction with a financial institution effective april  the company receives a floating rate based on libor and pays a fixed rate of 
the swap agreement terminates on june  as of june   the fair value of this swap was a net liability of million 
on april   the company entered into a million notional value swap transaction with a financial institution effective april  the company receives a floating rate based on libor and pays a fixed rate of 
the swap agreement terminates on may  as of june   the fair value of this swap was a net liability of million 
all swap agreement fair values are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as other assets when the fair value is a net asset or as other long term liabilities when the fair value is a net liability 
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on current settlement prices and quoted market prices of comparable contracts and represent their carrying values 
the company calculated no ineffectiveness on both interest rate swap agreements at june  an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes of million  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the market values of the interest rate swap agreements recorded in other comprehensive income loss may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if certain terms in the revolver or new term note change  if the revolver or new term note are extinguished  or if the interest rate swap agreements are terminated prior to maturity 
the net receipts or payments from the interest rate swap agreements are recorded in interest expense 
interest rates ranged from to as of june  and from to as of june  additionally  the company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused amount of the revolver at a per annum rate of 
the credit agreements contain certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain payments  sell assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and create liens 
moreover  certain of these agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
the most restrictive covenant relates to the creation or assumption of additional indebtedness 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants at june  off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table below 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of june  mature as follows payments due by period in thousands total year or less years years more than years line of credit to banks operating lease commitments long term debt obligations including current portion interest on long term debt and line of credit total contractual obligations future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
for debt instruments with variable interest rates  interest has been calculated for all future periods using the rates in effect as of june  there are some purchase obligations under purchase contracts  but management does not believe that they are material 
inflation most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on freight and fuel costs  employee wages and costs of products 
historically  we have been proactive in addressing inflation in attempts to limit its effects through the enactment of cost control initiatives 
critical accounting policies the sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  our management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are descriptions of our critical accounting policies that are impacted by such judgments  assumptions and estimates revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title passes according to shipping terms 
provision for sales returns is recorded at the time of sale for estimated products returned by customers 
provision for sales discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
revenues are presented net of sales taxes collected from retail customers and remitted to government taxing authorities 
manufacturer rebates 
inventory rebates are recognized when estimable and probable and include inventory purchase rebates and sales related rebates 
inventory purchase rebates received are capitalized into inventory while sales related rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
we expect that our future estimates will continue to be reasonable as our rebates are based upon specific vendor program goals and are recorded each month based principally upon achievement of sales performance measures 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
at june  and  the company performed its annual impairment test  and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the impairment test is performed by comparing the company s estimated fair value to the carrying amount of its goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the company will continue to evaluate goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets consisting of trademarks and trade names for potential impairment based upon any changes to the company s operations or its operating business environment 
amortizing intangible assets  including customer relationships and noncompete agreements  are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of twelve and eight years  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative purposes and therefore holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to variable interest rates on borrowings under the company s credit agreements 
during april  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements at an interest rate of on million of its debt in order to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
this interest rate swap effectively converted million of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
at june   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of million 
at june   million of the company s debt remained subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the company s remaining variable rate indebtedness rose basis points a change from the calculated weighted average interest rate as of june   assuming no change in the company s outstanding balance under its revolver and million first lien term loan  the company s annualized income before taxes and cash flows from operating activities would decline by approximately million 
if the weighted average interest rate on the company s remaining variable rate indebtedness decreased basis points a change from the calculated weighted average interest rate as of june   assuming no change in the company s outstanding balance under its revolver and million first lien term loan  the company s annualized income before taxes and cash flows from operating activities would increase by approximately million
