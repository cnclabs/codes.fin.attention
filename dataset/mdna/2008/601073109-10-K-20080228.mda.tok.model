item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of millipore corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
business overview we are a global leader in life science providing innovative products  services  and solutions so our customers can advance their research  development  and production 
our academic  biotechnology  and pharmaceutical customers use our consumable products and services to increase their speed and to improve their consistency while saving costs in laboratory applications and in biopharmaceutical manufacturing 
with our extensive technical expertise and applications knowledge  we have the unique ability to engage in peer to peer discussions with scientists to help them confront challenging scientific and human health issues 
we are organized around two operating divisions 
our bioscience division  which contributed approximately of our revenues  improves laboratory productivity and workflows by providing innovative products and technologies for life science research 
our bioprocess division  which contributed approximately of our revenues  helps pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies develop their manufacturing processes  to optimize their manufacturing productivity  and ensure the quality of drugs 
business drivers our bioscience market is primarily driven by the amount of research activity conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  governments and other organizations 
the more research that is conducted worldwide  the higher the demand is for our consumable products used in these research activities 
some of the key market trends affecting our bioscience division include the global expansion of laboratories  particularly in asia  the move from genomic based research toward protein research and cell biology  and higher demand for workflow based solutions that improve laboratory productivity 
for example  pressure on global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to identify new drug candidates has led to increasing demand for our products that increase laboratory productivity 
products that are pre validated and optimized with each other save time and increase efficiency for the researcher  particularly when combined in kits 
we have expanded our number of new products and incorporated our lab filtration  reagents and other products into critical laboratory protocols 
we believe customers are willing to pay a premium for innovation  expertise and streamlined purchase and service benefits 
the market drivers of our bioprocess division include increasing demand and production volumes of marketed therapeutics and the number of approvals for new biologics and new indications for existing biologics 
in particular  a higher number of approvals for monoclonal antibodies  recombinant vaccines and other recombinant protein based therapeutics are driving the market 
pharmaceutical companies are shifting more of their drug pipeline from chemically based drugs toward biologic drugs 
monoclonal antibodies are one of the fastest growing biologic drugs 
they are being produced in larger volumes because of increasing demand and their ability to treat diseases that previously had a limited number of therapies 
they are separation intensive  complex to produce  and require significant use of our products 
the growth in biologics is creating an increase in demand for our consumable products that enable the production of therapeutic drugs 
we provide a number of technologies that can be used in small scale production of a drug and be reliably scaled up to commercial size manufacturing volumes 
we are strategically positioned to gain customer access  to increase our applications knowledge  and to millipore form k 
table of contents part ii identify new technologies and customer needs 
this enables us to help optimize our customers productivity 
as a result  we expect our revenues related to a specific drug will increase over the various stages of the drug approval process  particularly  as the drug moves into later stage clinical trials and ultimately into commercial production 
our strategy our corporate strategy is to provide differentiated solutions to the life science research and biopharmaceutical manufacturing markets  which we believe have significant needs for new products that drive results  productivity improvements and new research goals 
since  our strategy has been organized around five objectives n strengthen our leadership position with biotechnology manufacturing customers by expanding our bioprocess product offerings  n establish millipore as a strategic supplier in bioscience research markets by increasing our laboratory productivity platforms and market reach  n lead our industry in product quality and manufacturing effectiveness  n attract  retain and develop talented and motivated employees  and n double the value of the company between and our bioscience division s strategy is to capitalize on its global infrastructure and core capabilities in filtration  reagents  and assay development to provide differentiated offerings in fast growing market segments 
the division pursues targeted  market specific strategies in laboratory water  drug discovery  and life science research 
the division leverages three expert sales organizations to execute the multiple segment strategy under one premium brand 
the bioprocess division s strategy is to leverage its leading position and broad portfolio of products to offer its biopharmaceutical customers integrated solutions that improve their productivity 
by enabling companies to move from a product centric approach to an integrated approach  the division can uniquely help customers increase their speed  lower their costs  minimize their risk  and increase their quality 
the division s global sales organization is focused on selling products  services  and applications expertise that provide its customers with a comprehensive approach to optimize their biopharmaceutical manufacturing process 
highlights we provide a wide range of products and services to a range of customers across a range of geographies 
the breadth of our business portfolio allows us to target growth on a number of dimensions  rather than relying on any single business  market  or economy 
in  we completed the integration of serologicals corporation serologicals into our business 
the proportion of our bioscience revenue to total revenue increased in as a result of including a full year of serologicals revenue  which had a greater percentage of its revenue derived from the life science research market 
since our bioprocess revenues tend to fluctuate with the timing of our customers major drug campaigns and finished goods inventory levels  a higher mix of bioscience revenues helps offset the effect of these fluctuations 
we also re branded the company and launched a new website and e business platform in our bioprocess division strengthened its core product portfolio and increased the number of new product launches from products in to products in these new products included new chromatography media with the highest capacity and flow rate now on the market and a new range of disposable mixers that combine technologies from companies we previously acquired 
our bioscience division also launched a new laboratory water product milli q advantage  which was one of our most successful product launches in terms of first year sales and customer orders

table of contents part ii the following table sets forth revenues derived from the bioprocess and bioscience divisions as a percentage of our total revenue 
year ended december  bioprocess bioscience total the composition of our geographic revenues is as follows year ended december  americas europe asia pacific total the performance of our broader business portfolio  the underlying growth of our business in europe and asia  and the execution of our strategy resulted in revenue growth 
bioprocess bioscience consolidated reported growth less foreign currency translation acquisitions organic growth consolidated revenue of  million for increased million  or percent  compared to the revenue increase included a percent favorable effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates and an percent favorable effect of business acquisitions 
adjusting for these items  our consolidated revenues for grew percent 
changes in product pricing had an insignificant effect on the year over year comparison 
the revenue growth came primarily from the strength in the life sciences research market and our downstream bioprocessing products 
after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  bioscience division revenue grew percent in compared to the primary drivers of this growth were higher sales of laboratory water products attributable to new product launches and our expansion into rapidly growing markets  such as china and india 
additionally  our drug discovery products that we acquired from serologicals were among the bioscience division s fastest growing products in the successful execution of our sales and marketing initiatives and the increased productivity in of our combined sales organization following the serologicals acquisition were also key factors causing this revenue growth 
the growth in the asian markets reflected the amount of research and development activities that are occurring in the region 
we expect bioscience division revenue growth to continue through our focus on marketing and re branding programs  a new e commerce sales channel  broadening distributor relationships  and new products 
after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  bioprocess division revenue grew percent in compared to the lower year over year growth rate was the result of lower purchases of our products from a limited number of our largest biotechnology customers in the us we believe these customers have re evaluated market demand for their products and are reducing inventory levels to lower costs and improve working capital 
these customers have also been restructuring operations  including closing manufacturing facilities  reducing manufacturing campaigns  and millipore form k 
table of contents part ii delaying expansion plans  which also contributed to lower sales of our products 
we expect this trend to continue into and to improve later in the year as these customers drug inventory levels and spending patterns become more normal 
despite the lower demand from these customers  we believe that the overall biotechnology industry remains healthy 
increasing levels of investment by private equity and large pharmaceutical companies  expected growth in commercially available antibodies  anticipated approvals of new biologic drugs and new indications of existing biologic drugs  new biologic manufacturing facilities  and expected overall biotechnology market growth are all trends that we anticipate will result in higher sales of our products in the long run 
our operating income increased compared to from million to million 
this was the result of higher sales volume  a more profitable business mix  productivity improvements associated with our supply chain initiatives  achievement of serologicals related integration cost synergies  and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
these factors resulted in an increase of our operating profit margin to percent from percent in diluted earnings per share eps of in increased compared to in addition to the higher operating income  the reversal of reserves related to uncertain tax positions upon the completion of tax examinations and statute of limitations closures contributed to the higher eps 
higher interest expense associated with a full year inclusion of serologicals financing costs somewhat offset these increases 
we generated million of operating cash flows in  which was a percent increase over during  we repaid million of our debt 
our focus on operating cash flow generation will continue in  which we expect to use primarily for debt reduction 
results of operations revenues net sales and percent sales growth by division  as compared with the prior years  is summarized in the table below year ended december  percent sales growth net sales by division in millions bioprocess bioscience total net sales and percent sales growth by geography  as compared with the prior years  is summarized in the table below year ended december  percent sales growth net sales by geography in millions americas europe asia pacific total bioprocess division versus bioprocess revenue of million for increased million  or percent  compared to the revenue increase included a percent favorable effect of foreign currency translation and a percent favorable effect of business acquisitions 
adjusting for these items  bioprocess revenues for grew percent 
our year over year revenue millipore form k 
table of contents part ii growth rate was adversely affected by reduction in purchases of our chromatography media and cell culture supplements products from a limited number of our key us customers in the second half 
revenue growth in was primarily attributable to higher sales of our products used in downstream bioprocessing  particularly our filtration and systems hardware and components products 
sales of our systems hardware and components products grew in because of our customers drug manufacturing campaigns occurring in europe and asia 
sales of our disposable systems and components products grew because more customers migrated to single use  disposable technologies that eliminate the need for cleaning stainless steel and glass equipment 
biopharmaceutical manufacturers also seek flexible manufacturing components and solutions because they enable reduced time between manufacturing runs and they can be configured and validated to meet customized biological manufacturing needs 
sales of our process monitoring tools  which are used to test for biopharmaceutical contaminants  increased because of the overall health of the biopharmaceutical markets in europe and asia 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific decreased million  increased million  and increased million  respectively  in compared to the americas decrease was primarily attributable to the sales decline of our chromatography media and cell culture supplements products 
the european and asia pacific increases were primarily attributable to higher sales of our downstream processing systems hardware products 
our core process filtration products also had strong growth in europe and asia pacific regions  particularly in china and india  which was the result of our direct investment in sales and marketing and infrastructure for these markets 
versus bioprocess revenue of million for increased million  or percent  compared to revenue growth was primarily attributable to business acquisitions and higher sales volume as a result of the strong demand for our differentiated products 
changes in foreign currency rates and product pricing had insignificant effects on the year over year comparisons 
revenue contributed by acquired businesses in represented approximately million  or percent  of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding business acquisitions  bioprocess division revenue increased million  or percent 
revenue growth was primarily attributable to strong demand for our core filtration and chromatography media products in the biotechnology market as a result of continued increase in biopharmaceutical production  particularly for monoclonal antibodies 
our customers are making investments to increase manufacturing capacity for biopharmaceutical drugs and expanding biotechnology product offerings through acquisitions and internal development 
revenue growth was also positively affected by increased sales of our novaseptum products  which are used by biotechnology customers for disposable sampling 
we acquired this product line early in the third quarter of this increased revenue level was an example of the effectiveness of our sales force at integrating acquired products into our existing distribution network 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the effects of acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific increased million  million  and million  respectively  in as compared to the americas and european increases were primarily driven by sales of our downstream bioprocessing products  such as our core process filtration and chromatography media products 
the majority of the remaining sales increase occurred in international growth markets  particularly in china and india 
these increases were the result of our direct investment in sales and marketing and infrastructure for these markets 
weaker market conditions for our products in japan somewhat offset the asia pacific market revenue growth 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii bioscience division versus bioscience revenue of million for increased million  or percent  compared to the revenue increase included a percent favorable effect of foreign currency translation and a percent favorable effect of business acquisitions 
adjusting for these items  bioscience revenue for grew percent 
this year over year increase was primarily driven by the overall strength of the life sciences research market and increased levels of life sciences research and development in both universities and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  particularly in international markets 
revenue growth in was primarily attributable to strong demand for our laboratory water products and higher sales of our life sciences products  such as analytical sample preparation and molecular biology products 
our successful implementation of initiatives designed to align sales and product management goals  to prioritize key customer relationships  and to execute targeted sales and marketing campaigns has positioned us well with our research customers 
our drug discovery business also grew in the second half  particularly in sales of multiplex immunoassays  because of strong market demand for such products 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and the acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe  and asia pacific increased million  million  and million  respectively  in compared to the increases in the americas and europe were primarily attributable to higher sales of laboratory water and drug discovery products 
the majority of the remaining sales increase occurred in international growth markets  particularly india and china 
this reflected the increased levels of life sciences research and the return on our continued investment in sales and marketing infrastructure in growing asia pacific markets 
versus bioscience revenue of million for increased million  or percent  compared to changes in foreign currency rates and product pricing had insignificant effects on the year over year comparisons 
the serologicals acquisition in represented approximately million  or percent  of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding the serologicals acquisition  bioscience division revenue increased million  or percent 
revenue growth was primarily attributable to higher demand for our laboratory water and life science filtration products  higher sales in growing international markets  and the impact of new products launched late in this growth was driven by increased levels of life science research and development occurring in both universities and pharmaceutical companies  particularly in north america 
the international market growth was also the result of higher sales of laboratory water products 
our customers are building and expanding their research laboratories in these markets and one of the first investments they make are in systems to produce purified water 
our successful implementation of initiatives designed to align sales and product management goals  to prioritize key customer relationships  and to launch targeted sales and marketing campaigns has positioned us well with these research customers  allowing us to serve them early in the drug development process 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the effects of serologicals  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific increased million  million  and million  respectively  in as compared to these increases were primarily driven by sales of our laboratory water and life science products  and in the case of china and india  our sales and marketing and infrastructure investments in these growth markets 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii gross profit margin year ended december  in millions gross profit percentage of sales versus gross profit increased million  or percent  in versus this was attributable to the increased sales volume  an improved business mix caused by a higher proportion of bioscience revenues in  productivity improvements and lower spending as a result of our supply chain initiatives  and lower amortization of business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments and lower acquisition integration costs related to the serologicals acquisition 
the higher sales volume was primarily caused by the full year inclusion of serologicals in our operating results compared to weeks in significant factors affecting the increase in our gross profit margin were the favorable business mix  lower costs associated with our manufacturing consolidation strategy primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs and accelerated depreciation amounting to million in compared to million in  lower amortization of business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments of million in compared to million in  and lower acquisition integration costs amounting to million in compared to million in somewhat offsetting the gross profit margin increase was the effect that the stronger euro had on translating the results of our significant manufacturing operations in ireland and france into us dollars 
this caused the cost of those operations to represent a higher proportion of our total manufacturing costs in amortization of acquired intangibles also lowered the gross profit margin  which amounted to million in compared to million in we expect full year amortization of acquired intangibles affecting gross profit to be approximately million and we plan to continue with our supply chain initiatives in  which will include the relocation of manufacturing operations and product lines 
versus gross profit increases in resulted from lower costs realized in connection with our ongoing manufacturing consolidation strategy and a business mix favoring our high margin bioscience division laboratory water products 
however  the gross profit margin declined percentage points as these increases were more than offset primarily by the amortization of business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments of million  or percentage points  amortization of intangible assets acquired of million  or percentage points  and acquisition integration costs of million  or percentage points 
costs associated with our manufacturing consolidation strategy primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs and accelerated depreciation also lowered our gross margins in both and these costs amounted to million in compared with million in stock based compensation charges associated with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r also had an unfavorable effect on the year over year comparisons 
sfas no 
r costs lowered gross profit by million in selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of sales millipore form k 
table of contents part ii versus selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to the sg a expense increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of serologicals sg a expenses in our operating results for the full year in compared to weeks in  significantly higher amortization of intangible assets  the unfavorable translation effect of the weaker us dollar  increased labor related costs attributable to our continued investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  and increased stock based compensation expense 
the increase in our average headcount was a significant driver of our sg a expense growth because employee related expenses represents over percent of our total sg a costs 
in  our average employee headcount increased approximately percent compared to amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets increased million to million in compared to million in we anticipate amortization expense affecting our sg a expenses to increase million 
serologicals integration costs were million in compared to million in the serologicals integration was completed in and therefore  we do not expect to incur integration costs in stock based compensation expense of million increased million  or percent  compared to because of changes we made to our equity compensation plans in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we anticipate stock based compensation expense to increase approximately million to million  of which million to million is expected to increase sg a expense 
in  we incurred million of expense related to an environmental liability and million of expense relating to the curtailment of our retirement plan 
these charges did not recur in versus sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to the primary drivers of the higher sg a expenses were the inclusion of serologicals expenses amounting to million  serologicals integration costs  significantly higher amortization of intangible assets  and sfas no 
r costs 
serologicals integration costs were million in and were primarily attributable to professional advisor fees  employee separations  and incremental travel 
amortization expense related to acquisitions increased million in compared to sg a also increased million in for estimated costs related to an existing environmental liability and million attributable to the curtailment of our retirement plan 
employee stock based compensation expenses contributed million to the year over year increase  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
additional drivers for higher sg a expenses were increased investments in international growth markets and increased headcount in both bioprocess and bioscience divisions to support our sales and marketing initiatives in research and development expenses year ended december  in millions research and development expenses percentage of sales versus research and development r d expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to higher r d expenses in were primarily attributable to the full year inclusion of serologicals r d expenses in our operating results in compared to weeks in  increased labor related costs attributable to increased headcount  and increased spending on new product development 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii versus r d expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to higher r d expenses in were primarily attributable to the inclusion of a half year of serologicals expenses amounting to million and related integration costs of million 
employee stock based compensation expense accounted for million of the year over year increase  which was the result of adopting sfas no 
r as of january  purchased in process research and development in  we wrote off million of purchased in process r d costs in connection with our novaseptic acquisition 
this represented the fair value of two r d projects that were still in development stage prior to reaching technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were discounted to the present value using a discount rate of percent 
interest income expense year ended december  in millions interest income interest expense average interest rate during the year versus interest income decreased million  or percent  in compared to this was the result of lower investment balances attributable to prior year sales of marketable securities 
the proceeds of those sales were used  in part  to fund our serologicals acquisition on july  interest expense increased million  or percent  in compared to this increase was attributable to a full year of interest in related to our million percent convertible senior notes and our million percent senior notes issued in june to fund the acquisition of serologicals 
the effect of higher average interest rates in were partially offset by a lower overall debt balance as we continued to repay our debt 
our revolving credit facility is comprised of floating rate borrowings based on libor 
increases or decreases in these rates cause increases or decreases to our interest expense  respectively 
in august  the financial accounting standards board the fasb proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement the proposed fsp 
the public comment period for the proposed fsp ended in october the fasb has not issued any final standards to date 
the proposed fsp would require the proceeds from the issuance of such convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
if adopted  the proposed fsp would change the accounting treatment for our million of percent convertible senior notes that were issued in june such a change would impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and could result in an increase to our non cash interest expense beginning in and for financial statements covering the and fiscal years 
we cannot determine whether or not such accounting treatment will eventually be adopted by the fasb 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii versus interest income increased million in compared to we earned interest income as a result of investing the proceeds of borrowings under our revolver in december and under our percent convertible senior notes and the percent senior notes issued in june in connection with the acquisition of serologicals until the consummation of the acquisition 
interest expense increased million in compared to the increases were primarily attributable to a full year of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as well as borrowings under the percent convertible senior notes and the percent senior notes issued in june in connection with the serologicals acquisition 
the serologicals acquisition in july was financed with the borrowings under these debt instruments 
initial revolver borrowings occurred in december in connection with the repatriation of earnings under the american jobs creation act 
commitment fees of million associated with a bridge loan commitment we secured in connection with the serologicals acquisition also contributed to the interest expense increase in compared to provision for income taxes year ended december  effective income tax rate versus the effective income tax rates for  and reflected the tax benefit associated with lower tax rates on international earnings  which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states 
the decrease in the effective tax rate compared to was primarily attributable to the release of tax reserves amounting to million and a pretax income mix favoring lower tax rate jurisdictions in lower us pretax profits as a result of reduced purchases from our large us biotechnology customers and significantly higher expenses for interest and amortization were the primary causes of the mix shift 
in addition  the shift in the mix of our pretax income was also the result of the continued shift of our production activities to ireland in accordance with the manufacturing consolidation strategy 
in  we anticipate a higher effective income tax rate because of forecasted levels of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to our profit mix 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
in  the irs completed the examination phase of years and and commenced an examination of years and in  the irs continued the examination phase of years and although the and examinations were not settled at december   we believe appropriate provision was made for any potential unfavorable financial statement impact upon settlement of each of these years 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease net income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
versus the significant decrease in the effective tax rate compared to was attributable to our repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of the income tax provision was lower  and the effective tax rate was percentage points lower  than as a result of the repatriation 
the effective tax rate was also lowered by significant serologicals integration costs incurred in the united states in the second half of the year and costs surrounding the transfer of production activities from puerto rico  both of which caused a shift of pre tax income to lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to millipore form k 
table of contents part ii net income and diluted earnings per share year ended december  in millions  except share data net income diluted earnings per share versus net income increased million  or percent  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of higher operating income and the lower effective tax rate  somewhat offset by higher interest expense associated with the financing of the serologicals acquisition 
diluted earnings per share increased  or percent  in compared to the increase was the result of the reasons discussed above 
versus net income increased million  or percent  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of lower effective tax rate  higher interest income  and higher operating income 
net income in was also adversely affected by higher interest expense associated with the financing of the serologicals acquisition 
diluted earnings per share increased  or percent  in as compared to the increase was the result of the reasons discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity the following table shows information about our capitalization as of the dates indicated total capitalization in millions  except ratio amounts december  december  cash and cash equivalents total debt total capitalization debt plus equity debt to total capitalization we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operations  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  employee benefit plans  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is partly a function of our existing debt to capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 
our credit ratings are reviewed regularly by major debt rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investors service 
our senior unsecured notes are rated bbb by standard poor s and ba by moody s investors service and our revolving credit facility is rated bbb and baa by standard and poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our senior convertible notes are rated bb by standard poor s and have not been rated by moody s investors service

table of contents part ii we believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs 
furthermore  our ability to obtain equity financing  as well as availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required 
in  we reduced our cash balances reflecting our focus on debt repayment 
we intend to continue to maintain our cash balances at a level that reflects the minimum operating needs of our subsidiaries in which we conduct our business 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from our subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to our net income of million and non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expenses of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments of million 
offsetting this were uses of operating cash flows attributable to deferred income tax benefits of million and working capital of million 
our deferred income tax benefits were the result of a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets from business acquisitions  which are not tax deductible  and higher net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the increase in our net working capital was primarily attributable to decreases in accrued expenses of million resulting from the timing of accrued interest payments  employee separation payments and facility payments associated with the serologicals acquisition  reductions of retirement plan contributions as a result of the change in our plans  and overall decreases in accrued general expenses 
we also used operating cash flow to fund increased inventory levels amounting to million attributable to increased safety stock levels required in connection with our manufacturing consolidation strategy and inventories associated with new products 
in the second half  we managed cash collections and disbursements to maximize cash available for debt reduction 
the increased inventory balances discussed above caused the number of days supply in ending inventory to increase days to days at december  compared to days at december  the number of days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable remained the same at days at december  compared with december   showing our continued focus on cash collections 
investing cash flows cash used for investing activities was million during compared with  million during the decrease was primarily attributable to our acquisition of serologicals in during  we paid million for capital expenditures and million for the settlement of a forward exchange contract used to hedge our exposure to millipore form k 
table of contents part ii foreign exchange risks associated with certain european borrowings 
we also received million for the sale of property  plant and equipment  primarily facilities we acquired from serologicals 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million for financing cash flows cash used in financing activities was million during compared with cash provided by financing activities of million during the decrease was primarily attributable to the debt we raised in for our july  acquisition of serologicals 
repayments of debt in included repayment of our million percent ten year unsecured notes and net revolver repayments of million 
cash used in financing activities was partially offset by cash received from employees upon the exercise of stock options amounting to million 
financing commitments short term debt short term debt at december  consisted of borrowings under our operating bank facilities 
short term debt at december  consisted of our percent ten year unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of million 
these notes were due on april  and were paid off  including accrued interest of million  with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility we entered into an agreement for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver in december the acquisition of serologicals on july  and the related financing required us to change certain terms of the revolver agreement 
accordingly  we amended the agreement in june some of which became effective on july  to n permit the consummation of the serologicals acquisition and issuance and incurrence of certain additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition  n extend the maturity date to june   n require interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on specified credit ratings  n require the pledge of substantially all our assets to secure our obligations under the revolver if specified credit rating levels are reached  and n adjust certain restrictions and financial covenants 
we further amended the revolver agreement in july to increase the borrowing availability under the domestic facility from million  or million  to million  or million 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million of deferred financing costs associated with amending the revolver agreement 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging between percent and percent annually based on the revolver s debt rating 
we are required to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios as set forth in the revolver agreement 
the agreement also includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to merge  consolidate  or sell assets  to create liens  to make payments in respect of capital stock or subordinated debt  as well as other customary covenants and representations 
in general  the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing our total outstanding indebtedness at december  by our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  the interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  by our cumulative gross interest expense for the twelve months ended at december  the definitions of the factors used to calculate these leverage and interest coverage ratios are included in the revolver agreement 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii the following table summarizes the financial covenant requirements as of december  and thereafter and our compliance with these covenants as of december  covenant requirement actual at december  maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio our ability to continue to comply with these covenants will depend primarily on the success in growing our business and generating substantial operating cash flow 
future compliance with the covenants may be adversely affected by various economic  financial  and industry factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the revolver  allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of any potential failure by us to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  we would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or to obtain compliance waivers from our lenders 
as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under the revolver of million  which were classified as long term debt because of our intent and ability to continuously refinance them 
as of december   we had million  or million  available for borrowing under the revolver 
convertible senior notes due in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the convertible notes in a private placement offering 
the convertible notes bear interest at percent per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
commencing with the six month period beginning on december   if the average trading price of the convertible notes for the five consecutive trading days preceding such six month periods equals percent or more of the principal amount  contingent interest will accrue at the rate of percent of the average trading price of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the convertible notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables

at december   our foreign retirement plans were under funded by million 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million in amounts included in the table above for employee pension and postretirement medical plans reflect projected benefit payments 
our future pension expense and pension liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in future discount rates as well as the fair market value of assets used to fund these plans

the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all of the criteria specified in securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
these criteria include n evidence of an arrangement is in place  n related prices are fixed or determinable  n delivery or performance has occurred  and n collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii customer purchase orders or sales agreements evidence our sales arrangements 
these purchase orders and sales agreements specify both selling prices and quantities  which are the basis for recording sales revenue 
trade terms for the majority of our sales contracts indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to our customer when we ship products from our facilities  which is when revenue is recognized 
revenue is deferred until our products arrive at customers facilities in situations where trade terms indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers upon their receipt of our products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and ship products only to customers that satisfy our credit evaluation 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
standard consumable and hardware products account for over percent of our total consolidated revenues and are typically sold with standard terms and conditions 
revenues for these products are generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customers 
in instances where we sell filtration systems products with a related installation obligation  we generally recognize revenue related to the filtration systems when title passes and recognize revenue related to the installation when installation is complete 
the allocation of revenue between the filtration system and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
in limited cases  our customers may require site acceptance testing for certain customized products built to customers specifications 
revenues on these products are deferred upon shipment and are recognized when site acceptance testing is completed 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
for laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation testing services provided to customers  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is completed and accepted by the customer 
for sample analysis services provided to customers  revenue is recognized as each sample analysis is completed 
for assay development and assay validation services provided to customers  revenue is recognized on a proportional performance model as contractually defined deliverables are provided to the customer 
revenue for fixed price contracts associated with our large  custom process equipment business is recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
approximately percent of our revenue was derived from poc sales in revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent completed is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that assumptions used in calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
if it is estimated that the project will result in a loss when completed  the entire loss is recognized at that point 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to recover expenses incurred with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically  such progress payments can range between percent and percent of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
we recognize license and royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable and we have fulfilled our obligations under the applicable agreement 
this generally occurs when cash payments are received or licensed sales are reported to us 
inventory valuation 
our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  we generally rely upon recent historic usage  expiration dates  and estimated future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  such as for newly introduced products and overstocked products  estimated future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also millipore form k 
table of contents part ii reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  estimated future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  reflected cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross profit margin 
once recorded  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed unless the related inventory items are subsequently sold 
valuation of long lived assets 
valuation of certain long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill 
assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 
we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques  such as the income approach and the cost approach  as appropriate  in establishing the fair value of long lived assets 
typically  key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following n significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  n significant negative industry or economic trends  or n significant changes or developments in strategy or operations which affect our intellectual or tangible properties 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
we perform annual reviews in our second quarter for impairment of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and cash earnings multiples  and compare the values to our estimated overall market capitalization 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which required us to recognize share based payments to employees and directors as compensation expense using a fair value based method in the results of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r and as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  no stock based employee compensation expense had been recorded in connection with the issuance of employee and director stock options as all options granted under these plans were fixed awards and had an exercise millipore form k 
table of contents part ii price equal to the market value of our common stock at the time of the grant 
stock based employee compensation expense relating to separation agreements for certain executive officers and the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted at no cost to the employees was reflected in net income 
we used the modified prospective method when we adopted sfas no 
r and  accordingly  did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
in the year ended december   compensation expense of million was recognized for all awards granted on or after january  as well as for the unvested portion of awards granted before january  stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock at the time of grant 
we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options 
the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise  post vesting cancellation and expiration patterns of our stock options 
expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions are updated at least on an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
income taxes 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   we had valuation allowances of  related to federal research credits   related to state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards   related to capital loss carryforward  and  related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
we are a worldwide business 
we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
because significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  we periodically assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
we believe our tax reserves are necessary to appropriately reflect tax obligations that may arise out of current and future audits 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the irs 
in  the irs continued the examination phase of years and although the examinations were not settled at december   we believe an appropriate provision was made for any potential unfavorable financial statement impact 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us the earnings of our ireland  united kingdom and sweden subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested outside the us these elections were made based on our operating plans and foreign debt service requirements 
employee retirement plans 
in the us  we sponsor a pension plan and a postretirement medical plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several key assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans  typically on an annual basis 
for the pension plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan 
this included considering the trusts asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the assumed discount rate is intended to approximate the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled 
we used the citigroup pension discount curve as the benchmark rate for estimating our discount rate for pension expense 
in addition  we update  as needed  other assumptions used in determining the expense and liabilities of the plan  such as withdrawal and mortality assumptions based on the average age grouping of our plan participants and updated mortality tables published by the society of actuaries 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we recognized our pension expense using a discount rate of percent and an expected return on plan assets of percent related to our us pension plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us pension plan were the discount rates and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they were the most sensitive assumptions  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
for the postretirement medical plan  significant assumptions included the discount rate  the future medical cost escalation rate  withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual results because of changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of postretirement medical expense recorded by us 
during  we recognized our expense using a discount rate of percent and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from percent in to percent in although these are the most sensitive assumptions  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
in certain foreign subsidiaries  we also sponsor pension plans for our employees 
accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country specific assumptions for discount rates  expected returns on assets  and rates of compensation increases 
we apply a consistent methodology  year over year  in determining the key assumptions 
our discount rates are based on high quality bond indices for durations that approximate the average remaining service periods of our plan participants in each country 
we select expected long term rates of return on assets based on the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under these plans 
although the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our foreign pension plans are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii in the fourth quarter  our board of directors approved an amendment to the retirement plan for employees of millipore corporation the retirement plan and the employees participation and savings plan the participation plan 
the effect of the amendment was to freeze the retirement plan effective december   after which no benefits will accrue 
we provided eligible participants a one time final opportunity in early to transfer balances in their participation plan accounts to the retirement plan for the purpose of purchasing an annuity under the existing terms of the retirement plan 
we recognized a curtailment loss of million in the fourth quarter as a result of this amendment 
we used an assumption that percent of available balances in the participation plan as of december  would be transferred into the retirement plan for purposes of determining the curtailment loss associated with the amendment 
the percent assumption was selected based on a review of our actual transfer experience for the period 
actual transfer experience was analyzed to determine the percentage by age grouping of available participation plan balances that were transferred to the retirement plan 
these percentages were then applied to projected balances by age grouping as of december  to determine the estimated balances that would be transferred by age grouping 
upon completion of the transfer of participation plan balances as of july   the actual transfers represented percent of the final participation plan asset balance as of that time 
the percent actual transfer experience had no impact on expense because the actuarial loss attributable to the actual transfer percent exceeding the percent transfer rate assumption will be amortized over the average remaining service period of plan participants beginning in the balances disclosed at december  for benefit obligations and plan assets reflect the impact of the actual transfers from the participation plan 
market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate risk  and credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in sales  net income  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates represents a substantial risk to us because approximately percent of our business was conducted outside of the united states for the year ended december   generally in foreign currencies 
our primary risk management strategy is to use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of this strategy is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying booked exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward exchange contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen  and great britain pound 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
this depends on the use of the derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an effective hedge 
as of december   we had open forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted intercompany sales with total us dollar equivalent notional amounts of approximately million 
these forward exchange millipore form k 
table of contents part ii contracts are generally short term in nature and mature through february based on our analysis  a hypothetical adverse foreign exchange rate movement of percent against our forward exchange contracts would have resulted in a net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million at december  all such losses on these forward exchange contracts would be substantially offset by gains on the underlying transactions that were hedged 
in addition  we also hold forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange risk related to certain foreign currency denominated receivable and payable balances 
changes in fair value of these forward exchange contracts are recorded through current earnings because these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   the us dollar equivalent notional amounts of the forward exchange contracts related to foreign currency denominated receivable and payable balances totaled million 
the periods of these forward exchange contracts typically span less than three months 
the fair value of these forward exchange contracts was a net loss of million at december  during  we entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk related to foreign currency denominated debt 
the initial forward exchange contracts matured in october  resulting in a realized loss of million 
at the same time  we entered into additional forward exchange contracts  which were outstanding at december  and mature in april at december   these forward exchange contracts had an aggregate us dollar equivalent notional amount of million and an aggregate us dollar equivalent fair value of a net loss of million 
the net realized and unrealized losses on these forward exchange contracts were substantially offset by gains on the underlying transactions  which resulted in a net gain of million in our risk management policy allows for hedging our net investments in foreign subsidiaries  using both derivative and non derivative instruments 
in june  we issued million of euro denominated senior notes which gives rise to foreign exchange risk when the debt is remeasured into us dollars at the end of each period 
the remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income because we designated this debt as an economic hedge of our net investments in european subsidiaries 
upon maturity  however  we could be exposed to significant exchange rate risk because we will be required to repay the debt at the then current market exchange rates  which could be higher than the rates at which we borrowed the debt in june as of december   we have recorded a cumulative loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the change in value of the us dollar versus the euro since the issuance of the notes 
a further percent strengthening or weakening of the euro against the us dollar will cause this cumulative loss to increase or decrease by million 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which affect our debt as well as cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   our debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our revolving credit facilities  under which the interest rates on our borrowings float with libor rates 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by percent  the fair value of our long term debt would decrease or increase by approximately million 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and forward exchange contracts 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited because of our large number of established customers and their dispersion across different geographies 
no single customer accounted for percent or more of our consolidated trade receivables as of december  we are exposed to credit risk on our hedging instruments in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties because our hedging activities are transacted only with financial institutions with high credit ratings
