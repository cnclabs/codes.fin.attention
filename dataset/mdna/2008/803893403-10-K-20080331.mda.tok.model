recent developments on october   we entered into an offer to sell notes with all of the holders of our then outstanding senior secured convertible notes the convertible notes 
under the terms of the offer  at anytime prior to november   we had the right to purchase the convertible notes for an amount equal to of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
in exchange for the holders agreement to keep the offer open until november   we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the holders 
we recorded a charge to operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter ended december  related to such issuance 
on october   we entered into a note purchase agreement with rockport capital partners ii  lp and ngp energy technology partners  lp the investors to lend us up to million to provide funds to repurchase the convertible notes  among other things 
pursuant to the note purchase agreement  on november   the investors purchased from us promissory notes the new notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the new notes bore interest at per annum 
all unpaid principal  together with accrued but unpaid interest  was due and payable in full on february   unless prepaid earlier 
the new notes were paid off in full on december  on november   we used approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of the new notes to retire the convertible notes  which represented of the then outstanding amount due under the convertible notes 
we recorded a charge to operations in the fourth quarter ended december  of approximately million  which represents the prepayment penalty under the convertible notes 
upon the retirement of the convertible notes  the new notes became immediately secured by all of our assets  including our ownership interest in the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
on november   we entered into a stock and warrant purchase agreement with the investors 
under this purchase agreement  the investors agreed to purchase in a private placement up to  shares of our newly created series c convertible preferred stock the series c preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  for an aggregate gross purchase price of million 
each share of series c preferred stock initially converts into common stock at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment 
this private placement occurred in two closings 
the first closing occurred on november  at the first closing  we issued  shares of series c preferred stock at  per share for an aggregate gross purchase price of million 
these shares are currently convertible into  shares of common stock 
we also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
these warrants had an initial exercise price of per share and may not be exercised until may  as a result of stockholder approval of the second closing and related matters on december   as described below  the exercise price of these warrants was reduced to per share 
at the second closing  which occurred on december  following stockholder approval  we issued  shares of series c preferred stock for an aggregate gross purchase price of million  of which million was paid through the cancellation of short term notes previously issued to the investors on november  these shares are currently convertible into  shares of common stock 
at this closing  we also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants are exercisable immediately 
in the purchase agreement  we also agreed to issue the investors additional warrants in the event that the holders of certain existing warrants none of whom are affiliated with the investors exercise those warrants in the future 
upon such exercises  we will issue to the investors additional warrants to purchase common stock equal to one half of the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of these existing warrants 
the exercise price of these warrants will be per share 
as of february   if all of these existing warrants are exercised  we would need to issue warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock to the investors 
as a result of our sale of series c preferred stock and warrants  the holders of our warrant as and warrant cs had a limited period of time days after each issuance  at their election  to require us to redeem those warrants based on a black scholes option pricing model on the date of notification 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid approximately million to redeem warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid approximately million to redeem warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock 
following these redemptions  as of february   warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock remain outstanding 
the redemption periods under the warrant as and warrant cs associated with our sale of series c preferred stock and related warrants have expired 
on february   we entered into a new loan and security agreement the new loan agreement with the silicon valley bank the bank 
under the terms of the loan agreement  the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line up to million 
the new loan agreement is secured by most of our assets and advances under the loan agreement are limited to of eligible receivables and the lesser of of the value of our eligible inventory  as defined  or million 
interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus the prime rate margin  as defined  or the libor rate plus the libor rate margin  as defined

the new loan agreement  if not terminated sooner in accordance with its terms  expires on february  overview we design and manufacture enabling technologies and products for electrical power conversion and control for high performance  high efficiency applications in large  growth markets such as alternative energy  hybrid electric vehicles  distributed power generation  power quality  semiconductor fabrication capital equipment  industrial motors and drives  and high reliability defense electronics 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable reserves  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets  contract losses and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our audit committee 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are typically shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments 
if the product requires installation to be performed by us  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
if the product requires specific customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse  unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
when appropriate  we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
if a contract involves the provisions of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation under eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  total estimated contact revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided 
the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is recognized on each element as described above 
we perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and  in some situations  the payment of a fee 
these contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget 
on fixed price contracts  revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
the defense contract audit agency has agreed upon the final indirect cost rates for the fiscal year ended september  when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
as of december  and  we have accrued approximately million and  respectively  for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses 
deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed  product shipped or installation completed 
unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as based on historical usage 
due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products  demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
values were assigned to goodwill and intangible assets based on third party independent valuations  as well as management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement affects our treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement requires impairment tests be periodically repeated and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
additionally  existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified within the statement s criteria 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives ceased 
we determine the fair value of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow income approach 
the income approach indicates the fair value of a business enterprise based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future 
this analysis is largely based upon projections prepared by us and data from sources of publicly available information available at the time of preparation 
these projections are based on management s best estimate of future results 
in making these projections  we consider the markets we are addressing  the competitive environment and our advantages 
there will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected  and those differences may be material 
in addition  we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows 
long lived assets we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for possible impairment  if certain conditions exist  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
we determine the fair value of certain of the long lived assets based on a discounted cash flow income approach 
the income approach indicates the fair value of a long lived assets based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the long lived asset can be expected to generate in the future over the life of the long lived asset 
this analysis is based upon projections prepared by us 
these projections represent management s best estimate of future results 
in making these projections  we consider the markets we are addressing  the competitive environment and our advantages 
there will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected  and those differences may be material 
in addition  we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows 
convertible debt instruments and warrant liabilities we accounted for our senior secured convertible notes the convertible notes  which were paid off on november   and associated warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the convertible notes included features that qualify as embedded derivatives  such as i the holders conversion option  ii our option to settle the convertible notes at the scheduled dates in cash or shares of our common stock and iii premiums and penalties we would be liable to pay in the event of default 
as permitted under sfas  we irrevocably elected  as of january   to measure the convertible notes in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either gain or loss 
subsequent to the pay off of the convertible notes  we will continue to account for the associated warrants as described above 
we recorded interest expense under the convertible notes based on the greater of i or ii the six month libor  in effect at the time plus basis points  as well as the amortization of the debt discount  which we computed using the effective interest method 
the debt discount represents the difference between our gross proceeds of million and the fair value of the convertible debt upon issuance  after separately valuing the investor warrants  the placement agent warrants and the convertible notes on a relative fair value basis 
by amortizing the debt discount to interest expense  rather than recognizing it as a change in fair value of the convertible debt instrument and warrants  which is a separate line item in our statement of operations  we believe our interest expense line item more appropriately reflects the cost of the debt associated with our convertible notes 
we determined the fair values of the convertible notes  investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the convertible notes and related warrants 
an increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of both the convertible notes and warrants to increase  because the conversion and exercise prices  respectively  of such instruments are fixed at and per share  respectively  and result in a charge to our statement of operations 
a decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the convertible notes and the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations 
if the price of our common stock were to decline significantly  however  the decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes would be limited by the instrument s debt characteristics 
under such circumstances  our estimated cost of capital would become another significant variable affecting the fair value of the convertible notes 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
convertible series c preferred stock we account for our convertible series c preferred stock the series c preferred stock  and associated warrants in accordance with in accordance with eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible series c preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors  and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities 
we determined the initial value of the series c preferred stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
the re pricing of the exercise price of the first tranche warrants from to  as described above  was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on november  and a re issuance or new warrants on december  the difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the series c preferred stock on december  we treated this as a deemed dividend on the series c preferred stock 
as of december  we recorded  as a deemed dividend to the holders of the series c preferred stock  which included the beneficial conversion feature of  and  related to the accretion of the series c preferred stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the series c preferred stock may first exercise their redemption right 
we are using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the series c preferred stock through november   at which time the value of the series c preferred stock would be million  of its face value

this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in overhead costs during the period in our power systems  us division and  in part  by a decrease in the cost of product revenue due to a decrease in revenue and lower material and overhead costs during the period in our electronics division 
in our power systems  us division  a majority of the costs associated with a three phase staresine unit  for which revenue was recognized in had been written down in prior periods resulting in the better than planned margins in our power systems  us division 
in our power systems  canada division  the increase in costs is mainly due to the increase in revenues from to  along with increased material component cost  labor costs and the effects of the increase in the canadian dollar over the past year 
in addition  the increase includes the write off of approximately million related to cost overruns in the production of several prototype units for the navy  for which we are seeking some economic relief due to design changes  increases in major component costs and increases in anticipated exchange rates  we have not booked any benefit for such relief as of december  gross margin

based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we believe that our current cash  as well as the availability from our new line of credit with silicon valley bank  will be adequate to fund our operations through december  in the long run  we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow  which we expect to improve as we improve our operating margins and grow our business 
we also expect to rely on our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments 
our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line 
if either of those events occur  we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position  which could include selling of certain assets  delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions in the preferred stock financing with the investors and in the new credit facility with silicon valley bank 
such actions would likely require the consent of the investors and or silicon valley bank  and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required 
if additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution 
the terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially  adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of the preferred stock financing  the holders of certain outstanding warrants had the right for a limited period of time days after each closing to seek redemption of those warrants at their black scholes value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid approximately million to redeem warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid approximately million to redeem warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock 
following these redemptions  as of february   warrant as representing  shares of common stock and warrant cs representing  shares of common stock remain outstanding 
the redemption periods under these warrants associated with our preferred stock financing have expired 
if these redemption rights are triggered again in the future as a result of subsequent equity issuances below per share  our liquidity position would be adversely impacted 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products 
these costs have exceeded total revenue 
as a result  we have incurred losses in each of the past five years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
since inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt  public security offerings  borrowings under our previous line of credit and capital equipment leases 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  including restricted cash and cash equivalents of million  this represents increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately million from the million on hand at december  cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately million offset by non cash items such as the change in the fair value of the convertible notes and placement agent fees  depreciation and amortization  deferred revenue  increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory  non cash compensation and consulting expense  non cash interest expense and decreases in working capital 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities during the fiscal years ended december  and december   was a result of capital expenditures during each of the respective periods 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended december  we recorded approximately million related to the sale of our splc technology
