item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s nw natural financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the three years ended december  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nw natural  which principally consist of our regulated local gas distribution business  our regulated gas storage business  and other regulated and non regulated investments primarily in energy related businesses  including our wholly owned subsidiaries  nng financial corporation financial corporation and gill ranch storage  llc gill ranch 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated gas distribution business  and the term non utility is used to describe our gas storage business gas storage and our other non regulated investments and business activities other segment  including investments in a recently announced intrastate pipeline project in oregon palomar pipeline see strategic opportunities  below  and note 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this section to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
executive summary highlights of net income increased percent to million  and diluted earnings per share increased percent to per share  net operating revenues from our utility increased percent to million  net operating revenues from our gas storage business increased percent to million  cash flow from operations increased percent to million  reflecting strong earnings and deferred gas cost savings  ranked best in the west and second best nationally in overall residential customer satisfaction among gas utilities according to a jd power and associates survey  conservation tariff and weather normalization mechanisms were extended in oregon through october  smart energy program  a carbon offset billing option for customers  was implemented as the first program of its kind for a standalone gas company to address greenhouse gas emissions  announced plans to develop investments in a natural gas transmission pipeline in oregon and an underground gas storage facility in central california see strategic opportunities  below  mist storage capacity was expanded by bcf to approximately bcf  and  quarterly common stock dividend rate increased percent to per share in the fourth quarter of  making this the nd consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders 

table of contents our primary businesses consist of our regulated utility and gas storage 
factors critical to the success of the utility business include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of gas  providing distribution services at a competitive price  and being able to recover the operating and capital costs of the utility in the rates charged to customers 
the utility is regulated by two state commissions  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
factors critical to the success of our gas storage business segment include the ability to develop additional storage capacity at competitive market prices  plan for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve its core customers in the future  and obtain timely and reasonable rate changes 
our gas storage businesses charge rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the gill ranch project is expected to be subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission cpuc  if completed 
outlook in  management expects to focus on the following four areas core business improvement 
we plan to incorporate new technology into our operations while honing new processes established in the recent changes to our operating model 
our goal is to integrate and to streamline operations and provide our employees with tools to become even more effective and efficient 
strategic position 
in our rapidly changing business environment  we will strive to continue achieving shareholder value while balancing the interests of our customers and communities 
in doing so  we will continue to develop plans in response to potential climate change legislation as well as to address regulatory  business development and workforce challenges and opportunities 
business development 
we intend to advance our key natural gas infrastructure investments  such as the palomar pipeline and gill ranch storage projects  while exploring new growth opportunities 
see strategic opportunities  below 
organizational effectiveness 
as employees are our most highly valued resource  we intend to continue to support our employees with well defined practices  training and technology to achieve our goals 
issues  challenges and performance measures managing the business in a period of gas price volatility 
our gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility s core customers 
equally important  however  is our strategy to hedge gas prices for a significant portion of our annual purchase requirements based upon the market outlook and our core utility s gas load forecast 
we believe we have sufficient supplies of natural gas under contract to meet the needs of our core customers  but price increases could change our earnings outlook and our competitive advantage 
if gas prices increase  it could affect our ability to add residential and commercial customers and could result in industrial customers shifting their businesses energy needs to alternative fuel sources 
we continue to develop new gas acquisition strategies to manage gas prices and to efficiently meet market demands 
customer growth 
our growth is largely driven by new residential construction  and while we expect to continue with a customer growth rate above the national average for local gas distribution companies due to the growing market in the pacific northwest  we have experienced a slowdown in 
table of contents new construction which is expected to continue through for the months ended december   our annual growth rate was percent  compared to percent for the comparable period ended december  a prolonged slowdown in residential new construction could adversely impact our future results of operations 
strategic opportunities business process redesign 
to address these economic and competitive challenges we will continue to evaluate our business processes and costs in our new operating model and to improve those processes where long term efficiencies could be gained 
we targeted a number of areas where we could restructure to gain efficiencies  including more centralization and more standardized processes 
to date  we are on schedule to meet the target workforce reductions of to employees by late we are also currently completing the implementation of the first phase of a new integrated information system  with the second phase of the new system installation expected to commence early in these technology investments are expected to help facilitate additional business initiatives  as well as help to improve overall operational efficiencies throughout nw natural 
pipeline diversity 
in september  we announced that we were evaluating a possible equity investment in a natural gas transmission pipeline that would connect transcanada gas transmission northwest s gtn interstate transmission line to our local gas distribution system palomar pipeline 
the proposed pipeline is intended to diversify our gas delivery options  including the enhancement of reliability for our customers by providing an alternate transportation path for  and an alternative gas supply source to  gas purchases in alberta and  including the possible delivery of supplies from a liquefied natural gas lng facility that is proposed on the columbia river 
in august  we entered into an agreement with gtn for the purpose of developing  designing  permitting  constructing and owning the pipeline 
during the planning and permitting phase we expect to contribute our percent of the estimated million for permitting and planning  which is anticipated to occur during the period 
we believe there is sufficient interest from potential pipeline users to warrant proceeding with the permitting phase of the project 
we  along with gtn  will determine at a later date whether to proceed with development of the project beyond the permitting phase 
if constructed  we estimate the total cost for the entire mile pipeline to be between million and million 
northernstar llc  developer of a proposed bradwood landing lng terminal on the columbia river  may elect to take capacity on the palomar pipeline should the bradwood landing terminal and the palomar pipeline be constructed 
gas storage development 
in september  we announced a joint project with pacific gas electric company pg e to develop an underground natural gas storage facility near fresno  california 
we formed gill ranch  a wholly owned subsidiary of nw natural  to develop and operate the facility 
gill ranch will initially own percent of this storage project and pg e will own percent 
the new storage facility is expected to provide approximately bcf of underground gas storage capacity  and will include miles of transmission pipeline  when the initial phase is completed 
we estimate our share of the total cost for the initial phase of development to be between million and million over the next three years  which represents percent of the estimated total project cost 
we conducted an open season to gauge interest in the storage facility from october to december  and the results indicated a strong level of interest in gas storage at gill ranch from potential storage customers 
we expect to file an application with the cpuc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity in mid and  if granted  gill ranch will be subject to cpuc regulation with respect  among other things  to rates  the issuance of securities  lien grants and sales of property 
we expect the initial phase of gill ranch to be in service by late

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates or judgments involve regulatory cost recovery  revenue recognition  derivative instruments  pension assumptions  income taxes and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from or refund them to customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 

table of contents the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
 which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
we continue to apply sfas no 
in accounting for our regulated utility operations 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of sfas no 
for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
see note  industry regulation 
revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to lower gas prices included in customer rates 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
utility revenues may also include the recognition of a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid see results of operations regulatory matters regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
this revenue adjustment reflects an opuc rule whereby we are required to implement a rate refund or a rate surcharge to utility customers 
this automatic refund or surcharge is accrued based on the estimated difference between income taxes paid and income taxes authorized to be collected in rates for the tax year 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from our optimization partner are recognized over the life of the optimization contract for the guaranteed amount  or are recognized as they are earned for amounts above the guaranteed value 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our financial derivatives policy and gas acquisition policy set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies within designated 
table of contents parameters 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that qualify as derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to sfas no 
see note  industry regulation and no gain or loss is recognized in current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument that is subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for gains and losses is made in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 collectively referred to as sfas no 
see note  derivatives and industry regulation 
our estimate of fair value is determined from period to period based on an internal discounted cash flow model for swap contracts and on a black scholes model for option contracts 
the estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may have an impact on our results of operations  but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair values at december  and  see note commodity based derivative contracts entered into by the utility after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon  with percent of unrealized gains and losses recorded to a regulatory asset or liability account 
the remaining percent is recognized in current income for contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting or is recognized in other comprehensive income for contracts qualifying for hedge accounting 
an interest rate swap qualifies for hedge accounting under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a number of financial derivatives related to commodity purchases by the utility after our pga filing 
the million loss was reversed during in the cost of gas when the derivative contract settled 
derivative contracts are subjected to a hedge effectiveness test to determine the financial statement treatment of each specific derivative 
as of december   all of our derivatives were effective economic hedges and either qualified or were expected to qualify for regulatory deferral  or hedge accounting treatment 
we utilize the hypothetical derivative method under sfas no 
to determine the hedge effectiveness of our interest rate swap and the dollar offset method under sfas no 
for all other derivative contracts 
the effectiveness test applied to financial derivatives is dependent on the type of derivative and its use 
the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps utility net loss on commodity price options utility subtotal on commodity utility net gain on foreign currency forward purchases utility total realized net gain loss 
table of contents realized gains losses from commodity hedges and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market valuations are generally not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  which are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees and other employee postretirement benefit plans 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans have plan assets  which are held in a qualified trust to fund retirement benefits 
effective january   the retirement plan for non bargaining unit employees and the welfare benefits plan for non bargaining unit employees were closed to anyone hired or rehired after december  instead  newly hired or rehired non bargaining unit employees are provided an enhanced retirement k savings plan benefit 
benefits provided to bargaining unit employees under the retirement plan for bargaining unit employees are not affected by these changes 
net periodic pension costs pension costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and the expected long term return on plan assets see note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
pension costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the market related valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in pension costs 
effective december   the funded status of our pension plans was required to be recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans sfas no 

sfas no 
requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the pension costs relating to certain nw natural pension plans are recovered in utility rates based on sfas no 
 and as such we received regulatory approval from the opuc pursuant to sfas no 
 to record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability  rather than include aoci in common equity  for the funded status of those plans see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term investment returns  plan asset allocations  expected changes in salaries  wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we updated the pension discount rate assumptions from a range of percent to percent to a range of percent to percent 
the new rate assumptions were determined for 
table of contents each plan based on a matching of the estimated cash flow  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments  to the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s or aa or higher by moody s investors service  confirmed the expected rate of future compensation increases between and percent  confirmed the expected long term return on plan assets at percent  and reviewed and updated other key assumptions as needed 
changes in valuation assumptions impact our projected benefit obligations 
the projected benefit obligations at december  decreased million due to an increase in the discount rate assumptions and increased by million due to an increase in the benefit payments for certain retirees 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
the actual annualized returns on plan assets  net of management fees  for the past one year  five year and year periods ended december  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following shows the sensitivity of our pension costs and benefit obligations to future changes in certain actuarial assumptions thousands  except percent change in assumption impact on pension costs impact on benefit obligations at dec 
 discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a the impact of a change in pension costs on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because only between and percent of our pension costs is charged to operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining to percent is capitalized to construction accounts as payroll overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas and fin also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  at the date of adoption and as of december   we did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits as all positions taken are considered highly certain 
our net long term deferred tax liability totaled million at december  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements 
after application of the federal statutory 
table of contents tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our tax returns 
for state income tax and other taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance due to our expectation that all of these assets will be realized 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability for the same amounts see note  income tax expense 
we believe that it is reasonable to expect recovery of these regulatory assets through future customer rates 
however  future regulatory changes could require the write off of all or a portion of these regulatory assets should they no longer be probable of recovery in future rates see regulatory accounting  above  and notes and 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal defense costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to environmental liabilities and related costs we develop estimates based on a review of information available from recently completed studies and negotiations involving several sites 
using sampling data  feasibility studies  existing technology and enacted laws and regulations  we estimated that the total future expenditures for environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation are million as of december  it is our policy to accrue the full amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable liability 
when information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability  or when only the range of probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another  then it is our policy to accrue at the lower end of the range 
accordingly  due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several site investigations  the range of potential loss beyond the amounts currently accrued  and the probabilities thereof  cannot be reasonably estimated 
therefore  we have recorded the liabilities at an amount that reflects the most likely estimate or the low end of the range 

table of contents we will continue to seek recovery of such costs through insurance and through customer rates  and we believe recovery of these costs is probable 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made see note results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates  systems of accounts and issuance of securities by the opuc and the wutc 
in  percent of our utility gas deliveries and percent of our utility operating revenues were derived from oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued customer growth in the residential and commercial markets and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases our most recent general rate increase in oregon authorized rates to customers based on a return on shareholders equity roe of percent and was effective september  we retain all of our earnings up to a threshold level equal to our authorized roe of percent plus basis points  subject to adjustment up or down each year based on movements in long term interest rates 
our most recent general rate case in washington authorized a revenue increase of million per year but did not specifically authorize an roe and was effective july  our plans are to file a general rate case in washington in the current maximum cost based rates for our interstate gas storage services were approved by ferc in these rates are designed to reflect updated costs related to development of the mist gas storage facility from through pursuant to this approval  we were required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study with ferc by january  we requested and received an extension to enable us to file a cost and revenue study based on our actual results 
we expect to file the study by march  oregon rate case moratorium 
in  in connection with the renewal of our conservation tariff and weather normalization rate mechanism  the opuc approved a stipulation that restricts us from filing a general rate case with the opuc prior to september   subject to certain exceptions 
under the agreement  we would be allowed to file a general rate case if an extraordinary event occurs or significant investments are required on behalf of our customers and we are unable to reach agreement regarding alternative forms of cost recovery outside of a general rate case 
these exceptions might include additional investments in our pipeline integrity management program  or expansion of our automated meter reading program if an existing joint meter reading program with a local electric utility ends 
this agreement does not impact our ability to file annual rate adjustments to reflect changes in gas purchase costs under our pga mechanism and to collect  or refund  prior year s gas cost deferrals 

table of contents rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are applied each year under the pga tariff mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases  including contractual arrangements to hedge the purchase price with financial derivatives see comparison of gas distribution operations cost of gas sold  below  interstate pipeline demand charges  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
under the current pga mechanisms  we collect an amount for purchased gas costs based on contract prices and market estimates included in rates 
if the actual purchased gas costs differ from the estimated amounts included in rates  then we are required to defer that difference and pass it on to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
as part of an incentive mechanism in oregon  only percent of the difference is deferred such that the impact on current earnings is either a charge to expense for percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or a credit to expense for percent of the lower cost of gas sold 
in washington  the pga deferral requires percent of all prudently incurred gas costs to be passed through in customer rates 
in october  the opuc and the wutc approved rate decreases effective on november  under our pga mechanism 
the rate reduction lowered average monthly bills of oregon residential customers by percent and those of washington residential customers by percent 
the pga mechanism reflects the january rates approved by ferc for interstate pipeline suppliers 
pursuant to the pga tariffs  approved rate changes effective november  increased average monthly bills of oregon residential sales customers by percent and those of washington residential sales customers by percent 
in  the opuc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and the wutc approved a rate increase averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  both effective october  the opuc is currently conducting a formal review of the pga process used by natural gas utilities in oregon covering gas portfolio requirements  incentive sharing levels and filing requirements  among other items 
the review is expected to be completed in implementation of any changes to the pga mechanism is likely to become effective with the pga filing 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff  which is a rate mechanism designed to adjust margin to compensate the utility for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between earnings and the quantity of energy consumed by customers  removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers conservation efforts 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of utility revenues 
the oregon conservation tariff includes two components a price elasticity adjustment  which adjusts rates annually for expected increases or decreases in customer volumes due to annual changes in commodity costs or periodic changes in our general rates  and a conservation adjustment calculated on a monthly basis to account for the difference between actual and expected volumes also referred to as the decoupling adjustment 
the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account  which 
table of contents is included in the next year s annual pga filing 
baseline consumption was determined by customer consumption data used in the oregon general rate case and is adjusted for current customer growth 
see part ii  item  results of operations comparison of gas distribution operations  below 
in  an independent study to measure the effectiveness of oregon s conservation tariff mechanism recommended continuation of the tariff with minor modifications  which the opuc approved 
in september  the opuc extended our conservation tariff through october weather normalization 
in oregon  the opuc has approved our use of a weather normalization mechanism through october this mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather  decreasing rates when the weather is colder than average and increasing rates when it is warmer than average 
the mechanism is applied to our residential and commercial customers bills between december and may for each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see comparison of gas distribution operations  below 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for our washington customers  which accounts for about percent of our utility revenues 
excess earnings test 
we are subject to an excess earnings test requirement in which we retain all of our earnings up to a threshold level equal to our authorized roe of percent plus basis points 
revenues equivalent to percent of any earnings above the threshold are required to be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year based on movements in long term interest rates 
in and  the threshold after adjustment was percent and percent  respectively 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a result of the or earnings test  and we do not expect that any amounts will be required to be refunded to customers as a result of the earnings test  which will be reviewed by the opuc during the second quarter of the opuc s annual formal review process to test for excess earnings ensures that we are allowed to pass through percent of prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
in washington  we are not subject to an annual excess earnings test  and percent of all prudently incurred gas costs are passed through into customer rates in the annual pga 
industrial tariffs 
in august  the opuc and wutc approved tariff changes to the service options for our major industrial accounts 
the changes set out additional parameters that give us more certainty in the level of gas supplies we will need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the parameters include an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes and a requirement that customers on our annual weighted average cost of gas tariff complete the term of their service election

in july  the opuc approved the accounting treatment and full recovery for the cost of our pipeline integrity management program  a program mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and the related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below 
we classify our costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each months ending september  and recover the 
table of contents costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga 
the accounting and rate treatment for these costs extends through september  and may be reviewed for potential extension after that date 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for pipeline integrity costs incurred in the state of washington 
smart energy program 
effective september   the opuc approved our smart energy program 
smart energy allows residential and commercial customers to offset greenhouse gases produced from their natural gas use 
the smart energy rate is designed to neutralize the impact of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide and methane  by funding projects that prevent  reduce or capture emissions released into the atmosphere 
offset funds collected from customers participating in the program will be forwarded to the climate trust and these funds will specifically target the reduction of methane emissions from farm operations 
regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid during  the oregon legislature passed legislation  effective january   intended to ensure that utilities do not collect in rates more income taxes than they actually pay to taxing authorities 
the opuc adopted permanent rules to implement this legislation in september  which were subsequently amended  with the revised rules approved in september the opuc rules require us to identify the amount of income taxes paid  as well as the amount of taxes authorized to be collected in rates during the tax year 
if amounts paid and amounts collected differ by more than  the opuc is required to direct the utility to implement a rate schedule with an automatic adjustment clause to refund or surcharge for the difference 
for more information regarding this requirement  see comparison of gas distribution operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
in january  the internal revenue service irs ruled on our request for a private letter ruling on the issue of whether this state law complies with the provisions of federal tax law  including the normalization requirements of the internal revenue code 
the irs ruling indicated that  as presented to them  the oregon law does not violate the normalization requirements of federal tax law

amounts reported as margin for each category of customers is net of demand charges and revenue taxes 
average weather represents the year average degree days  as determined in our last oregon general rate case 
our utility margin results are affected by customer growth and to a certain extent by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff that contributes to changes in margin based on changes in residential and commercial customer consumption  and we have a weather normalization mechanism that adjusts customer bills up or down contributing to changes in margin based on above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory developments rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
compared to total utility margin increased million or percent in compared to with residential and commercial customers contributing an additional million to margin in  not including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
the million decrease in margin from industrial customers in was partially offset by a decrease in revenue adjustments from regulatory deferrals and amortizations and miscellaneous fees 
the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms decreased margin by a net million in compared to  primarily reflecting colder weather  partially offset by an increase in decoupling that reflects higher than expected consumption 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in were about the same as last year 
an increase in regulatory sharing of gas cost savings of million and a regulatory adjustment related to income taxes paid of million also contributed to the increase in margin see regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  and cost of gas sold  below 
volume increases in were due mainly to residential and commercial customer growth  which reflects a net increase of  customers during  or an annual growth rate of percent 
our growth rate has slowed but remains well above the national average for local gas distribution companies 
recent economic conditions have slowed the level of new construction in our service territory 
our weather normalization mechanism reduced margin by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to an increase of million in added margin for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
the weather normalization mechanism is designed to balance our margins when weather deviates from average 
the decoupling mechanism increased margin by million in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a margin decrease of million in decoupling is designed to adjust to our margin to reflect changes in customer usage due to customer conservation efforts 
compared to total utility margin increased million or percent in compared to with residential and commercial customers contributing an additional million to margin in  
table of contents including the effect of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
the million increase in margin from industrial customers in was offset by a decrease in revenue adjustments from regulatory deferrals and amortizations and miscellaneous fees 
the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms decreased margin by a net million in compared to  primarily reflecting lower than expected consumption decline due to customer conservation efforts 
our customer base grew in  with a net increase of  customers 
the growth rate for was percent  compared to percent in the slower growth rate in was primarily due to a smaller increase in residential customers reflecting a modest slowdown in new construction 
in  weather was percent warmer than in the weather normalization mechanism added million to margin for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average  and reduced margin by million in based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
generally  we would have expected the weather normalization mechanism in to recover lost margin when temperatures were warmer than average  but that year we lost heating volumes and corresponding margin revenues in the latter part of may when temperatures were significantly warmer than average because those volume and margin losses were not entirely covered by the weather normalization mechanism  which ends on may each year 
the decoupling mechanism decreased margin by million in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a contribution of million in residential and commercial sales residential and commercial sales markets are impacted by seasonal weather patterns  energy prices  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service areas 
typically  percent or more of our annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced due to our weather normalization mechanism in oregon where about percent of our customers are served 
beginning in  this mechanism became effective for the period from december through may of each heating season 
approximately percent of our eligible oregon customers have opted out of the mechanism 
in oregon  we also have a conservation decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between our earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by our customers  so that we do not have an incentive to discourage customers from conserving energy 
in washington  where the remaining percent of our customers are served  we do not have a weather normalization or a conservation decoupling mechanism 
as a result  these mechanisms do not fully insulate the utility from earnings volatility due to weather and conservation 
see the above tables under comparison of gas distribution operations for the adjustments to utility margin revenues from the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
the primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are seasonal weather patterns  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service territory 
compared to operating revenues increased percent  primarily due to a percent increase in volumes  volumes were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent customer growth and percent colder weather  and 
table of contents margin before regulatory adjustments for weather normalization  decoupling and income taxes paid was percent higher  reflecting increased volumes from customer growth and higher gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see cost of gas sold  below 
compared to volumes sold were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent customer growth in the residential and commercial sector and improved economic conditions  partially offset by percent warmer weather  operating revenues were percent higher  primarily due to a percent increase in volumes and an percent increase in the average rate per therm due to recent pga rate increases  effective october  and november   and margin was percent higher  reflecting customer growth and higher gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see cost of gas sold  below 
industrial sales and transportation the primary factors that impact results of operations in the industrial sales and transportation markets are commodity costs  competition and economic conditions in our service territory 
compared to operating revenue decreased million  or percent  due to customers transferring from sales service to transportation service where cost of gas is not a component in operating revenues  volumes delivered to industrial customers decreased million therms  or less than percent  reflecting a reduction in sales volumes of million therms offset by an increase in transportation volumes of million therms  and margin decreased percent  reflecting higher volumes under lower margin special contracts 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  or percent  with the increase primarily in lower margin interruptible schedules  operating revenue decreased million  or percent  due to customers transferring from sales service to transportation service where cost of gas is not a component in operating revenues  and margin increased percent  reflecting increased volumes 
several large industrial customers transferred from sales service back to transportation service in high natural gas prices result  from time to time  in a number of our large industrial customers switching from transportation service  where they arrange for their own supplies through independent third parties  to sales service where we sell them the gas commodity under regulatory tariffs 
in such cases  our tariff requires us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred to serve those customers 

table of contents regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid based upon the revised rules issued by the opuc in september  we filed our tax report for the tax year on october  for the tax year  we estimated the utility was entitled to recover million through a surcharge to our oregon utility customers based on taxes paid that were greater than taxes collected  which was primarily driven by gains from gas cost savings from the pga incentive sharing mechanism in the increase in oregon revenues for this surcharge is expected to go into effect june  and would be recovered in a one time adjustment to customers 
for the tax year  we estimate the utility will again be entitled to a surcharge for taxes paid in excess of taxes collected in rates  largely driven by gains from gas cost savings from the pga incentive sharing mechanism in for  we recognized an estimated surcharge of million 
the combined and surcharge estimate of million was recognized in and is included in gross operating revenues 
deferred income tax expense of million was also recognized in related to the and estimated surcharges  resulting in a net contribution to earnings of million see regulatory matters regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  above 
other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts other than deferrals relating to gas costs 
other revenues increased net operating revenues by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues in were million higher than in primarily due to a million increase in deferrals under the decoupling mechanism see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above  a million decrease in amortization expense related to the decoupling deferrals from prior periods  a million increase in interstate gas storage credits to customers reflecting higher regulatory sharing of net income from storage operations and a decrease of million in amortization expense related to demand side management deferrals 
compared to other revenues in were million lower than in primarily due to a million decrease in deferrals under the decoupling mechanism see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above and a million increase in amortization of the decoupling deferrals from prior periods  partially offset by an increase of million in interstate gas storage credits to customers reflecting increased net income from storage operations  a decrease of million in amortization expense for the south mist pipeline extension and a decrease of million in the deferral for the oregon income tax kicker refund 
cost of gas sold natural gas commodity prices had risen significantly in recent years  but the cost of gas decreased slightly in the effects of higher commodity prices and price volatility on core utility customers are mitigated  in part  through our use of underground storage facilities  fixed price commodity hedge contracts and short term sales of excess gas supply and transportation capacity to off system customers in periods when core utility customers do not require the full amount of contract gas supplies or firm pipeline capacity 

table of contents the total cost of gas sold was million in  a decrease of million or percent compared to  and cost of gas sold in was million  an increase of million or percent higher than the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  pipeline demand charges  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
under the pga tariff in oregon  our net income is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
in each of the last three years  our actual gas costs were lower than the gas costs embedded in rates  with the effect being that our share of the cost savings increased margin by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we use natural gas derivatives  primarily fixed price commodity swaps  under the terms of our financial derivatives policy  to help manage our exposure to floating price gas purchase contracts see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  above  and note 
we realized net losses of million and million from our financial hedges in and  respectively  compared to a gain of million in gains and losses from the financial hedging of utility gas purchases generally are included in cost of gas  but generally do not impact net income because the hedges are factored into our pga deferrals and annual rate changes 
to the extent that any utility gas hedge is entered into after the annual pga filing  then the gains and losses are subject to our pga incentive sharing mechanism with percent deferred and percent recorded to current income 
business segments other than local gas distribution gas storage we earned million in net income from our non utility gas storage business segment in  after regulatory sharing and income taxes  equivalent to cents a share  compared to million or cents a share in and million or cents a share in see note 
earnings from this business segment were higher in primarily because of increased revenues from additional contract storage and higher margins from our contract with an independent energy marketing company that optimizes the value of our utility assets 
in oregon  we retain percent of the pre tax income from gas storage as well as from third party optimization revenues when the costs of the capacity used have not been included in utility rates  or percent of the pre tax income from such storage and optimization when the capacity costs have been included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for crediting to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from storage services and third party optimization 
other the other business segment primarily consists of a wholly owned subsidiary  financial corporation  as well as various other non utility investments  including an investment in an aircraft that is leased to a us airline  our equity investment in a proposed natural gas transmission pipeline project palomar pipeline  and our wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch see note 
our net investment

the decrease primarily reflects the sale in october of investments in alternative energy projects for million plus our portion of the investments retained cash  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
our net investment balance in the aircraft lease at december  and was million and million  respectively  with the decrease primarily due to the receipt in march of the final payment due under the terms of the original year lease agreement 
our equity investment balance in the proposed natural gas pipeline project with gtn was million at december  and a negligible amount at december  see strategic opportunities pipeline diversity  above 
net income from our other business segment was million for each of  and in  we recognized net income of million from financial corporation  primarily related to the sale of limited partnership interests in two wind power electric generation projects in california 
these sales generated an after tax gain of million 
this was offset in part by the net loss we recognized related to the gill ranch investment of million 
subsidiaries financial corporation operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the increase is primarily due to the gain from the sale of financial corporation s limited partnership interests in two wind power electric generation projects in california in october gill ranch in september  we announced a joint project with pg e to develop a new underground natural gas storage facility at gill ranch near fresno  california 
we formed gill ranch as a subsidiary of nw natural

operating expenses operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased by million in  or percent  compared to which in part reflects certain strategic initiatives which increased operations and maintenance expense 
these initiatives included additional training expenses million  promotional and safety campaigns million and maintenance projects million 
absent these strategic initiatives  operations and maintenance would have increased percent 
operations and maintenance expense increased million in  or percent  compared to the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to a million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense  primarily due to bonuses related to improved financial and operating results on annual and long term incentive plan performance goals  a million increase in costs for maintenance projects and geo hazard repairs  
table of contents a million increase in training  maintenance and telecommunication expenses related to the implementation of the first phase of a new integrated information system  and a million increase in start up expenses for the smart energy program 
partially offsetting the above increases was a million decrease in severance expenses 
compared to a million increase in payroll expense  primarily due to bonuses related to improved results on annual and long term incentive plan performance goals  a million increase in severance expenses related to the severance incentive plan  and a million increase in stock option expense due to the required adoption of sfas no 
r related to stock based compensation expense 
partially offsetting the above increases were a million decrease in system damages and damage claims written off  and a million reduction in charges related to a settlement with a group of industrial customers in general taxes general taxes  which are principally comprised of property and payroll taxes  increased million  or percent  in compared to  and increased million  or percent  in compared to the major factors that contributed to changes in general taxes are compared to a million increase in property taxes related to a percent increase in net utility plant  a million increase in regulatory fees based on higher gross operating revenue  and a million increase in other taxes due to an increase in the annual fee to the oregon department of energy

in  we completed a depreciation study on all company plant and property  which generally indicates that depreciation rates overall would be reduced if we maintain the existing average service life depreciation method 
we applied for the adoption of new depreciation rates using the average service life method 
however  if the opuc or wutc were to require us to adopt a different depreciation method such as the equal life group method  then depreciation rates could increase 
utility depreciation rates and methods are subject to review and approval by the opuc and wutc  and new rates will not be placed into service until depreciation rate proceedings are approved 
we submitted the updated depreciation study for regulatory approval in and will implement the new rates upon approval 
we do not anticipate that adoption of these new rates will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

these negative changes were partially offset by an increase in earnings from equity investments of financial corporation of million  reflecting the gain on sale on its limited partnership interests in two wind power electric generation projects  and an increase of million in net interest charges on deferred regulatory accounts  reflecting lower net credit balances outstanding in these accounts 
other income and expense net improved by million in over the increase was primarily due to higher gains of million from company owned life insurance  reflecting higher policy benefits realized during  and a net decrease of million in other non operating expenses  reflecting cost reduction initiatives 
these positive changes were partially offset by a million increase in net interest charges on deferred regulatory accounts  reflecting higher net credit balances outstanding in these accounts

when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to fund long term debt redemption requirements and short term commercial paper maturities see liquidity and capital resources  below  and notes  and 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows december  common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of commercial paper notes  which are supported by committed lines of credit 
we have available a committed bank facility totaling million through may  see credit agreement  below  and note 
short term debt balances typically are reduced toward the end of the winter heating season as a significant amount of our current assets  primarily accounts receivable and gas inventories  are converted into cash 
capital expenditures primarily relate to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements see cash flows investing activities  below 
certain contractual commitments under capital leases  operating leases  gas supply purchase contracts and other contracts require an adequate source of funding 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
to provide long term financing  we periodically issue and sell secured or unsecured debt  preferred stock or common stock 
in june and december  we issued million and million of secured medium term notes  respectively 
at december   we had million available for future issuance of debt or equity securities under a universal shelf registration  which was approved by the opuc see financing activities  below 
on january   we filed a new universal shelf registration for an unspecified amount of securities to replace the existing universal shelf registration 
under new rules  nw natural may designate the amount of securities to be registered at the time of issuance 

table of contents neither our mortgage and deed of trust nor the indenture under which other long term debt may be issued contain credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for agreements with certain counterparties under our financial derivatives policy  which may require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letters of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade  or in some cases if the mark to market value exceeds a certain threshold 
based on the availability of short term credit facilities and our expectation of being able to issue long term debt and equity securities  we believe there is sufficient liquidity to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements  including the contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 
dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock in each year since the stock first was issued to the public in annual common dividend payments per share  adjusted for stock splits  have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
it is the intention of the board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on common stock on a quarterly basis

in december  the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety now the pipeline hazardous materials safety administration issued a rule that specifies the detailed requirements for transmission pipeline integrity management plans as mandated by the pipeline safety act 
see part i  item  pipeline safety 
we continued to achieve our milestones  completing the required inspection of the top percent highest risk transmission pipelines in we are currently on track to meet the next milestone to complete the inspection of all transmission pipelines in hcas by december financing activities cash used in financing activities in totaled million  as compared to million in factors contributing to the million net increase in cash used include an increase in share repurchases of million  an increase in long term debt retired of million  and a reduction in long term debt issuances of million  offset by an increase in cash from the change in short term debt balances of million in compared to cash used in financing activities in totaled million  as compared to cash provided by financing in of million 
factors contributing to the million net change were the net change in short term debt of million  million less of long term debt issued during and million less equity financing in  partially offset by million less redemptions of long term debt in compared to in october  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional principal amount of million 
this fixed rate forward starting swap is intended to mitigate a substantial portion of the interest rate exposure associated with our anticipated issuance of mtns during the second half of when we would expect to cash settle this contract 
the associated gain or loss on settlement will be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability and amortized in accordance with regulatory requirements 
we did not issue any new long term debt during in december  we sold million of series b  secured mtns due and used the proceeds to reduce short term indebtedness and to fund utility construction 
in  we sold million of series b  secured mtns due and million of series b  secured mtns due  and used the proceeds to redeem long term debt  to reduce short term indebtedness and to make investments in utility plant 
in  we announced a program to repurchase up to million shares  or up to million in value  of our common stock through a repurchase program 
in that program was modified to million shares and million in value  and the program was further increased in to million shares and million and extended through may the purchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions

pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans we make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarial assumptions and estimates  tax regulations and funding requirements under federal law 
generally  it is our policy to contribute at least the minimum amount required by internal revenue code regulations and the employee retirement income security act of it is also our intent to contribute additional amounts sufficient on a sound actuarial basis to maintain funding targets and provide for the payment of future benefits under the plans 
our qualified defined pension plans are currently funded at nearly percent of the projected benefit obligation at december  for more information see note ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and  our ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges  and fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  weather risk and interest rate risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into spot  short term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated pipeline transportation contracts 
historically  we have taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in our natural gas supply contracts 
these contracts are primarily index based and subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
our pga mechanisms in oregon and washington provide for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  we absorb percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retain percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
market risks related to potential adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates or counterparty credit quality in relation to these financial and physical contracts are discussed below 
commodity price risk natural gas commodity prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price swap  put and call option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing  subject to a prudency review 
at december  and  notional amounts under these commodity swap  put and call option contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
if the related financial derivative contracts had been settled on december   a regulatory loss of million would have been realized and deferred see note 
the million unrealized loss is an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to be paid as follows million in and million by october  the amount realized will change based on market prices at the time contracts settle 
we monitor the liquidity of our financial derivative contracts and  based on the existing open interest in the contracts held  we believe existing contracts to be liquid 
all of our commodity financial hedge contracts settle by october  interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is primarily managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  options and other hedge products  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge the interest rate on our next long term debt issuance  which is expected to occur in the latter part of 
table of contents this swap is with an aa aaa rated counterparty and qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate maturities by million in each of and see note and note 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to the purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   no foreign currency forward contracts extended beyond december  if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a gain of million would have been realized see note 
credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers 
we evaluate and continuously monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds  in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
periodically we may have credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties based on the estimated fair value of derivative contracts outstanding 
at december   in aggregate our financial derivative counterparties owed us million while we owed our counterparties a net million 
our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have a specified minimum credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and the policy sets forth limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 

table of contents the following table summarizes our credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of s p or moody s rating  or a middle rating if the entity is split rated more than one rating level financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands dec

 aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total to mitigate the credit risk of financial derivatives we have master netting arrangements with our counterparties that provide for making or receiving net cash settlements 
generally  transactions of the same type in the same currency that have a settlement on the same day with a single counterparty are netted and a single payment is delivered or received depending on which party is due funds 
additionally we have master contracts in place with each of our derivative counterparties that include provisions for posting or calling for collateral 
generally we can obtain cash or marketable securities as collateral with one day s notice 
we utilize various collateral management strategies to reduce liquidity risk 
the collateral provisions vary by counterparty but are not expected to result in any significant posting of collateral  if any 
we have performed stress tests on the portfolio and concluded that the liquidity risk from collateral calls is not material 
during  we neither called for nor posted collateral with any of our derivative counterparties 
our derivative credit exposure is primarily with investment grade banks rated aa aa or higher 
contracts are diversified across counterparties to reduce credit and liquidity risk 
credit exposure to customers 
in the short term  market prices for natural gas have moderated and resulted in some of our large industrial customers changing from sales services to transportation service 
under sales service  the customer purchases both its gas commodity supply and transportation service from us 
under transportation service  the customer purchases its commodity supplies from an independent third party  while we provide the transportation service for delivery of that gas to the customer s premise 
as a result of this migration from sales service to transportation service  our credit exposure to large industrial customers is expected to moderate 
we monitor and manage the credit exposure of our industrial customers through credit policies and procedures  which are designed to reduce credit risk 
these policies and procedures include an ongoing review of credit risks  including changes in the services provided to industrial customers as well as changes in market conditions and customers credit quality 
changes in credit risk may require us to obtain additional assurance  such as deposits  letters of credit  guarantees and prepayments  to reduce our credit exposure 
we also monitor and manage the credit exposure of our residential and commercial customers 
this credit risk is largely mitigated by the nature of our regulated business and reasonably short collection terms  as well as by the consistent application of our credit policies and procedures 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of 
table of contents average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   about percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers
