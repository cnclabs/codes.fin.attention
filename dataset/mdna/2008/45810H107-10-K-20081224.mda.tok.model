several large and small aerospace defense contractors have developed satellite control systems either in house as primary contractors or through subcontractors 
as a result  some of our competitors are also current or potential customers 
our primary competitors include the following lockheed martin corporation northrop grumman corporation general dynamics corporation thales alenia space eads astrium raytheon company gmv space systems  inc harris corporation l communications holdings  inc space systems loral orbital sciences corporation viasat  inc systems engineering management company semco many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we have 
some of these competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of large  diversified companies that have access to the financial resources of their parent companies 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects 
in addition  several smaller companies have specialized capabilities that compete with the capabilities we offer through our products and services 
our products also face competition from certain off the shelf products developed by the us government for satellite command and control 
we cannot predict how our competitive position may be affected by changing economic or competitive conditions  customer requirements  or technological developments 
we principally obtain contracts and subcontracts through competitive procurements offered by the us government or commercial enterprises 
backlog and seasonality our estimated backlog is as follows in millions september  september  september  outstanding commitments general commitments total 
table of contents outstanding commitments consist of contracts where we have a firm commitment by the customer to provide specific products and or services  frequently over an extended period of time 
the increase in outstanding commitments backlog in fiscal relates primarily to major bookings including the gps ocx phase a award  several ccs c programs and several raidrs contract modifications in our government systems segment  the protostar and white sands programs in our commercial systems segment and the lockheed martin hardware recap and icads programs in our space communications systems segment 
general commitments consist of contracts that have been awarded to us where our customer has certain contract options that management believes are likely to be exercised in the future 
contract options are our contractual agreement to provide future products or services in the event that the customer exercises those future options 
the decrease in general commitments backlog in fiscal relates primarily to work progressing on some of our large projects in our government systems segment  which have anticipated funding increases in fiscal and future fiscal years 
many of our contracts are multi year contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of our contract backlog 
our total contract backlog represents management s estimate of the aggregate unearned revenues expected to be earned by us over the life of all of our contracts  including option periods 
because many factors affect the scheduling of projects  we cannot predict when revenues will be realized on projects included in our backlog 
in addition  although contract backlog represents only business where we have written agreements with our customers  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
accordingly  we believe that backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
our business is cyclical  but it is not seasonal to any significant extent 
our backlog typically is subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded 
raw materials we require the use of various raw materials  including racks  chassis  servers  single board computers  printed wiring boards  and cables in our assembly processes 
these raw materials are used primarily in our space communications systems segment 
we purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers 
at times  we concentrate orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships and receive quantity discounts 
raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 
we have several cooperation agreements with a french supplier for certain modem systems that we further customize and deliver to our customers 
these agreements are subject to termination by either party at any time 
to date  the relationship with the supplier is very good 
the agreements provide for the support of delivered product in the event of agreement termination 
however  an unanticipated termination of the cooperation agreements could be disruptive to our generation of revenues as we would be unable to bid on additional work that depends on these modems 
proprietary rights we regard our products as proprietary trade secrets and confidential information 
we rely on a combination of common law copyright and trade secret laws  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other industry standard methods for protecting ownership of our proprietary software  hardware  and systems 
therefore  none of our software  hardware  or systems are patented 
in spite of these precautions  however  an unauthorized third party could obtain and use information that we consider proprietary 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
during  we reviewed our intellectual property inventory and commenced a process to evaluate a potential intellectual property and trademark filings in the future 
we do not have confidentiality agreements with all of our employees 
we believe that we have all necessary rights to market our products  although it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims in the future 

table of contents employees as of september   we had approximately full time employees 
competition for highly skilled employees is intense 
we believe that our employees and their knowledge and capabilities are a major asset and we have been successful in attracting and retaining skilled employees in our core business areas 
we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements

risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  careful consideration of the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  or future results  is recommended 
any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government 
the following table lists the approximate revenues  as a percentage of our total revenues  derived from contracts funded by the us government and by one particular agency of the us government  the department of the air force  for fiscal years   and time period percentage of revenues derived from contracts and subcontracts funded by the us government percentage of revenues derived from contracts and subcontracts funded by the department of the air force fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year we expect that us government business  primarily derived from department of the air force contracts and subcontracts  is likely to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by changing us government procurement practices and policies as well as declines in us government civilian and defense agency spending 
the factors that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to win new contracts with the us government  or retain existing contracts  include the following budgetary constraints  changes in us government funding levels  programs  policies  or requirements  
table of contents technological developments  changes in level of us government funds available for services that we provide  the adoption of new laws or regulations  and global economic conditions 
some of our us government contracts individually contribute a significant percentage of our revenues 
our single largest contract with the department of the air force represents approximately of our revenues for fiscal year and a small number of other large us government contracts are likely to continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues in the future 
termination of any of these contracts or our inability to renew or replace these contracts when they expire for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our contracts and subcontracts that are funded by the us government are subject to termination without cause by the us government 
all of our contracts and subcontracts that are funded by the us government are subject to termination by the us government for convenience  which means termination without cause 
should the us government terminate a contract without cause  we would be reimbursed for allowable costs incurred through the date of termination and would be paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profits or fees attributable to work actually performed 
termination of any of our significant us government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our contracts and subcontracts that are funded by the us government are subject to us government regulations and audits  which include the acceptance of our reimbursable rates relating to overhead and selling  general and administrative expenses 
us government contracts require compliance with various contract provisions and procurement regulations 
the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations or increase the costs of competing for or performing us government contracts 
any violation of these regulations by us could result in the termination of the contracts  imposition of fines  or exclusion from us government contracting and us government approved subcontracting for some specific time period 
in addition  our contract costs and revenues are subject to adjustment as a result of audits by the dcaa and other us government auditors 
we reflect any adjustments required by us government auditors in our financial statements 
although we have thus far not been required to make any material audit adjustments  it is possible that adjustments will be required in the future 
in addition  we are required to self report to the us government any overpayments on our us government contracts  and to inform the appropriate federal agency inspector general whenever we have credible evidence of a violation of certain federal criminal laws or the civil false claims act in connection with our us government contracts and subcontracts 
any such disclosures by us could subject us to a formal investigation  fines and civil or criminal prosecution  which could require significant management attention and legal resources and could have a material adverse effect on us 
the knowing failure to timely disclose to the us government credible evidence of a violation of certain federal criminal laws or the civil false claims act in connection with our us government contracts and subcontracts  or a significant overpayment on one of our contracts  could result in our exclusion from us government contracting and us government approved subcontracting for some specific period 
our contracts and subcontracts are generally subject to a competitive bidding process that may affect our ability to win contract awards or renewals in the future 
our contracts generally are awarded to us through a formal competitive process in which we may have many competitors 
upon expiration  these contracts may be subject  once again  to a competitive renewal 
table of contents process if applicable 
we may not be successful in winning contract awards or renewals in the future 
our failure to renew or replace existing contracts when they expire could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our contracts and subcontracts with us government agencies are subject to competition and awarded on the basis of technical merit  personnel qualifications  experience  and price 
our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially affected to the extent that us government agencies believe our competitors offer a more attractive combination of the foregoing factors 
in addition  new us government contract awards are subject to protest by competitors at the time of award that can result in the re opening of the competition or evaluation process  the award of the subject contract to a competitor  or the reopening of the sealed bidding process 
we consider bid protests to be a customary element in the process of procuring us government contracts 
our contracts and subcontracts that are funded by the us government are subject to the budget and funding process of the us government 
many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years but are funded only on an annual basis 
accordingly  our contracts and subcontracts are subject to termination  reduction  or modification in the event of changes in the us government s requirements funding priorities or budgetary constraints 
budget decisions by the us government may have long term consequences for our size and structure and that of the defense industry 
if one or more of our programs is reduced  extended  or terminated  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional funding and are typically subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding 
congress usually allocates funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take several years 
at the onset of a major program  the contract is usually incrementally funded  and additional funds are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency as funds are made available by congress for future fiscal years 
contractors often experience revenue uncertainties during the first quarter of the us government s fiscal year  which begins october  until differences between budget requests and appropriations are resolved 
to date  congress has funded all years of the multi year major program contracts for which we have served as prime contractor or subcontractor  but this may not continue in the future 
we enter into fixed price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from the sale of services and products to commercial and government customers 
many of our contracts are for a fixed price and can subject us to substantial risks relating to unexpected cost increases and other factors outside of our control 
our revenues on fixed price contracts are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis and we calculate an estimate of completion to determine revenue for each fixed price project 
as a result  contract price and cost estimates on fixed price contracts are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in income in the period when the estimates are revised 
we may fail to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately  or control costs during performance on a fixed price contract 
any of these failures may reduce our profit or cause a loss under our commercial contracts 
our commercial contracts are subject to competition  strict performance obligations and other requirements 
under the terms of our commercial contracts  we typically must agree to meet strict performance obligations and project milestones  which we may not be able to satisfy 
our failure to meet these 
table of contents performance obligations and milestones permits the other party to terminate the contract and  under certain circumstances  recover liquidated damages or other penalties from us  any of which events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
intense competition in the satellite ground systems industry could harm our financial performance 
the satellite ground system industry is very competitive and marked by continuous technological challenges 
several large aerospace defense contractors have developed satellite control systems either in house as primary contractors or through subcontractors 
as a result  some of our competitors are also current or potential customers 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we have 
some of these competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of large  diversified companies that have access to the financial resources of their parent companies 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other contracts 
in addition  several smaller companies have specialized capabilities that compete with the capabilities we offer through our products and services 
our products also face competition from certain off the shelf products developed by the us government for satellite command and control 
we cannot predict how our competitive position may be affected by changing economic or competitive conditions  customer requirements  or technological developments 
we principally obtain contracts and subcontracts through competitive procurements offered by the us government or commercial enterprises 
we may not be able to compete successfully 
the new federal administration may reduce aerospace and defense spending  which could adversely affect our business 
in january  a new federal administration will take office  and it is widely expected that the new federal administration may reduce defense spending 
if defense spending is reduced  it may affect our contracts or our ability to win additional defense contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with our growth strategy and acquiring other companies 
we may continue to look for complementary businesses to acquire so that we can strengthen and expand our core business  however  we may not be able to find any attractive candidates or favorable acquisition terms proposed by potential acquisition candidates 
we may compete with other companies for these acquisition candidates  which may make an acquisition more expensive for us 
instability in the us securities markets and volatility in our stock price may make acquisitions with our stock more expensive 
if we seek to fund acquisitions with borrowed funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on favorable terms or at all  particularly in light of the current difficulties in the credit markets 
if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable candidates  we may not be able to expand beyond the growth that we have experienced in the past several fiscal years 
accordingly  our acquisition strategy may not improve  and could possibly weaken  our overall business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be exposed to product liability or related claims with respect to our products 
our products are mission critical parts of sophisticated and extremely expensive satellite and range safety systems 
should a satellite mission fail  should the system s service become unavailable due to a failure or malfunction in the ground system  or should a space launch vehicle be destroyed as a result of malfunction  we could be sued for product liability or related claims 
moreover  we have found obtaining insurance to cover product liability claims to be impractical and not cost effective 
any product liability or related claim could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents our products may become obsolete due to rapid technological change in the satellite industry 
any of our products could become obsolete at any time due to rapid technological changes in the satellite industry 
in addition  we may not be able to update our products quickly enough to remain competitive 
the rapid pace of technological change in our industry exposes us to risk of loss due to the development of superior technologies by our competitors 
we are also dependent upon technologies developed by third parties for integrating our ground systems with a variety of satellite systems 
to the extent that we cannot obtain necessary technologies from third parties  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  as land based telecommunications services expand  demand for certain types of satellite based services  such as the services we provide  may be reduced 
new technology used by our competitors could render satellite based services less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in alternative ways or through the use of telecommunications standards that are incompatible with our products 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to introduce innovative products and services on a cost effective and timely basis 
our business is subject to risks associated with international transactions 
for fiscal year  approximately of our revenue was derived from our international operations 
conducting business in countries outside the united states carries additional managerial  operational  legal  and political risks 
these operations are vulnerable to changes in government regulations and telecommunications standards  tariffs or taxes  and other trade barriers 
our agreements relating to foreign operations may be enforceable only in foreign jurisdictions  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our rights 
we currently have several contracts that are subject to currency fluctuations in foreign markets 
the value of these contracts is not material 
to mitigate currency fluctuation  we may periodically use foreign currency exchange contracts 
if we enter into these types of contracts in the future  the limited availability of us currency in certain local markets could prevent a contracting party from making payments to us in us dollars or exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our revenues 
we may not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate currency fluctuation in the future or  even if we do enter into such hedging transactions  they may not protect us from currency fluctuations 
various agencies and departments of the us government regulate our ability to pursue business opportunities outside the united states 
exports of space related products  services  and technical information require licenses granted by the us government and are subject to international traffic in arms regulations itar 
we do not currently have blanket authorization for export of our products and services and may not be able to obtain such authorization in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or approvals on a per transaction basis  and our inability to do so  or our failure to comply with the terms of the authorization when granted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials that we buy from suppliers 
through our rt logic and lumistar subsidiaries  we have several cooperation agreements with a french supplier for certain modem systems that we further customize and deliver to our customers 
these agreements are subject to termination by either party 
the agreements provide for the support of delivered product in the event of agreement termination 
however  our business could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our supplier such as the destruction of our suppliers facilities or their distribution infrastructure  a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers employees  or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality  or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers 
because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts  our business could be adversely affected if we were unable 
table of contents to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms  and an unanticipated termination of the cooperation agreements could be disruptive to revenue attainment as we would be unable to bid on additional work that depends on these modems 
we depend upon attracting and retaining a highly skilled professional staff 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to attract  retain  train  and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly in the area of information technology 
we face significant competition for employees with the computer and technology skills required to perform our services and create our products 
in addition  we must often comply with provisions in us government contracts that require specified levels of education  work experience  and security clearances for our employees 
we may not be successful in attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled and qualified employees in the future 
for all of these reasons  the loss of our key technical personnel  or our inability in the future to attract key employees or to relocate them as required by customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we depend on the services of our key personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree on our key management personnel  especially the following john b 
higginbotham  chief executive officer and president william m 
bambarger  jr  chief financial officer and treasurer stuart c 
daughtridge  executive vice president  space communications systems division james g 
schuetzle  executive vice president  government division james b 
kramer  senior vice president  commercial division jeffrey a 
rosolio  executive vice president  human resources and administration and secretary we have employment agreements with all of these individuals  except for james b 
kramer 
the loss of any one of these key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any members of management 
we depend upon intellectual property rights and risk having our rights infringed 
much of our business is derived from work product  software programs  designs  algorithms  methodologies  and other information that we have privately developed 
we have historically not sought patent protection for our software  hardware  and systems 
although we seek to protect our intellectual property with a combination of common law and registered trademarks and copyrights  and software license and confidentiality agreements with third parties  these measures may not prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge  practices  or procedures 
there is also no guarantee that others may not independently develop similar knowledge  practices  or procedures 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
moreover  we do not have confidentiality agreements with all of our employees 
disclosure or loss of control over our privately developed information could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we may also be subject to litigation to defend against infringement claims 
any litigation with respect to our intellectual property rights would be costly and could divert management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
adverse determinations in litigation involving our intellectual property could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights  subject us to significant liabilities  
table of contents require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from selling our services or products 
any one of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
under some us government contracts  we may develop software that in the future we may decide to commercialize 
in order to commercialize that software  we might need to invest additional r d funds to re market the software as a commercial product 
if the product was developed using any government funding  government regulations and contract provisions may prevent us from selling the resulting product to any government agencies 
if the primary market for a potential product is government agencies  we may not be able to recover the invested funds through our sales of the product 
in addition  the government may acquire certain rights to software programs we develop that are funded under government contracts or subcontracts and may disclose information with respect to those programs or products to third parties  including our competitors 
the estimated backlog under our us government contracts is not necessarily indicative of revenues that will actually be realized under those contracts 
many of our us government contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of our contract backlog 
backlog means the total value of all contracts less the revenues earned to date on those contracts 
the estimated backlog under a us government contract is not necessarily indicative of revenues that will actually be realized under that contract 
congress normally appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis  even though actual contract performance may take many years 
as a result  contracts ordinarily are only partially funded at the time of award  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the contracting agency as congress makes appropriations in subsequent fiscal years 
it is possible that congress will not appropriate funds or that procuring agencies will not commit funds to our us government contracts for their anticipated terms 
in addition  most of our us government contracts have an initial term of one year plus a number of option years 
the us government may not extend a particular contract through its option years 
certain of our large contracts provide that we will not receive payment until the services under those contracts are requested and performed 
cancellations or adjustments in the terms of these contracts could occur 
in addition  our services under these contracts may not be requested at currently anticipated levels in the future 
performance of some of our us government contracts may require security clearances 
certain of our contracts with us government agencies require that some of our employees and procedures meet security clearance requirements 
if problems develop meeting security clearance requirements  those problems could materially limit our ability to perform these contracts 
some of our contracts are subject to security classification restrictions 
we derive some of our revenues and profits from programs that are subject to security classification restrictions restricted business  which could limit our ability to discuss details about these programs  their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs 
as a result  investors might have less insight into our restricted business than our other businesses or could experience less ability to evaluate fully the risks  disputes or claims associated with restricted business 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of securities of technology companies has historically faced significant volatility 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
many factors that have influenced trading prices will vary from period to period  including actual or anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry  changes in our earnings and revenues or quarterly operating results  announcements by competitors  announcements  if any  with respect to our exploration of strategic alternatives  regulatory actions  and general economic conditions 
adverse developments with respect to any of these events could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on factors that include the following the number  size  and scope of our contracts  equipment purchases and other expenditures required for our business  bid and proposal efforts undertaken  delays  employee productivity  adequacy of provisions for losses  accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing contracts  and general economic conditions demand for our products and services in each of the markets we serve can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to revisions in customer budgets or schedules and other factors beyond our control 
due to all of the foregoing factors  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in a particular period 
in this event  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions  and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired  requiring substantial write downs that would reduce our operating income 
goodwill accounts for approximately million  or  of our recorded total assets as of september  we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment 
principally  a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill 
if our goodwill were to become significantly impaired  this would require substantial write downs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the disruption  expense  and potential liability associated with existing and future litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we may be subject to various legal proceedings and threatened legal proceedings from time to time 
any litigation  regardless of its merits  could significantly divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees being borne by us 
further  actions that have been or will be brought against us may be resolved in our favor or  if significant monetary judgments are rendered against us  we may not have the ability to pay such judgments 
such disruptions  legal fees  and any losses resulting from these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we are currently subject to a formal investigation by the sec and a related inquiry by nasdaq  which could require significant management attention and legal resources and could have a material adverse effect on us 
as previously disclosed  the sec has issued a formal order of investigation  and nasdaq has initiated a related inquiry 
the investigation and inquiry include questions as to whether gary a 
prince was acting as a de facto executive officer of the company prior to his promotion to the position of executive vice president and managing director of operations of the company in august and questions as to whether mr 
prince was practicing as an accountant before the sec while an employee of the company 
see item legal proceedings 
the board of directors of the company has established a special committee of independent directors of the company to supervise our responses to such investigation and inquiry and to investigate related matters 
the special committee has retained the law firm of foley hoag llp to serve as its independent counsel 
we are cooperating fully with the sec and nasdaq 
we are unable to determine at this time either the timing of the investigation and inquiry  the impact  if any  which the investigation and inquiry could have on us  or the outcome of the investigation or the inquiry 
risks related to our restatement of our unaudited interim financial statements we may become subject to liability and incur increased expenditures as a result of our restatement of our financial statements 
we and certain of our former and existing officers are the subject of a purported class action lawsuit filed on december   following our december  announcement that we would be restating our unaudited interim financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal year ended september  due to an error in the accounting treatment for certain transactions with respect to the timing of the recognition of revenue between periods due to specific warranty provisions in some of our contracts  accounting for the sale of software licenses and revenue associated with some reimbursable costs on government programs 
the restatement of our previously issued interim unaudited financial statements could expose us to government investigation or additional legal action 
the defense of any such actions could cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we could be required to pay damages to settle such actions or if any such actions are not resolved in our favor 
even if resolved in our favor  such actions could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses 
moreover  we may be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the financial statement inaccuracies and resulting restatement and negative reactions from shareholders  creditors  or others with which we do business 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
failures in our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures could lead to material errors in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
such controls are designed to provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that we are providing reliable financial reports 
if 
table of contents such controls fail to operate effectively  this may result in material errors in our financial statements 
deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting may require remediation  which could be costly 
failure to remediate such deficiencies or to implement required new or improved controls could lead to material errors in our financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  and expose us to government investigation or legal action 
any of these results could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock
