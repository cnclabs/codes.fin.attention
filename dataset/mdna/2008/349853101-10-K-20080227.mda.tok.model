item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american deferred air freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and ten regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including expedited truckload brokerage tlx  dedicated fleets  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
on july   through our newly formed subsidiary and reporting segment  forward air solutions  inc  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of usac for approximately million 
the purchased assets and liabilities and the results of operations of usac have been included in our consolidated financial statements since july  usac was a well established transportation service provider with facilities that specialized in pool distribution services throughout the southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
the acquisition provides the opportunity for us to introduce new services to new and existing customers and to drive efficiencies in existing businesses 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our continued growth depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount and revenue per pound of the freight shipped through our network and to grow other lines of businesses  such as pool distribution and tlx  that will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
in addition  a key factor to success is our ability to efficiently manage our purchased transportation costs through efficient use of our owner operator fleet and more expensive third party transportation providers 
trends and developments during our logistics business continued to experience significant growth while revenues for our airport to airport service grew at a slower rate year over year due to challenging market conditions 
through our strategic initiative completing the model we are continuing our efforts to grow our business through additional services to provide for revenue growth in any market conditions 
new services not only include complimentary services to the airport to airport network  such as pick up and delivery  tlx  and value added handling  but also include entirely new services  such as pool distribution  which provides the opportunity for us to reach out to a more diverse customer base 
we will be working to grow these additional services not only through organic development  but through strategic acquisitions 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions that can increase our penetration of a geographic area  add new customers or increase freight volume 
in addition  we expect to explore acquisitions that enable us to offer additional services 
for example  on december  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of black hawk freight services  inc black hawk for approximately million to increase the penetration of our airport to airport network in the midwest  southwest and west continental united states 
also  on july   we acquired certain asset and liabilities of usac 
through this acquisition we are now providing a new pool distribution service throughout the southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
additionally  the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac provides an important operating platform that will enable further expansion of the forward air complete pick up and delivery product  tlx and value added handling components of the completing the model strategic initiative 
despite providing separate benefits  both acquisitions fit into our goal of using strategic acquisitions to grow existing businesses and to expand into new lines of business 
during  we experienced a decrease in our income from operations in total dollars and as a percentage of operating revenue 
the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of operating revenue was mainly driven by increases in certain fixed and indirect costs and change in our business mix  which increased purchased transportation costs as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in income from operations in total dollars was mainly due to increases in fixed and indirect costs  such as share based compensation  facility rent  and insurance and claims  outpacing the increase in operating revenue and gross profit 
during  we expect the increases in our other revenue streams to continue to outpace the increase in our airport to airport revenue  resulting in lower margins 
however  we believe during  the substantial majority of fixed cost increases were incurred and we expect to increase income from operations in terms of total dollars during during we have continued to execute our plan to expand our facilities in key gateway cities 
in february  we purchased land in dallas fort worth  texas for the construction of a new regional hub 
we also completed our purchase of new facilities in chicago  illinois and atlanta  georgia during march and june  respectively 
with these facilities we believe we will have room to grow our business in key gateway cities and to offer additional services such as value added handling 
segments effective july  in conjunction with fasi s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac  we began reporting our operations as two segments forward air and fasi 
as the creation of the second segment was the result of our july acquisition  no reclassification of prior year financial information was necessary 
our forward air segment includes our pre existing airport to airport and tlx services as well as our other accessorial related services such as warehousing  customs brokerage  and value added handling services 
our fasi segment includes our pool distribution business and the related assets and liabilities purchased from usac 
reclassifications effective january  we reclassified certain and revenue components of the forward air segment between our three product lines to be consistent with current year classifications 
primarily  we reclassified forward air complete revenue from other revenue to airport to airport revenue as management views forward air complete as an extension of our airport to airport network 
also  portions of the fuel surcharge revenue were reclassified between airport to airport and logistics revenue to be consistent with current year presentation

airport to airport revenue  which is the largest component of forward air operating revenue  increased million  or  to million in from million in airport to airport revenue accounted for of the segment s operating revenue during  compared to during the increase in airport to airport revenue was driven by a increase in tonnage and a increase in revenue per pound  including the impact of fuel surcharges 
the increase in tonnage was driven by new airport to airport business generated by forward air complete  our pick up and delivery product introduced during the second half of  our december acquisition of black hawk  and the positive impact of a competitor ceasing operations during the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a generally weak shipping environment 
the increase in average revenue per pound substantially resulted from increased customer utilization of forward air complete  increased fuel surcharges to offset rising fuel costs  and rate increases implemented in march logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in logistics revenue is mainly the result of our completing the model strategic initiative to grow these services 
we are placing emphasis on capturing a larger percentage of truckload opportunities and correspondingly increasing our access to sufficient truckload capacity through the use of third party transportation providers 
during  we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by 
the average revenue per mile of our logistics product  including the impact of fuel surcharges  decreased for versus the decrease in our revenue per mile is largely due to the weak shipping environment and the change in our business mix resulting from our efforts to capture additional truckload opportunities as well as utilizing truckload opportunities to cost effectively position our owner operators within our airport to airport network 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling increased million to million  a increase from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased handling and storage revenue due to new services offered through our newly expanded facilities 
fasi fasi operating revenue of million represents revenue earned through our new pool distribution service acquired with the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac on july  the pool distribution business is seasonal and operating revenues tend to be higher in the third and fourth quarters than the first and second quarters 
typically  this pattern is the result of factors such as national holidays  customer demand and economic conditions 
additionally  a significant portion of fasi s revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by the economy

a increase in miles driven for the airport to airport network accounted for million of the increase in airport to airport purchased transportation 
the increase in airport to airport miles was due to changes in forward air s shipping patterns during the first half of as a result of changes in business mix  such as increased shipments from our west coast terminals 
approximately million of the increase in airport to airport purchased transportation is attributable to a increase in cost per mile 
the increase in the cost per mile is the result of increased customer utilization of forward air complete  which was introduced during the second half of purchased transportation costs related to forward air s logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for for  logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for during  forward air increased the number of miles driven to support logistics revenue by 
the increase in miles accounted for a million increase in logistics purchased transportation 
however  the increase in logistics purchased transportation due to miles was partially offset by a million decrease in logistics purchased transportation as a result of a decrease in the logistics cost per mile 
logistics cost per mile decreased due to increased capacity resulting in improved purchasing power from third party transportation providers and to a lesser extent increased use of our less costly owner operator network 
the increase in logistics purchased transportation costs as a percentage of revenue resulted from lower revenue per mile as discussed above partially offset by the decrease in our logistics cost per mile 
purchased transportation costs related to forward air s other revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue increased to of other revenue for from for the increase in other purchased transportation is attributable to increased third party transportation services associated with new value added services 
fasi fasi purchased transportation of million represents costs associated with payment of drivers  both networked owner operators and third party transportation providers  for the transportation services provided to fasi 
fasi purchased transportation was of the segment s operating revenue 
due to the nature of the services provided fasi purchased transportation is lower as a percentage of revenue than our forward air segment as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers

share based compensation increased million  or as a percentage of forward air operating revenue  due to the issuance of stock options and non vested shares of common stock to key members of management and non employee directors during in addition  workers compensation expense increased million  or as a percentage of forward air operating revenue  primarily due to a million adjustment recorded in june that resulted from our actuarial analysis of our reserves for workers compensation claims 
the remaining increase in total dollars is attributable to increases in our workforce to keep pace with the growth of forward air s business 
fasi fasi salary  wages and employee benefits of million represents costs associated with payment of employees  mainly company drivers and employees located at our terminals since our acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac on july  fasi salary  wages and employee benefits were of the segment s operating revenue

the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was also a result of the change in our business mix resulting from slower growth in revenue from the airport to airport service as a percentage of total revenue and increased revenue from less profitable services such as truckload service and forward air complete 
fasi fasi income from operations since our acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac on july  was million  or of fasi revenue 
as discussed above  we expect the pool distribution business to be highly seasonal and as a result of the timing of the usac acquisition our results primarily include peak seasonal activity 
consequently  we believe our income from operations as a percentage of operating revenue will be lower than experienced during interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for compared with million in the increase in interest expense was mostly the result of million in borrowings under our new line of credit facility primarily to fund our acquisition of black hawk in december and repurchases of our common stock 
other income  net other income  net was million  or of operating revenue  for compared with million  or as a percentage of operating revenue  for the decrease in other income was attributable to lower interest income due to decreased average investment balances as a result of cash used for stock repurchases  purchases of real property for new facilities  and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac during provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for was compared to a rate of for the same period in our effective federal and state rate increased to provide for uncertain tax positions as required by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

the increase in airport to airport revenue was driven by an increase in tonnage and an increase in average revenue per pound 
tonnage that transited our network increased by in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase in tonnage is a result of positive trends among our customer base and the acquisition of certain assets of us express enterprises  inc usx on may  these positive trends were offset by a decline in shipping demand during the last half of  as demonstrated by the decline in our average weight per shipment  despite a increase in total shipments 
our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  including the impact of fuel surcharges  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  average revenue per pound increased primarily as a result of rate increases implemented in march  the introduction of forward air complete and increased fuel surcharges to offset rising fuel costs 
our logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million  accounting for of our total operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  logistics revenue increased despite the loss of a significant customer in the second half of who accounted for approximately million in logistics revenue during the year ended december  the increase in logistics revenue is primarily attributable to our ability to capture a larger percentage of truckload opportunities as a result of our increased access to sufficient capacity through third party transportation providers 
during the year ended december   we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by 
the increase in miles driven is a result of our continued efforts to grow our logistics business and obtain additional customers 
the average revenue per mile of our logistics business  including the impact of fuel surcharges  decreased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the decrease in our revenue per mile is primarily a result of a change in the mix of business 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling and accounts for our final component of operating revenue  increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in other revenue is attributable to increases in other accessorial charges for special shipping needs  offset by decreases in terminal handling fees due to the customer loss discussed in logistics revenue 
purchased transportation purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in miles driven and an approximate increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation increased to during the year ended december  compared to in the same period of for the year ended december   purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network decreased to of airport to airport revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the proportionate improvement resulted from better load factors  or more revenue per mile  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase resulted from decreased logistics revenue per mile discussed above and a increase in our logistics cost per mile 
logistics cost per mile increased as a result of the use of more third party transportation providers as opposed to our less costly fleet of owner operators offset by lower third party transportation provider rates due to our increased capacity and utilization 
other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to a change in the revenue mix resulting from the customer loss discussed in the analysis of logistics revenue 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue is attributable to operating efficiencies gained during the year 
salaries and wages  including payroll taxes  and workers compensation insurance and expenses  which increased by million  or  declined as a percentage of revenue 
salaries and wages and workers compensation insurance and expenses increased to meet the additional demands of the increased tonnage through our network and increased logistics and other services provided to our customers  but declined as a percentage of revenue due to operating efficiencies gained during the year as a result of tap and other management initiatives 
this decrease as a percentage of revenue was offset by a million  or as a percentage of operating revenue  increase in health care costs due to increased participants in our health care plan  as well as a larger number of high dollar claims 
also  during we implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  and issued non vested shares of common stock to certain key employees 
as a result we recognized million  or of operating revenue  in share based compensation that is included in salaries  wages and employee benefits for the year ended december  however  this increase was offset in the year ended december  by a million dollar  or of operating revenue  charge resulting from the decision by our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of all of our outstanding and unvested stock options to employees  officers and non employee directors in the fourth quarter of operating leases operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as operating lease expenses increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase is attributable to expansion of certain facilities resulting in higher facility rent 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  and the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as depreciation and amortization remained consistent year over year 
depreciation decreased million year over year due to the year ended december  including increased depreciation from the accelerated depreciation of trailers sold in the third and fourth quarters of also  depreciation decreased million due to several assets becoming fully depreciated during these decreases were offset by amortization expense increasing during the year ended december  by million  or by five additional months of amortization  due to the purchase of certain assets of usx on may  the decreases were also offset by increased depreciation on new trailers and tractors purchased during late and  as well the depreciation on our new tap system which was fully implemented during insurance and claims insurance and claims were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
the increase in insurance and claims is primarily the result of higher insurance premiums  offset by improved claims experience during the year ended december  additionally  during the year ended december   an actuarial study of our loss development factor for vehicle liability claims was computed and the results of the study caused us to lower our loss development reserve for vehicle liability claims 
other operating expenses other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as other operating expenses increased million  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the million increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the gain on the sale of trailers due to the replacement of approximately half of the trailers in our fleet during the remaining increase in total other operating expenses is attributable to increases in volume related operating expenses  such as fuel  tires  and station handling fees 
income from operations income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue and operating expenses decreasing as a percentage of revenue 
other income  net other income  net was million  or of operating revenue  for the year ended december  compared with million  or of operating revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in other income in total dollars and as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the year ended december  including the million gain from our lawsuit settlement with the city of atlanta regarding property we owned adjacent to the atlanta hartsfield jackson international airport 
this decrease was offset by higher interest income earned during the year ended december  due to higher yields and average investment balances 
the decrease was further offset by including a million gain on the recovery of escrow funds related to a asset purchase 
income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of our total income before taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to collectibility of accounts receivable  self insurance loss reserves  income taxes  share based compensation  and valuation of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our financial position and results of operations may be significantly different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize actuarial analysis to evaluate open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
effective january   we adopted fin accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
see further discussion of income tax contingencies in the impact of recent accounting pronouncements below 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct an annual or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment impairment test of goodwill at the end of the second quarter of each year based on judgments regarding the market value of our common stock  ongoing profitability and cash flow of the underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
the annual impairment test was conducted and it did not result in any impairment charges 
share based compensation prior to january   as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we accounted for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options as options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock paid by employees was not less than of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning and at the end of each purchase period 
effective january   we adopted sfas r and elected the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
share based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be valued in accordance with sfas and stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the statement of income 
on december   our board of directors accelerated the vesting of all of our outstanding and unvested stock options awarded to employees  officers and non employee directors under our stock option award plans 
as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of our outstanding and unvested options in  the company recognized million of stock based compensation in  but there was no additional compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and related to options granted prior to january  our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we utilized stock options as our sole form of share based awards 
during the year ended december   we granted non vested shares of common stock non vested shares to key employees  but returned to granting stock options during the year ended december  we returned to granting stock options to key employees  as we believe stock options more closely link long term compensation with our long term goals 
for non employee directors  we continued to issue non vested shares during the year ended december  stock options granted during the year ended december  expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for these stock options will be recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
based on our historical experience  forfeitures have been estimated 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended december  the fair value of non vested shares issued to employees during and non employee directors during and were estimated using opening market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period  of three years 
forfeitures have been estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
we estimate the forfeitures of dividends paid on non vested shares and record expense for the estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas r 
under the espp  which has been approved by shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
as the espp does not qualify as non compensatory under the requirements of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows on our statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  we classified excess tax benefits as financing cash inflows rather than as operating cash inflows on our statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and sfas r also requires companies to calculate an initial pool of excess tax benefits available at the adoption date to absorb any unused deferred tax assets that may be recognized under sfas r 
the pool includes the net excess tax benefits that would have been recognized if we had adopted sfas for recognition purposes on its effective date 
we have elected to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits under the alternative transition method described in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  which also specifies the method we must use to calculate excess tax benefits reported on the statement of cash flows 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements during june  the fasb issued fin  which was effective for us on january  this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the guidance prescribed in fin establishes a recognition threshold of more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the measurement attribute of fin requires that a tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a million increase in the liability for income tax contingencies  including related interest and penalties  which net of federal benefit of million was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
the liability for income tax contingencies at january  net of federal benefit was million  which represents tax positions where the realization of the ultimate benefit is uncertain and the disallowance of which would affect our annual effective income tax rate 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states  and canada 
with a few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or canadian examinations by tax authorities for years before the total liability balance at december  consists of state tax positions for which the realization of the ultimate benefit is uncertain and the disallowance of which would affect our annual effective income tax rate 
these positions mainly consist of deductions taken on state tax returns for which the ultimate deductibility is highly uncertain and the position that certain subsidiaries are not subject to income taxes by certain states 
as permitted by fin  we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses 
during september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with earlier adoption encouraged 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  the application of sfas could change current practice 
we currently plan to adopt sfas as of january   but are still evaluating the impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we currently plan to adopt sfas no 
on january   but are still evaluating the impact on our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital purchases  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in for cash provided by operating activities  the million decrease in net income and the million increase in accounts receivable were offset by a million increase in non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and share based compensation 
further offsetting the decrease in net income were reduced federal and state estimated tax payments and increases in our accounts payables outstanding 
current year estimated tax payments were reduced to take advantage of prior year overpayments 
the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were driven by the increased activity associated with our acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million provided by investing activities in investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of the purchases of our new chicago  illinois and atlanta  georgia facilities  the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac and black hawk and the purchase of land near dallas fort worth  texas 
partially funding these activities were sales or maturities of our available for sale securities 
proceeds from the sales or maturities of our available for sale securities during the year ended december  were also used to fund stock repurchases as further outlined below in our discussion of cash used for financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities for the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to million in net borrowings under our line of credit  offset by a million increase in shares repurchased and a million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
borrowings from our line of credit were primarily used to fund the acquisition of black hawk and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of share repurchases increased and option proceeds decreased in over as a result of a decrease in the average market value of our shares making repurchases more attractive and the exercise of stock options less attractive

under the previous credit facility as long as we complied with the financial covenants and ratios  the credit facility permits us to borrow up to million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
interest rates for advances under the facility vary based on how our performance measures against covenants related to total indebtedness  cash flows  results of operations and other ratios 
the facility bears interest at libor plus to and is unsecured 
the facility s expiration is april at december   we had no balance outstanding under the line of credit facility and had utilized approximately million of availability for outstanding letters of credit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility  which represents an aggregate principal amount of million at december   bears interest at variable rates 
based on our borrowings during  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of would have increased our annual interest expense by less than million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by less than million 
our only other debt are equipment notes and capital lease obligations totaling million 
these notes and lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there is no exposure to market risk related to these notes and capital lease obligations 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are also subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our management and approved by our board of directors 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high credit quality securities with relatively short term maturities 
as of december   we had short term investments of million 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our portfolio
