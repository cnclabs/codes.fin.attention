merchant banking fund management  which currently consists primarily of management of greenhill s private equity funds  greenhill capital partners or gcp  greenhill s venture capital fund  gsavp  greenhill capital partners europe or gcp europe  and principal investments by greenhill in those funds 
historically  our financial advisory business has accounted for the majority of our revenues  and we expect that to remain so for the near to medium term  although there may be periods  such as the first quarter of  in which merchant banking results outweigh our financial advisory earnings 
the main driver of the financial advisory business is overall mergers and acquisitions  or m a  and restructuring volume  particularly in the industry sectors and geographic markets in which we focus 
in addition  new managing director hires add incrementally to our revenue and income growth potential 
the principal drivers of our merchant banking fund management revenues are realized and unrealized gains on investments and profit overrides  the size and timing of which are tied to a number of different factors including the performance of the particular companies in which we invest  general 
table of contents economic conditions in the debt and equity markets and other factors which affect the industries in which we invest  such as commodity prices 
our revenues can fluctuate materially depending on the number and size of completed transactions on which we advised and the levels of gain realized on our merchant banking investments  as well as other factors 
accordingly  the revenues in any particular year may not be indicative of future results 
business environment economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
see risk factors 
net income and revenues in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
at the same time  worldwide completed m a volume increased by  from  billion in to  billion in  and aggregate advisory revenue reported by the four largest us based investment banks by revenue that publicly disclose their advisory fee revenue increased by from billion in to billion in from a longer term perspective  our financial advisory revenues were higher than in  while the aggregate advisory revenue reported by the same four investment banks was higher than in merchant banking and other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents a decrease of 
merchant banking revenues principally consisted of realized and unrealized gains on investments in gcp  merchant banking profit overrides and management fees 
while the amount of management fees earned from our existing merchant banking funds are principally a function of the amount of capital invested in the case of gcp i or committed in the case of gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe  those portions of merchant banking revenues consisting of gains and profit overrides may vary considerably depending on economic conditions and the performance of the individual companies in which we invest 
during  several gcp portfolio companies benefited from favorable conditions in the financing markets 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  commodity prices  credit and public equity markets could impact negatively the amount of financial advisory and merchant banking revenue realized by the firm

we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue  and each revenue generating engagement  which typically relates to only one potential transaction  is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  and our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we gain new clients each year through our business development initiatives  by recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from chief executives  directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
at the same time  we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
we earn a majority of our financial advisory revenue from completion fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a merger  acquisition  restructuring or similar transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals and adverse market conditions 
in certain client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  we earn a significant portion of our revenue in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment but are not necessarily linked to the end result 
we do not allocate our financial advisory revenue by type of advice rendered m a  restructuring or other because of the complexity of the assignments for which we earn revenue 
for example  a restructuring assignment can involve  and in some cases end successfully in  a sale of all or part of the financially distressed client 
likewise  an acquisition assignment can relate to a financially distressed target involved in or considering a restructuring 
finally  an m a assignment can be received from a relationship that derives from a prior restructuring assignment  and vice versa 
versus financial advisory revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
the increase reflected generally high levels of m a volume  increasing demand for independent advisors and our continuing business development efforts

management fees are generally charged based upon a percentage of committed capital ranging from to during the year commitment period and as a percentage of invested capital ranging from to after the termination of the commitment period 
our management fees also include portions of other transactions fees which may be paid directly to us by portfolio companies of the merchant banking funds 
for  we expect to earn approximately million in management fees from gcp i 
the amount of management fees earned from gcp i is dependent on the amount of invested capital and will decline over the remaining life of the fund as investments are liquidated a process which we expect will end by 
we currently earn annual fees from gcp ii of app roximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
we currently earn annual fees from gsavp of approximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
we earned fees from gcp europe of approximately million in and we expect to earn an annual amount of million during through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 

table of contents depending upon the performance of our funds  we will record investment income or losses based upon our allocable share of invested capital in our funds 
net realized and unrealized gains on investments in merchant banking are comprised of investment income  realized and unrealized gains from the firm s investments in merchant banking funds  and the consolidated earnings of the general partners of these funds in which we have a majority economic interest  offset by allocated expenses of the funds 
that portion of the earnings of the general partner exclusive of profit overrides which is held by employees of the firm is recorded as minority interest 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
to the extent we make other principal investments  we will also recognize revenue based on the realized and unrealized gains or losses from such investments on a quarterly basis 
we record our investments at estimated fair value 
investments in privately held companies are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value and generally adjusted after being held by the fund for one year to the estimated fair value as determined by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
discounts are generally applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investment in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments 
significant changes in the fair value of our investments may have a material effect  positive or negative  on our re venues and thus the results of operations 
as the general partner of our merchant banking funds  we make investment decisions for the funds and are entitled to receive from the funds an override of the profits of the funds 
in aggregate  we and our employees are entitled to a profit override percentage of of the profits earned by unaffiliated investors in gcp i  and with certain exceptions  for all investors except the firm in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe 
we are deemed to have the majority of the economic interest in the managing general partner of gcp i and the general partners of gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  effective for investments made beginning early 
under fin r we include as consolidated revenue all realized and unrealized profit overrides earned by the managing general partners of gcp i for all investments made after january   gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe 
from an economic perspective  profit overrides in respect of such investments are allocated to the firm and to employees of the firm 
the economic share of the profit overrides allocated to the employees of the firm is recorded as compensation expense 
because we include in our revenues all of the profit overrides earned from investments made on or after january   we expect that as the investments mature and  depending upon market conditions  that the amount of our profit overrides could increase 
the amount of profit overrides we recognize as revenue will depend upon the underlying fair value of the portfolio company and is subject to the volatility referred to above 
we recognize merchant banking profit overrides when certain financial returns are achieved over the life of the fund 
profit overrides are generally calculated as a percentage of the profits over a specified threshold earned by such funds on investments managed on behalf of unaffiliated investors for gcp i and principally all investors except the firm for gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp 
overrides are generally calculated on a deal by deal basis but are subject to investment performance over the life of each merchant banking fund 
we may be required to pay back a portion of the overrides to the limited partners of the funds in the event a minimum performance level is not achieved by the fund as a whole we refer to these potential repayments as clawbacks 
we would be required to establish a reserve for potential clawbacks if we were to 
table of contents determine that the likelihood of a clawback is deemed probable and the amount of the clawback can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we have not reserved for any clawback obligations under applicable fund agreements 
versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management and other revenue compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to lower principal investment gains and related profit overrides  offset by greater interest income and slightly higher asset management fees resulting from greater assets under management 
in total  gcp and the firm earned revenues relating to portfolio companies and incurred losses relating to portfolio company in gcp and the firm earned revenues relating to portfolio companies and incurred losses relating to one portfolio company in the firm had no investments in or that contributed more than to total revenues in those years

versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management other revenue compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to higher management fees resulting from a full year of management of gcp ii and the establishment of gsavp 
net investment gains and profit overrides were comparable in and in total  gcp and the firm earned revenues relating to portfolio companies and incurred losses relating to one portfolio company in gcp and the firm earned revenue from portfolio companies in the firm had no investments in that contributed more than to total revenues and one investment in that contributed more than to total revenues 
included in merchant banking fund management amp  other revenue for the years ended december  and is million and million  respectively related to the portion of the interests in the general partners of gcp which are held directly by employees of the firm  which is deducted as minority interest 
the investment gains or losses in our investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly over time due to factors beyond our control  such as individual portfolio company performance  equity market valuations and merger and acquisition opportunities 
revenue recognized from gains recorded in the  and are not necessarily indicative of revenue that may be realized in future periods 
operating expenses our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  which compares to million of total operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  principally reflects an increase in compensation expense which is described in more detail below 
the pre tax income margin was in and in we classify operating expenses as compensation and benefits expense and non compensation expenses 
management does not separately evaluate operating expenses by financial advisory and merchant banking activities 
operating expenses apart from compensation have been modest in proportion to revenues  as a result of the relatively small number of staff and related costs including travel  office space  communications  information services  depreciation  professional services and interest expense that the firm bears 
a portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements 
in addition  until august  barrow street capital subleased office space from us and reimbursed us for the use of other facilities and participation in our health care plans 

table of contents the following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses  which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients and merchant banking portfolio companies

compensation and benefits the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
it is our policy that our total compensation and benefits  including that payable to our managing directors and senior advisors  will not exceed of total revenues each year although we retain the ability to change this policy in the future 
the actual compensation expense ratio is determined by management in consultation with the compensation committee and based on such factors as the relative level of revenues  the anticipated compensation requirements which may vary depending on the level of recruitment of new managing directors in any given period and other factors  and the level of other costs and expenses 
the compensation we pay to our employees consists of base salary and benefits  cash bonus awards and the award of restricted stock units 
base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year 
cash bonuses  which are accrued each period  are discretionary and dependent upon on number of factors  including the performance of the firm 
discretionary cash bonus payments are paid annually in february following year end 
awards of restricted stock units are also discretionary and amortized to compensation expense based upon the value of the award at the time of grant during the service period over which the award vests  which is generally five years 
as we expense these awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
in january  our employees were granted  restricted stock units in conjunction with the compensation 
versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  the increase of million or is primarily due to the higher level of revenues in compared to for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was the same as versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  the increase of million or is primarily due to higher level of revenues in compared to for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was the same as our compensation expense is generally based upon revenue and can fluctuate materially in any particular year depending upon the amount of revenue recognized as well as other factors 
accordingly  the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular year may not be indicative of compensation expense in a future period 

table of contents non compensation expense our non compensation expense includes the costs for occupancy and rental  communications  information services  professional fees  recruiting  travel and entertainment  insurance  depreciation  interest expense and other operating expenses 
reimbursable client expenses are netted against non compensation expenses 
we expect that our non compensation costs  particularly occupancy  travel and information services costs  will increase as we grow our business and make strategic investments 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase is principally related to an increase in interest expense related to greater short term borrowings  slightly higher occupancy and other costs associated with new office space in london  frankfurt  new york and toronto  and greater travel and information service costs  offset in part by realized foreign currency gains and a decrease in provisions for legal contingencies in as compared to non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  was 
this compares to for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in as compared to reflects a small increase in non compensation costs spread over greater revenue 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase in as compared to is related principally to expenses and provisions for legal contingencies  increases in occupancy and other costs associated with new office space in london and new york  losses from foreign currency movements  and greater information services and travel costs primarily as a result of the growth in personnel and business development activities  offset in part by the absence of a third party fee related to fundraising for gcp ii and a charge for uncollectible accounts 
non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the firm s non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue can vary as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuation in annual revenue amounts  the amount of recruiting and business development activity  the amount of reimbursement of engagement related expenses by clients  the amount of our short term borrowings  interest rate and currency movements and other factors 
accordingly  the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in any particular year may not be indicative of the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
provision for income taxes we are subject to federal  foreign and state corporate income taxes 
in addition  certain of our non us subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their local jurisdictions 
versus for the year ended december   the provision for taxes was million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 
this compares to a provision for taxes for the year ended december  of million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately for the year 
the increase in the provision for taxes in as compared to principally results from higher pre tax income partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate based on the fact that a greater proportion of our pre tax income was earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
versus for the year ended december   the provision for taxes was million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 
this compares to a provision for taxes for the year ended december  of million based on an effective tax rate of approximately 
the increase in the provision for taxes is primarily due to the higher pre tax income 
the lower effective tax rate in as compared to results from the fact that a greater proportion of our income was earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions  as well as  lower state and local income taxes 

table of contents the effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the relative amounts of advisory and merchant banking income earned in the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates and invests 
accordingly  the effective tax rate in any particular period may not be indicative of the effective tax rate in future periods 
geographic data for a summary of the total revenues  income before minority interest and tax  net income and total assets by geographic region  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position is monitored by our management committee  which generally meets monthly 
the management committee monitors cash  other significant working capital assets and liabilities  debt  principal investment commitments and other matters relating to liquidity requirements 
as cash accumulates it is invested in short term investments expected to provide significant liquidity 
we generate cash from both our operating activities in the form of advisory and asset management fees and our merchant banking investments in the form of distributions of investment proceeds and profit overrides 
we use our cash primarily for operating purposes  compensation of our employees  payment of income taxes  investments in merchant banking funds  payment of dividends  repurchase of shares of our stock and leasehold improvements 
our cash balances generally accumulate from our operating activities during the year 
in general  we collect our accounts receivable within days except for certain restructuring transactions where collections may take longer due to court ordered holdbacks 
our liabilities typically consist of accounts payable  which are generally paid monthly  accrued compensation  which includes accrued bonuses that are paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees  and taxes payable 
in the first quarter of  cash bonuses of million relating to compensation were paid to our employees 
in addition  we expect to pay approximately million in early related to income taxes owed for the year ended december  a portion of our liabilities are associated with unrealized investment earnings ie  recorded on our books but for which cash proceeds have not yet been received from our merchant banking funds 
at december  approximately million of our bonus accrual related to profit overrides for unrealized gains of our merchant banking funds and million related to tax liabilities that are deferred until the gains from the merchant banking fund investments are realized 
these amounts may increase or decrease depending on the change in the fair value of the investments in the funds and are payable  subject to clawback  at the time the funds realize cash proceeds 
since our initial public offering we have used a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock  pay dividends and make investments in our merchant banking funds 
our commitments to our merchant banking funds may require us to fund capital calls on short notice 
on the other hand  distributions from our merchant banking funds are generally made shortly after proceeds are received by the funds 
we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of share repurchase opportunities  capital call requirements or distribution of investment proceeds 
our merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies 
the ability of our merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds  including general economic and sector conditions  stock market conditions  the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities  among others 
as a result we consider our investments illiquid for the short term 
to increase our financial flexibility  during  we increased our revolving loan facility to million to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of merchant banking investments and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility are secured by all management fees earned by greenhill capital partners  llc and greenhill venture partners  llc and any cash distributed in respect of their partnership interests in gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp  as applicable 
interest on borrowings is based on libor plus 

table of contents because it is not tax efficient  our foreign earnings are generally not available to fund our us working capital needs  including share purchases  dividend payments or merchant banking investments 
accordingly  we fund such working capital needs in the us with cash from operations and short term borrowings 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on june  at december   million of borrowings were outstanding on the loan facility 
as of december   we had total commitments not reflected on our balance sheet relating to future principal investments in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe and other merchant banking and related activities of million 
these commitments are expected to be drawn on from time to time and be substantially invested over a period of up to five years from the relevant commitment dates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in open market purchases at an average price of per share 
additionally  we are deemed to have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average of per share in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to our employees in settlement of restricted stock units 
the firm has remaining authorization to repurchase up to million of common stock in open market or other transactions 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and funds available from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  commitments to our merchant banking activities  build out costs of new office space  tax obligations  share repurchases and common dividends 
in the event that our needs for liquidity should increase as we expand our business  we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs

a we may be required to substantially fund our merchant banking commitments at any time through  depending on the timing and level of investments by gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp  although we do not expect these commitments to be drawn in full 
since the merchant banking commitments can be drawn at any time over the life of the commitment period  the amounts above are shown as if spread ratably over the life of the primary commitment period 
in  the firm increased its revolving loan facility to million to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of short term investments and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings under this facility are secured by all management fees earned by greenhill capital partners  llc and greenhill venture partners  llc and any cash distributed in respect of their partnership interests in gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp  as applicable 
interest on borrowings is based on one month libor plus 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on june  at december   million of borrowings were outstanding on the loan facility 
subsequent events on february   we completed the offering of units in ghl acquisition corp  a blank check company sponsored by us 
in the offering  ghl acquisition corp 
sold  units for an aggregate purchase price of  we bought  units of which up to  units are subject to forfeiture if the underwriters overallotment option in respect of the offering is not exercised in full and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of ghl acquisition corp 
for an aggregate purchase price of  following the completion of the offering  we own approximately of the outstanding common stock of ghl acquisition corp 
market risk we limit our investments to short term cash investments  which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk  equity price risk or other market risk and principal investments made in gcp  gsavp  gcp europe and other merchant banking funds and similar vehicles 
we have invested our cash in short duration  highly rated fixed income investments including treasury bills and money market funds 
changes in interest rates and other economic and market conditions could affect these investments adversely  however  we do not believe that any such changes will have a material effect on our results of operations 
we monitor the quality of these investments on a regular basis and may choose to diversify such investments to mitigate perceived market risk 
our short term cash investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  pounds sterling and euros  and we face modest foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in accounts outside the united states due to potential currency movements and the associated accounting requirements 
to the extent that the cash balances in local currency exceed our short term obligations  we may hedge our foreign currency exposure 

table of contents with regard to our principal investments including our portion of any profit overrides earned on such investments  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which we and our merchant banking funds invest  which historically has been volatile 
significant changes in the public equity markets may have a material effect on our results of operations 
volatility in the general equity markets would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of our merchant banking or principal investments that are publicly traded securities 
we have analyzed our potential exposure to general equity market risk by performing sensitivity analyses on those investments held by us and in our merchant banking funds which consist of publicly traded securities 
this analysis showed that if we assume that at december   the market prices of all public securities were lower  the impact on our operations would be a decrease in revenues of million

the respective investment committees manage the risks associated with the merchant banking portfolios by closely monitoring and managing the types of investments made as well as the monetization and realization of existing investments

we do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates 
we analyzed our potential exposure to a decline in exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income 
because of the decline in value of the dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro in  our earnings in were higher than they would have been had the value of the dollar relative to those other currencies remained constant 
however  we do not believe we face any material risk in respect of exchange rate movements
