information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or incurred costs reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the company records income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of the company s business on projects where the company is contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a regular basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
net deferred tax asset the company has approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of june  during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company released the entire million tax valuation allowance that was previously established against such assets due to the improved earnings and likelihood of using such assets in future periods 
the company anticipates that the majority of available deferred tax assets will be utilized over the next to months 
asset retirement obligation during fiscal year  the company recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the estimated clean up costs for its chemical laboratory in its national security business segment 
in accordance with sfas  the company estimated the costs to clean up the laboratory and return it to its original state at a present value of approximately  the company currently estimates the amortization and accreation expense to be approximately  to  per year over the next years 
the company is rigorously pursuing reimbursement for such costs and other costs from the us army as a significant portion of the chemical agent that was used in the chemical laboratory was government owned 
if the company determines that the estimated clean up cost is larger than expected or the likelihood of recovery from the us army is remote  such adjustments will be reflected when they become known in accordance with sfas at june   the company has accrued approximately  long term liability to clean up the chemical laboratory 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is approximately  relating to the acquisition of versar global solutions  inc  which is now part of the program management business segment 
the program management business segment was broken out separately in fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in business volume in iraq and in the united states construction related work 
in performing its goodwill impairment analysis  management has utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the program management business segment 
management engages outside professionals and valuation experts  as necessary  to assist in performing this analysis 
an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of the program management business segment exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of million on an enterprise value basis by a substantial margin 
should the program management business segments financial performance not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact the company s cash flow or financial debt covenants
