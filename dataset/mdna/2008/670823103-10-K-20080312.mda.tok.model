item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading casual dining restaurant company headquartered in nashville  tennessee 
we own and operate three restaurant concepts under the o charley s  ninety nine and stoney river legendary steaks trade names 
as of december   we operated o charley s company owned restaurants in states in the southeast and midwest  ninety nine restaurants in nine northeastern states  and ten stoney river restaurants in six states in the southeast and midwest 
as of december   we had eight franchised o charley s restaurants including four franchised o charley s restaurants in michigan and one franchised o charley s restaurant in ohio  one franchised o charley s restaurant in pennsylvania  one franchised restaurant in iowa and one franchised restaurant in tennessee 
as of december   we had two joint venture o charley s restaurants in louisiana and one joint venture o charley s restaurant in wisconsin  in all of which we have an ownership interest 
approximately two years ago we began our turnaround and transformation effort  which has resulted in the development of our strategic plan focused on the following key elements 
strengthening the organization with a new core of talent and building a winning team 
as part of our multi year effort to build a winning team  we announced a number of changes to our management team during the fiscal year 
we hired a new chief development officer  a new vice president of design and construction  and new vice presidents of human resources and culinary development for the o charley s concept 
we also made changes to the operating organization of the o charley s concept  including the promotion of a new vice president of operations  and new regional vice presidents 
we also made changes to our human resources organization to strengthen support in the field and reduce costs 
these changes followed the recruiting and hiring of several members of our senior management team during recent years  including our chief financial officer  chief supply chain officer and o charley s concept president 
during  we began a new leadership assessment and development process that we believe will strengthen our management teams at our restaurants and support centers 
improving box economics through the execution of product and labor cost management and increasing same store sales through new product offerings  new marketing  and a more analytical approach to menu pricing 
box economics refers to the relationship between our investments in our restaurants and its impact on our sales and related operating margin 
we believe that the completion of our supply chain conversion  the new labor scheduling system that we are currently implementing and the rollout of our new kitchen display system technology in will provide cost savings while improving guest satisfaction 
we believe that these efforts had a positive impact in on our restaurant level margin  which we define as restaurant sales minus the cost of food and beverage  payroll and benefits  and restaurant operating costs 
while same store sales and guest counts decreased at o charley s  average check increased by percent during a portion of the decline in guest counts at o charley s was expected  as we have phased out approximately percent of our kids eat free program 
however  given the challenging consumer environment and competitor discounting  the decline in guest counts has been greater than we anticipated 
we believe that the kids eat free offering is not consistent with the positioning of the brand and its phase out will enhance the o charley s concept consumer appeal and financial performance 
we increased our advertising spending as a percent of sales in in order to improve consumer awareness of our brands 
our project revo lution and project dressed to the nines teams continue to focus on box economics by  among other initiatives  training and implementing new service standards  introducing new kitchen technology and menu engineering  capitalizing on dining room efficiencies and applying these improvements along with our re brandings of our o charley s and ninety nine restaurants 
another important aspect of our re branding is the introduction of concept specific elements  including new uniforms  plateware  menu designs  curbside to go service and new service standards 
during  we completed project revo lution re brandings at our o charley s restaurants  and dressed to the nines re brandings at our ninety nine restaurants 
as of december   we have completed project revo lution re brandings at our o charley s restaurants  and dressed to the nines re brandings at our ninety nine restaurants since the inception of the re branding programs 
we evaluate the results of our re branding initiatives by comparing the changes in sales and profits at a re branded restaurant with changes in sales and profits at a control group or restaurants 
on the basis of this analysis we believe that our re branding initiatives are producing returns on investment that meet or exceed our targets 
we intend to complete approximately re brandings at ninety nine and re brandings at o charley s in we have also introduced a new prototype for our o charley s and ninety nine restaurants 
as of december   we have opened five new company operated o charley s restaurants featuring the concept s new prototype design and one ninety nine restaurant featuring the new prototype design 
we have also opened three franchised o charley s restaurants and one joint venture o charley s restaurant featuring the concept s new prototype design 
achieving high guest satisfaction and intent to return by instilling a passion to serve sm 
in  we adopted a vision statement a passion to serve sm 
this statement describes our commitment to our guests  each other  our stakeholders and our communities 
our vision is to be the best of class in food and service in our segments of the restaurant industry 
we are holding ourselves to higher standards as measured by our guest satisfaction index or  gsi  as we believe that the best marketing takes place within our restaurants 
many of our project revo lution and project dressed to the nines initiatives are designed to improve the guest experience 
our senior management teams at ninety nine and o charley s have implemented a combination of in store and market focus groups designed to solicit feedback about how we can continue to improve our delivery of great food and service 
we believe that an increase in average check requires sustainable improvement in the guest experience 
project revo lution and project dressed to the nines are key elements in our effort to achieve higher guest satisfaction 
our product development teams at all three concepts continue to deliver great tasting menu offerings with unique flavor profiles 
we believe that we are taking the appropriate steps to generate profitable and sustainable growth while enhancing shareholder value 
improving the performance of our supply chain 
we completed the sale of our nashville commissary facility in the second quarter of  and entered into agreements to outsource distribution  meat and poultry processing  and other manufacturing operations 
the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of o charley s branded food products to retailers have also been outsourced 
the transition was completed in the fourth quarter 
we continue to operate our distribution facility in bellingham  massachusetts  which provides distribution services to all ninety nine restaurants 
while no decisions have been made  we are considering whether we should continue to operate this facility or outsource its operation to another company 
with the majority of the transition now complete  we believe that our supply chain team is better positioned to focus upon improving the quality and cost of our products 
we expect that the restructuring of our supply chain will reduce our ongoing costs and expenses by a total of between and million per year  or between and per diluted share  with approximately half of this amount representing reductions in our cost of food and beverage  and half representing reductions in depreciation expense

fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of charges incurred as part of our turnaround and transformation efforts 
impairment  severance  and transition charges relating to the sale of the commissary and other supply chain changes reduced our income from operations in by million 
severance  recruiting and relocation charges relating to our organization changes reduced income from operations in by million  and reduced income from operations in by million 
we also continued to incur a number of charges relating to our re branding initiatives  including initial expenses for advertising and preopening  accelerated depreciation for the assets removed from the restaurant  and ongoing depreciation charges for the new investments 
these charges and expenses reduced our income from operations by million during and by million during the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was also impacted by restaurant impairment charges in both years  and by the impact of the rd week in during we recorded impairment charges for one restaurant that we closed and for five restaurants that have remained open 
these asset impairment charges  net of gains on related asset sales  reduced income from operations in by million 
in comparison  restaurant impairment charges net of gains reduced income from operations in by million 
we estimate that the rd week of contributed revenue of million  and income from operations of million 
revenues as progressed  the us economy experienced a slow down in consumer spending  as consumers increasingly reacted to declining home prices  increased prices for energy and food  and turbulence in the credit markets 
these trends had a negative impact on our sales and guest counts in during  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  we increased average check at all of our concepts  partially offset by a decrease in guest visits at all of our concepts 
the increase in average check and decrease in guest counts was attributable to the partial phase out of the kids eat free program at our o charley s concept  the reduction of promotional coupons and a more analytical approach to menu pricing at all of our concepts in we had a net addition of three company owned restaurants in o charley s company operated restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of a rd week in  as compared to a week year in during  same store sales for o charley s company operated restaurants declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent partially offset by an increase in average check of percent

cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point improvement in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in reflects the impact of our higher average check for all of our concepts which is primarily due to higher margins on our limited time offers  a more analytical approach to menu pricing and the continued reduction of our kids eat free program at our o charley s concept  partially offset by higher costs on most food commodities 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to higher minimum wage rates  the de leveraging impact of the reductions in guest counts and higher employee benefit costs

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this basis point decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of decreased bonus compensation expense as no bonuses were accrued for  or paid to  the executive officers as our earnings per diluted share were below the bonus threshold level 
this decrease was offset by higher costs associated with our share based compensation plans and professional fees 
depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent  in the increase in deprecation and amortization is primarily attributable to our capital expenditures over the past two years and for charges taken for accelerated depreciation associated with our re brandings initiative

income taxes during  our income tax expense decreased million to a million tax benefit  compared with million of tax expense in the prior year 
our effective tax rate was a negative percent in compared to percent in this decrease was the result of reduced levels of pretax profit in along with the value of our tax credits for the fica tip credit and the work opportunities tax credit that were higher than our tax liability at the statutory rate

cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point improvement in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in the year reflects the impact of higher average checks and lower costs for poultry  cheese and cooking oils and by a further narrowing of the gap between our theoretical and actual food costs at the o charley s concept  partially offset by higher costs for beef and seafood  and higher fuel related distribution costs 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales  in reflecting an improvement of basis points 
payroll and benefits costs as a percentage of restaurant sales were lower at the o charley s concept when compared to the prior year

r  share based payment 
depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization expense was million as compared to million in and was flat as a percentage of total revenues at percent

pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs decreased approximately million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the percent decrease is due to company owned restaurant openings in as compared to company owned restaurant openings in interest expense  net our net interest costs were million in as compared to million in interest expense during reflects million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of percent  approximately million weighted average debt outstanding on our million revolving credit facility  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs

on october   we entered into a five year million secured revolving credit facility  which amended and restated our million secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on november  income taxes during  our income tax expense increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in our effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in this increase was primarily attributable to higher pretax earnings 
outlook we expect to report net earnings per diluted share of between and for the fiscal year ending december  projected results for include anticipated charges of between and per diluted share related to the re branding of approximately restaurants  and the roll out of kitchen display systems to more than restaurants 
given current economic conditions  our guidance anticipates flat or declining same store sales for the year 
for fiscal  we have locked in our pricing for over percent of our estimated requirements for beef and poultry  approximately percent of our requirements for pork  and almost half of our requirements for seafood 
using a constant product mix  our locked in pricing for is between zero and one percent higher for beef  between eight and nine percent higher for poultry  between three and four percent higher for pork  and between four and five percent lower for seafood than the average prices paid for similar products during in  we expect to open between three and five new o charley s company operated restaurants  between two and four new ninety nine restaurants  and one or two new stoney river restaurants 
we expect to spend between million and million for capital investments during our guidance for does not reflect any impact for share repurchases  organizational or other changes relating to our transition efforts  or any proxy related charges or expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and capital leases 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to the fact that most of our sales are received as cash or credit card charges  and we have reinvested our cash in new restaurant development and re branding efforts 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
to the extent operations generate cash in excess of working capital and development needs  we have historically invested this cash in overnight repurchase agreements 
as previously announced  we have slowed our restaurant development in order to focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants 
we opened five company owned o charley s restaurants and two ninety nine restaurants but no stoney river restaurants during as part of our focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants  we completed o charley s restaurants re brandings and ninety nine restaurant re brandings during and since inception have completed o charley s restaurant re brandings and ninety nine restaurant re brandings as of december  on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement amended and restated our existing senior secured credit facility entered into on november  the credit agreement as amended  provides for a five year  million revolving credit facility and permits us to request an increase in the principal amount of the facility of up to million 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility  except for approximately million in letters of credit which reduce our available borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties  negative covenants and events of default 
it requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including an adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio  a senior secured leverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio and capital expenditures ratio 
we were in compliance with such covenants at december  the interest rates per annum applicable to loans outstanding under the credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either a base rate or a libor rate  in each case plus an applicable margin percent to percent in the case of base rate loans and percent to percent in the case of libor rate loans  depending on our senior secured leverage ratio 
at december   our margin applicable to libor loans was percent 
in addition to the interest payments required under the credit agreement  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the aggregate average daily unused portion of the credit facility equal to percent to percent per annum  depending on our senior secured leverage ratio 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the capital stock of our material subsidiaries but excluding real property acquired after november  
except as otherwise provided in the credit agreement  the credit agreement will mature on october  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was million and is based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is percent 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on our percent senior subordinated notes due and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
these swap agreements expire in november as discussed above  our net interest expense was substantially lower in  as compared to primarily due to the increase in interest income which resulted from our negotiation of an increase in the rates that we were receiving on our overnight repurchase agreements with our bank combined with lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
on may   we announced the authorization by our board of directors to increase to million our share repurchase authorization 
during the company repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million 
subsequent to december   we announced that our board of directors approved a million increase in our share repurchase authorization 
with the increased authorization  we can repurchase an additional million of our common stock 
the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for strategic initiatives  repayment of debt  current stock price  and other factors 
o charley s inc may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market under a rule b plan or in private transactions  including structured transactions 
the share repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time

these purchase obligations are primarily food obligations with fixed commitments in regards to the time period of the contract with annual price adjustments that can fluctuate and a fixed beverage contract with an annual price adjustment 
in situations where the price is based on market prices  we use the existing market prices at december  to determine the amount of the obligation 
of the total unconditional purchase obligations shown  million is based on variable pricing that is adjusted annually 
this pertains to our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding on this revolving credit facility 
we have approximately million of outstanding letters of credit as of december   which reduces the capacity of the revolving credit facility but is not funded debt 
as of december   we have approximately million remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
as noted in footnote nine in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  this credit facility was amended and restated on october   with a maturity date of october  joint ventures and franchise arrangements in connection with our franchising initiative  we have entered into joint venture arrangements to develop and operate o charley s restaurants 
for any franchisee or joint venture partner in which we have an ownership interest  we may make loans to the joint venture entity and or guarantee certain of its debt and obligations 
while we continue to work towards increasing our number of franchised restaurants  as of december   we do not intend to do so pursuant to joint venture agreements 
to date  we have invested in two joint ventures for the development of o charley s restaurants 
on august   we invested in a joint venture for the development of three o charley s restaurants in certain markets in southern louisiana 
on november   we invested in a joint venture for the development of three o charley s restaurants in wisconsin 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreements for both of the joint ventures  ownership of the joint venture entity is shared equally between us and our joint venture partner 
the joint venture entity is managed by a board of managers composed of two individuals designated by the joint venture partner and two individuals designated by us 
the joint venture partner was required to make capital contributions in the aggregate amount of  to the joint venture entity and we agreed to make initial loans to the joint venture entity in the maximum principal amount of  the loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of the joint venture entity and are partially guaranteed by the joint venture partner 
in order to assist our first joint venture jfc enterprises  llc to open its restaurants  we decided to make additional loans to the joint venture  and as of december   we had advanced a total of approximately million to the joint venture 
in addition  the joint venture has been given access to a million loan through ge capital franchise finance corporation  which we guarantee 
these loans funded most of the investment in the building and equipment  and the start up and operating losses incurred in the joint venture s restaurants 
although we are not obligated to do so  we are likely to fund future operating losses 
in similar fashion to our first joint venture  in order to assist our second joint venture wi tenn restaurants  llc to open its restaurants  we decided to make additional loans to the joint venture  and as of december   we had advanced a total of approximately million to the joint venture 
this loan funded most of the investment in the building and equipment  and the start up and operating losses incurred in the joint venture s restaurants 
we are currently in a dispute with our joint venture partner in wi tenn restaurants  llc 
see item legal proceedings 
under fin r  both joint ventures are variable interest entities  as we do not anticipate them having sufficient equity to fund their operations 
since we have borne a disproportionate share of the financial risk associated with the joint ventures  we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures  and in accordance with fin r  we consolidate the joint ventures in our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience  outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting share based compensation property and equipment goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets income taxes lease accounting on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting the period of time used for the amortization of leasehold improvements  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concludes in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be expensed 
our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  generally inclusive of one renewal period 
the term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
share based compensation effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments including stock options 
we did not record stock option expense prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  because the intrinsic value of our grants was zero on the respective grant dates 
however  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r we presented a proforma disclosure of stock option expense using grant date fair value measurements 
we did  however  record the expense of restricted non vested awards prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as a result  share based compensation for fiscal and includes compensation expense  recognized over the applicable vesting periods  for share based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of december   as well as compensation cost for new share based awards granted during and we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on their grant dates 
under the black scholes merton option pricing model we estimated volatility using only historical share price performance over the expected life of the option 
results of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts upon adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for restricted awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  sfas no 
r also requires that compensation expense be recognized for only the portion of options and restricted awards that are expected to vest 
therefore  an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee terminations is applied against share based compensation expense 
the forfeiture rate is applied on a straight line basis over the service vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
in addition  upon the adoption of sfas no 
r we began expensing the discount associated with our employee stock purchase plan based on the actual discount received 
property and equipment the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
at december   we had million in goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets related primarily to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurants 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in future impairment of recorded asset balances 
on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurants for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment 
we completed a valuation of the goodwill and intangibles pursuant to sfas no 
as of december   the first day of fiscal  and our valuation showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the cost associated with asset impairments are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings in the financial statement line item impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in operating earnings on a timely basis 
during the year ended december   we incurred charges of approximately million for fiscal in connection with changes in its supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
in addition to the supply chain charges  we also recorded impairment and disposal costs relating to restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during fiscal of approximately million 
included in the million charge is the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants one of which was closed while the other two o charley s restaurants will remain open and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that will remain open 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for three o charley s restaurants  two of which were closed in and one that will be closed and two ninety nine restaurants that will remain open 
we also recorded charges for purchased software that is not longer in use and for asset write offs relating to our project revo lution and dressed to the nines re branding efforts 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and assets sold or otherwise settled that were not held for sale 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for eight o charley s restaurants and a corporate aircraft 
income taxes we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we then must assess the likelihood of successful legal proceedings or reach a settlement  either of which could result in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
under fasb interpretation fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
we are required to perform an analysis and measure each uncertain tax position 
the analysis and measurement requires estimates and interpretations to be made 
we base these estimates upon the best available information at that time of the provision and in coordination with our interpretation of existing tax law 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial performance of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
at december   the company had deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have determined that sfas no 
will not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february   the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have determined that sfas no 
will not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
r retains the underlying concepts of sfas no 
in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but sfas no 
r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r would also apply the provisions of sfas no 
r 
early adoption is not permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact if any  that sfas no 
r may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with earlier adoption prohibited 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
it also amends certain of arb no 
s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas no 
r 
this statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we have not yet determined the impact if any  that sfas no 
may have on our results of operations and financial position 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land construction costs  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
the federal government and several states have instituted or are considering changes to their minimum wage and or benefit related laws which  if and when enacted  could have an adverse impact on our payroll and benefit costs 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we also believe that increased fuel costs over the past months have had a negative impact on consumer behavior and have increased the cost of operating our commissary 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving facility 
at december   we had limited interest rate exposure because there were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility 
accordingly  at december   we did not have any swaps outstanding to manage the interest rate exposure of our credit facility 
at december  and december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to our million senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps is million and is based on six month libor rates in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is percent 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on the notes 
these swap agreements expire in november
