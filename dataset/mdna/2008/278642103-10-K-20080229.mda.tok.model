technology marketplaces and payments our marketplaces and payments platforms utilize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others 
we have developed intuitive user interfaces  customer tools and transaction processing  database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites 
our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data  eases the deployment and operation of large scale global products and services and automates much of the administration of large scale clusters of computers 
our infrastructure has been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences 
we are continually improving our technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency  scalability and security 
for information regarding technology related risks  see the information in item a risk factors under the captions our failure to manage growth could harm our business  and system failures could harm our business

intellectual property we regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we actively pursue the registration of our trademarks  copyrights  patents and domain names in the us and international jurisdictions 
the expansion of our business has required us to protect our trademarks  patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive  may require litigation  and may not be successful in every location 
we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest 
if we are unable to secure our trademarks or domain names  we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered 

table of contents third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we currently are involved in several such legal proceedings 
please see the information in item legal proceedings and in item a risk factors under the captions we are subject to patent litigation and we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately

item a risk factors risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include the following our ability to retain an active user base  attract new users  and encourage existing users to list items for sale  purchase items through our websites  or use our payment service or communication software and products  our ability to increase activity of the users of our marketplaces business  especially with respect to our top buyers and sellers  in our most mature geographies  especially the us  germany and the us  the volume  size  timing  monetization  and completion rates of transactions using our websites or technology  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses  operations  and infrastructure  the effect of recently announced changes to our pricing  products and policies  including our buyer seller feedback features  the effect of recently announced management changes  general economic conditions  including higher inflation  the possibility of a recession in the us and interest rate fluctuations  as well as those economic conditions specific to the internet and ecommerce industries  regulatory and legal actions imposing obligations on our businesses or our users  new laws or regulations  or interpretations of existing laws or regulations  that impose liability on us for actions of our users or otherwise harm our business models or restrict the internet  electronic commerce  online payments  or online communications  the actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new sites  services  and products  consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions using our websites or technology and our ability to manage the costs of our user protection programs  
table of contents our ability to manage paypal s transaction loss rate and payment funding mix  the costs and results of litigation that involves us  our ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we acquire  the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising  and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  our ability to develop product enhancements  programs  and features at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems  infrastructure  and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining operations  technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to us or our users by third parties  our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations  such as credit card associations and banks  our ability to expand paypal s product offerings outside of the us including our ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals  our ability to increase the acceptance of paypal by online merchants outside of our marketplaces platforms  which may require long implementation cycles and incentives to merchants that are initially dilutive  our ability to integrate  manage  and profitably expand and more effectively monetize the skype business  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner and to retain key employees  the continued healthy operation of our technology suppliers and other parties with whom we have commercial relations  continued consumer acceptance of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication in the face of increasing publicity about fraud  spoofing  phishing  viruses  spyware  and other dangers of the internet  and geopolitical events such as war  threat of war  or terrorist actions 
the increased variety of services offered on our websites makes it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we may not maintain our level of profitability or rates of growth 
we believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following attract new users  keep existing users active and reactivate former users on our websites and services  and increase the activity levels of our active users  react to changes in consumer use of the internet and changing customer demands  and develop new services as well as new sources of revenues from our existing services  
table of contents manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with our workforce and with maintaining and enhancing our websites  customer support  transaction loss rate  user protection programs  product development and international expansion  maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers  cost effectively increase the awareness of our brands  and provide our customers with superior community  customer support  and trading  communication  and payment experiences 
we invest heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  and further development of the operating infrastructure for our core and recently acquired operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
growth rates in our most established markets  such as the us  germany and the us  have continued to decline 
despite our efforts to stem these declines  growth rates in these and other markets may continue to decline and may become negative 
as our penetration in established markets grows  we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing users  especially our top buyers and sellers  active and increasing their activity level on our sites for growth 
in addition  our marketplaces business is facing increased competitive pressure 
if we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace  particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed price  new in season items  our business will suffer 
in january  we announced significant changes to our marketplaces business in three major areas fee structure  seller incentives and standards  and feedback  as discussed above under item business 
these changes have been controversial with many of our sellers 
if these changes cause sellers to move their business away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings  our operating results and profitability will be harmed 
in addition  because a large percentage of paypal transactions originate on the ebay platform  declines in growth rates in major marketplaces markets also adversely affect paypal s growth rate 
the growth in skype s user activity has slowed somewhat as skype has increased its focus on monetization of users 
the expected future growth of our paypal  skype  stubhub  shopping 
com  and other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross margins than our marketplaces platforms 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or if exposure reports are delayed 
paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in non us currencies  and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into non us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses  and net income will be negatively impacted if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
net revenues in the fiscal year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
operating income for the fiscal year ended december  was positively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  british pound  australian dollar  and canadian dollar  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this 
table of contents exposure 
in addition  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  and the canadian dollar  cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods by non us purchasers may decrease  and that decrease may not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies 
in addition  we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  reductions in us interest rates may reduce our investment income  which in turn would lower our net interest income 
the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and trade names  or other intellectual property rights 
although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites  some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in asserting their rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us from time to time  including litigation brought by tiffany co 
in the us  rolex us in germany  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france  l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie  and laboratoire garnier cie in several european countries  and a number of other owners of intellectual property rights 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold ebay liable for counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties  for tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our sites by third parties  for the misuse of trademarks in listings or in connection with paid search advertisements  or for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws 
such plaintiffs seek  among other things  injunctive relief and damages 
in the aggregate  these suits could result in significant damage awards and could adversely affect our business 
other luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so 
in addition to litigation from rights owners  we may be subject to criminal penalties if the authorities feel we have aided in the sale of counterfeit goods 
while we have had some early success in defending against such litigation  more recent cases have been based  at least in part  on different legal theories than those of earlier cases  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation 
for example  the german federal supreme court has ruled against us in the rolex and ivd cases 
plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the digital millennium copyright act in the us or as a hosting provider in the european union because of the active nature of our involvement with our sellers  and that  whether or not such safe harbors are available  we should be found liable because we have not adequately removed counterfeit listings or effectively suspended users who have created such listings 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items  such as payment companies 
to the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against paypal based upon the use of paypal s payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items  including on our websites  our business could be harmed 
litigation and negative publicity has increased as our websites gain prominence in markets outside of the us  where the laws may be unsettled or less favorable to us 
such litigation is costly for us  could result in damage awards  injunctive relief  or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  or could otherwise harm our business 
litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs 
in addition  a public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our site could damage our reputation and our business 
we are subject to patent litigation 
we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents 
some of these ongoing suits are described under the heading item legal proceedings  below 
we are a defendant in other patent suits and we have been notified of several other potential patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect that we may face 
table of contents additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and communications segments 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  or could require us to cease conducting certain operations 
use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is often challenged in the us and internationally 
certain goods  such as weapons  adult material  tobacco products  alcohol  and other goods that may be subject to regulation have been listed and traded on our services 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful goods or services or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
in december  an executive of baazee 
com  our indian subsidiary  was arrested in connection with a user s listing of a pornographic video clip on that website 
similarly  our korean subsidiary and one of its employees were found criminally liable for listings on the korean subsidiary s website 
the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to keep prohibited dvds from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty 
although we have prohibited the listing of certain items and implemented other protective measures  in the future  we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings  any of which could harm our business 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods using our services 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand names 
it also could make users reluctant to use our services 
paypal s payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software and other intellectual property  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  and online securities fraud 
recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  including paypal s ability to fine users in certain jurisdictions up to or take legal action to recover its losses for certain violations of paypal s acceptable use policy  including online gambling and illegal sales of prescription medications 
illegal activities could still be funded using paypal 
paypal is subject to anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
although paypal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and regulations  any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits  administrative action  and prosecution by the government 
in july  paypal agreed with the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri that it would pay million as a civil forfeiture to settle allegations that its provision of services to online gambling merchants violated provisions of the usa patriot act and further agreed to have its compliance program reviewed by an independent audit firm 
paypal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
the interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain 
future regulations under the usa patriot act may require paypal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international transactions more closely 
as paypal localizes its service in other countries  additional verification and reporting requirements may apply  which in some cases are more stringent 
several countries  including australia  canada and luxembourg  are in the process of implementing new anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations  and the impact of these laws and regulations on paypal s business is uncertain 
these regulations could impose significant costs on paypal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its network 
paypal could be required to learn more about its customers before opening an account  to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely 
these requirements  as well as any additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations  could raise paypal s costs 
table of contents significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product 
failure to comply with federal  state or foreign country money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties  and forfeiture of significant assets 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these theories have been brought against us 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for content posted in the feedback forum 
several court decisions have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to internet service providers like us under the communications decency act 
this trend  if continued  may increase our potential liability to third parties for the user provided content on our sites 
our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites 
government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about both ebay and paypal  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  from time to time we have been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
paypal has received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  increase educational messaging to users about funding choices  and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures  operating procedures and disclosures 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to enforcement actions  fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
in germany  the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may owe duties  under certain circumstances  to content owners and competitors relating to taking reasonable steps to prevent the listing of 
table of contents illegal  counterfeit  and pirated items 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
failure to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our business 
paypal s highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal 
we believe that several of paypal s current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
while paypal uses advanced anti fraud technologies  we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal s anti fraud systems 
in addition  paypal s service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
merchants could also request reimbursement  or stop using paypal  if they are affected by buyer fraud 
paypal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud  including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant s description 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from buyer fraud  from erroneous transmissions  and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition to the direct costs of such losses  if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive  they could result in paypal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease  in which case our business would further suffer 
paypal was assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks in  and excessive chargebacks may arise in the future 
paypal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
paypal offers a buyer protection program for transactions on ebay 
com that refunds up to  to buyers who used paypal in transactions with selected sellers if the buyer did not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods differed significantly from what was described by the seller and up to in most other ebay transactions 
paypal has expanded this program to many ebay international marketplaces  in most cases with lower reimbursement amounts 
if paypal makes such a refund  it may seek to collect reimbursement from the seller  but may not be able to receive any funds from the seller 
the paypal buyer protection program has increased paypal s loss rate and could cause future fluctuations in paypal s loss rate 
for the full years ended december  and december   paypal s transaction loss including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled million and million  representing and of paypal s net total payment volume  respectively 
ebay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase 
non payment may occur because of miscommunication  because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item  or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or ebay 
in some european jurisdictions  buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period 
while ebay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs 
other than through these programs  ebay does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users  although users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card company or bank  which in turn will seek reimbursement 
table of contents from paypal 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our ebay and paypal services could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users  and diminish the value of our brand names 
we believe that negative user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our services 
any factors which reduce cross border trade could harm our business cross border transactions using our websites generally provide higher gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country due to higher transaction fees we earn for those transactions 
to the extent that any factors  including fluctuations in exchange rates or the application of specific national laws to users in other countries  result in a net reduction in cross border trade  our business could suffer 
our business is subject to online security risks  including security breaches and identity theft 
to succeed  online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not detect or prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
paypal s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data 
in addition  any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user s password could access the user s transaction data 
an increasing number of websites including  recently  our korean subsidiary  have reported breaches of their security 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business  and could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws 
in addition  a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  cause interruption in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
under credit card rules and our contract with our card processors  if there is a breach of credit card information that we store  or that is stored by paypal s direct credit card processing customers  we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses 
in addition  if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards  even if there is no compromise of customer information  we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments or pay their fees 
if we were unable to accept credit cards  our business would be seriously damaged 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches  including any breach that results in the release of our users personal information  could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information or to introduce viruses through trojan horse programs to our users computers 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay  paypal  skype  or a user of one of those businesses  but direct 
table of contents recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program 
despite our efforts to mitigate spoof emails through product improvements and user education  spoof and phishing remain a serious problem that may damage our brand  discourage use of our websites  and increase our costs 
changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially for financial information and for users located outside of the us in many cases  these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries  and other parties with which we have commercial relations 
new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux 
these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications 
complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
in addition  we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal  state or international privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others  subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us 
in addition  as noted above  we are subject to the possibility of security breaches  which themselves may result in a violation of these laws 
our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control 
we derive an increasing portion of our revenues from advertising on our websites 
revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures  such as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer spending  as well as the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative to other websites 
if we experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to economic  competitive or other factors  including if we are unable to provide value to our advertisers  our business and financial results would suffer 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands  and these efforts may be costly 
our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth  and to frequent and high visibility national and local media coverage 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services  and will require an increased focus on active marketing efforts across all of our brands 
the demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing  and may continue to increase 
accordingly  we will need to spend increasing amounts of money on  and devote greater resources to  advertising  marketing  and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users 
since  we have significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting  adding rent 
com  shopping 
com  kijiji  stubhub  and skype  among others 
each of these brands requires its own resources  increasing the costs of our branding efforts 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands 
also  major search engine operators that we use to advertise our brands have frequently changing rules that govern their pricing  availability and placement of online advertisement eg  paid search  keywords  and changes to these rules could negatively affect our use of online advertising to promote our brands 
if we do attract new users to our services  they may not conduct transactions using our services on a regular basis 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  our business would be harmed 

table of contents new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property issues  parallel imports and distribution controls  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act and the european union s directive on distance selling and electronic commerce  are being interpreted by the courts  but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 
furthermore  as our activities and the types of goods and services listed on our websites expand  including through acquisitions such as our acquisition of stubhub  an online ticket marketplace  in february  regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction  either with respect to our services in general  or with respect the sale of certain items  such as real estate  event tickets  cultural goods  boats  and automobiles 
our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to their business to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators  particularly in the us and europe 
these established businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations 
they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services 
in particular  these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing  parallel imports  professional seller obligations  stolen goods  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights  and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues 
success in changing the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third party listings could negatively impact our business 
over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in numerous states and the us congress that would make ebay liable for the sale of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform  including gift cards and health and beauty products 
no such legislation has passed 
nonetheless  the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation  and if any of these laws are adopted it could harm our business 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions  including france  have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users 
attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could harm our business 
in france  we have been sued by conseil des ventes  the french auction regulatory authority 
the agency alleges that sales on our french website constitute illegal auctions which cannot be performed without their consent 
this and other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes could harm our business 
a number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws 
for example  trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder s consent 
the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled outside of the eu  and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations  our business could be harmed 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users  or the location of the product or service being 
table of contents sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction 
laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  competitors  users and other third parties 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings  and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business 
in addition  we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us 
our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services 
if paypal were found to be subject to or in violation of any us laws or regulations governing banking  money transmission  or electronic funds transfers  it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices 
nearly all us states and territories have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses in of these jurisdictions and interpretations in six states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes  and is applying for licenses in two additional states 
the remaining u 
s states and territories do not currently regulate money transmitters 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to bonding requirements  restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
in july  paypal entered into a settlement agreement and agreed to pay  to the california department of financial institutions in connection with alleged violations of the california financial code relating to the use of a receipt form for international payments that had not been pre approved by the department  and incomplete reporting to the department 
if paypal were found to be in violation of other money services laws or regulations  paypal could be subject to liability  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  or forced to change its business practices 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
even if paypal is not forced to change its business practices  it could be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has assumed that its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the federal reserve board 
as a result  among other things  paypal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses above from transactions not authorized by the consumer 
paypal currently voluntarily reimburses consumers for all financial losses from transactions not authorized by the consumer  not just losses above paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants  but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account 
in addition  paypal is subject to the financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  state financial privacy laws  and related regulations 
as a result  some customer financial information that paypal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure 
existing and potential future privacy laws may limit paypal s ability to develop new products and services that make use of data gathered through its service 
the provisions of these laws and related regulations are complicated 
even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to  for each non compliant transaction 
paypal processed an average of approximately million transactions per day during the year ended december   and any violations could expose paypal to significant liability 
any negative change in the public s perception of paypal s compliance with privacy laws and policies could also negatively impact paypal s business 
paypal is subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg  and its status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in markets outside the us is unclear 
paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from markets  and allows its customers to receive payments in of those markets including the us customers can only withdraw funds electronically to local bank accounts in of these markets 
in of these markets customers can withdraw funds electronically to their credit or debit card 
in two of these markets customers can only withdraw funds locally by receiving a bank draft in the mail  and in another two of these markets  customers cannot withdraw locally and can only withdraw funds if they have a us bank account 
these limitations affect paypal s ability to grow in these markets 
paypal also offers customers the ability to send or receive payments denominated in 
table of contents currencies 
of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service  countries plus four french overseas departments are members of the european union 
previously  paypal delivered services in the eu through a subsidiary in the united kingdom licensed to operate as an electronic money institution 
as of july  paypal provides localized versions of its service to customers in the eu through paypal europe sarl et cie  sca  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed as a bank in luxembourg 
accordingly  paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management  corporate governance or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks 
paypal does not have experience in operating as a bank  and any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the luxembourg regulator could adversely affect paypal s business 
paypal europe implements its localized services in eu countries through an expedited passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives  and has completed the passport notice process in all eu member countries 
the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business  in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law 
the regulators in these countries could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office 
any such responses from these regulators could increase the cost of  or delay  paypal s plans for expanding its business 
in markets other than the us  eu  australia and china  paypal serves its customers through paypal singapore private ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is based in singapore 
in many of these markets  it is not clear whether paypal s singapore based service is subject to local law or  if it is subject to local law  whether such local law requires a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
even if paypal is not currently required to obtain a license in those countries  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal s service in those countries could require licensure 
paypal could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its product 
delay or failure to receive such a license would require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal s international expansion plans and could require paypal to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
paypal may also be subject to other laws and regulations of one or more countries in which it serves its customers  such as data protection and anti money laundering laws  which vary from country to country and are subject to change 
in some cases  these laws may require expensive changes to paypal s current business practices 
if paypal were found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations  it could be subject to liability  forced to change its business practices or forced to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
in addition  if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers outside of the us  either alone  through a commercial alliance  or through an acquisition  paypal could become subject to additional licensure requirements  additional laws and regulations  or increased regulatory scrutiny  which could impose substantial costs and delay the introduction of any new products 
changes to credit card networks or bank fees  rules  or practices could harm paypal s business 
paypal does not belong to or directly access credit card networks  such as visa and mastercard 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions  and must pay a fee for this service 
from time to time  credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
paypal s credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing 
these increased fees increase paypal s operating costs and reduce its profit margins 
paypal is also required by its processors to comply with credit card association operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card associations as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypal s customers 
the credit card associations set and interpret the credit card rules 
credit card networks could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and our business would further suffer 

table of contents paypal is required to comply with credit card networks special operating rules for internet payment services 
paypal and its credit card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these rules  but any failure to comply could result in fines  the amount of which would be within the credit card networks discretion 
paypal also could be subject to fines from credit card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk  primarily the sale of certain types of digital content 
for high risk merchants  paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with credit card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants 
paypal has incurred fines from its credit card processor relating to paypal s failure to detect the use of its service by high risk merchants 
the amount of these fines has not been material  but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts  could become material  and could result in a termination of paypal s ability to accept credit cards or changes in paypal s process for registering new customers  which would seriously damage paypal s business 
changes in paypal s funding mix could adversely affect paypal s results 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or use buyer credit issued by ge money bank 
senders fund a significant portion of paypal s payment volume using credit cards  and paypal s financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards 
senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons  including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with their credit card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  the ability to earn frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit card issuers  the ability to defer payment  or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal 
in addition  some of paypal s newer offerings  including the ability to make a limited number of payments without opening an account  have a higher rate of credit card funding than paypal s basic product offering 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
also in september  paypal announced that it had reached a preliminary settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately million into a settlement fund for the benefit of a class represented by plaintiffs in a suit that alleged  among other things  that paypal s disclosure regarding the effects of users choice of funding mechanism was deceptive 
this settlement was rejected by the court 
although paypal did not admit any liability for any of the allegations in the two cases  changes to our disclosure practices could result in increased use of credit card funding  which would harm paypal s business 
paypal s failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its business 
paypal s ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers  paypal has a limited operating history and limited management experience in managing these internal controls 
as paypal s business continues to grow  it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal s success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of paypal s product severely 
system failures could harm our business 
we have experienced system failures from time to time  and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits  could harm our future revenues and profits  and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
our ebay 
com website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours  and our paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days 
in august  skype experienced an interruption during which the majority of skype s users were unable to use its products for approximately two days 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that 
table of contents our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
reliability is particularly critical for paypal  especially as it seeks to expand its merchant services business 
because paypal is a regulated financial entity  frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to fines  penalties  or mandatory changes to paypal s business practices  and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
some of our systems  including our shopping 
com and skype websites  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and our international business  especially in germany and the uk  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
net revenues outside the us accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues in fiscal year and fiscal expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local cultures  standards  and policies 
the commercial  internet  and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our traditional marketplace business model 
in many countries  we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do  and we may not benefit from first to market advantages 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew our ebay marketplace offering from the japanese market  and in we contributed our business in china to a joint venture with a local chinese company 
even if we are successful in developing new markets  we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  including through the expansion of paypal  skype  shopping 
com  and our classified businesses  we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following strong local competitors  regulatory requirements  including regulation of internet services  communications  auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  data protection  banking  and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require product changes  require special licensure  subject us to various taxes  penalties or audits  or limit the transfer of information between ebay and our affiliates  greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less developed with respect to the internet  unique local laws  conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card associations  and electronic fund transfer systems or with the local telecommunications infrastructure  differing levels of retail distribution  shipping  communications  and internet infrastructures  
table of contents different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  challenges associated with joint venture relationships  including dependence on our joint venture partners  difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  online trading  seasonal reductions in business activity  expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses  profit repatriation restrictions  foreign currency exchange restrictions  and exchange rate fluctuations  volatility in a specific country s or region s political  economic or military conditions  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  repatriating money without adverse tax consequences  and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates  above 
in addition  we conduct certain functions  including product development  customer support and other operations  in regions outside the us  particularly in india and china 
we are subject to both us and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities  and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits  including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements  associated with providing these functions outside of the us could adversely affect our business 
we are continuing to expand paypal s services internationally 
in some countries  expansion of paypal s business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks  a shared ownership interest with a local entity or registration as a bank under local law 
such requirements may reduce our profitability or limit the scope of our activities in particular countries 
any limitation on our ability to expand paypal internationally could harm our business 
we maintain a portion of shopping 
com s research and development facilities and personnel in israel  and in january we acquired fraud sciences ltd  an israeli company 
as a result  political  economic and military conditions in israel affect those operations 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain 
increased hostilities or terrorism within israel or armed hostilities between israel and neighboring states could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in israel  which could increase our costs 
in addition  many of our employees in israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances 
our israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military service  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents acquisitions and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties  dilution  and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  including  most recently  fraud sciences ltd 
and stumbleupon 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions 
any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration  particularly given the large number and size and varying scope of our recent acquisitions  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in  or acceleration of  compensation  or changes in management  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management  information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  in the case of foreign acquisitions  the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic  currency  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries  in some cases  the need to transition operations  users  and customers onto our existing platforms  and liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including violations of laws  rules and regulations  commercial disputes  tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions  or may not realize them in the time frame expected 
for example  in connection with the skype transaction  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately billion in our financial statements during future acquisitions or mergers may result in a need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write offs of goodwill  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
in addition  we have made investments in certain joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest  and lack management and operational control 
these investments in joint ventures may involve risks  including the risk that the controlling joint venture partner may have business interests  strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours  and the risk that business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax  or vat  goods and services tax  business tax  and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ebay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or electronic commerce or communications conducted over the internet 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of electronic commerce or communications on the internet 
from time to time  some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes 
the application of existing or future laws could have adverse effects on our business 

table of contents several proposals have been made at the us state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services or communications through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
the us federal government s moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce was extended through november through legislation enacted in october this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and or one of its extensions 
if the moratorium were to expire there could be an adverse effect on our business 
in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing  multi year effort by us  state  and local governments to require collection and remittance of distant sales tax by out of state sellers bills have been introduced in the us congress to overturn the supreme court s quill decision  which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
an overturning of the quill decision without a robust small business exemption would harm our users and our business 
we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services 
one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection or reporting or record keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce 
such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been discussed in the us congress  several states  and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if an ebay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates 
one or more jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction  regardless of where the respective users are located 
imposition of a record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business 
foreign authorities may also require ebay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers  including tax requirements 
in addition  we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites  and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data 
the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers  especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce  and any use of those records to investigate  collect taxes from  or prosecute sellers  could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate 
in most cases  we are entitled to reclaim input vat from the various countries 
however  because of our unique business model  the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain 
a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our business 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebay s obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations 
passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or tax related reporting requirements could harm our users and our business 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which ebay conducts or will conduct business 
the current regulatory environment for voice over internet protocol voip is uncertain  and skype s business could be harmed by new regulations or the application of existing regulations to its products 
the current regulatory environment for voip is uncertain and rapidly changing 
skype s voice communications products are currently subject to few  if any  of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony and voip based telephone replacement services 
voip companies are generally subject to different regulatory regimes in different countries  and in most cases are subject to lower  or no  regulatory fees and lesser  or no  specific regulatory requirements 
regulatory agencies may require skype to conform to rules that are difficult or impossible for it to comply with due to the nature of its communications technologies  which could adversely affect its business 
for example  while suitable alternatives may be developed in the future  skype is currently unable to identify the exact geographic origin of the traffic traversing the internet or to provide detailed calling information about computer to 
table of contents computer communications  either of which may make complying with future regulatory requirements  such as emergency service requirements  difficult or impossible 
governments may impose new or increased fees  taxes  and administrative burdens on voip companies  or skype may change its product offerings in a manner that makes it become subject to telecommunications regulations 
increased fees could include access and other charges payable to local exchange carriers to carry and terminate traffic  contributions to federal or state universal service funds in the united states and elsewhere  and other charges 
in addition  such fees may be assessed by governments retroactively or prospectively 
skype may be required to meet various emergency service requirements  disability access requirements  user protection requirements  number assignment and portability requirements  and interception or wiretapping requirements  such as the communications assistance for law enforcement act in the us and similar laws in other jurisdictions 
such regulations could result in substantial costs depending on the technical changes required to accommodate the requirements  and any increased costs could erode skype s pricing advantage over competing forms of communication 
regulations that decrease the degree of privacy for users of skype s products could also slow its adoption 
the increasing growth and popularity of the voip telephony and internet communications market heighten the risk that governments will seek to regulate voip and internet communications  and skype has received an increasing number of inquiries from regulators about its products and services 
competitors  including the incumbent telephone companies  may devote substantial lobbying efforts to seek greater protection for their existing businesses and increased regulation of voip 
in the united states  various state legislatures and regulatory agencies are beginning to impose their own requirements and taxes on voip 
some countries have prohibited skype 
in many countries in which skype products are available  the laws that may relate to its offerings are unclear 
we cannot be certain that skype or its customers are currently in full compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in all countries in which skype is used 
skype s failure or the failure of those with whom skype transacts business to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  increased regulatory requirements on voip would increase skype s costs  and  as a result  our business would suffer 
new rules and regulations with respect to voip are being considered in various countries around the world  and at least some of these rules and regulations are likely to be adopted and to be applicable to skype 
such new rules and regulations are likely to increase our costs of doing business and could prevent us from delivering our products and offerings over the internet  which could adversely affect skype s customer base  and thus its revenue 
skype depends on key technology that is licensed from third parties 
skype licenses technology underlying certain key components of its software from third parties it does not control  including the technology underlying its peer to peer architecture and firewall traversal technology  and the video compression decompression used to provide high video quality 
although skype has contracts in place with its third party technology providers  there can be no assurance that the licensed technology or other technology that we may seek to license in the future will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  existing licenses could result in a decrease in service quality or loss of service until equivalent technology or suitable alternatives can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated 
while we believe skype has the ability to either extend these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or identify and obtain or develop suitable alternative products  the costs associated with licensing or developing such products could be high 
any failure to maintain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or license or develop alternative technologies would harm skype s business 
our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet 
internet service providers may be able to block  degrade  or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings 
our customers rely on access to the internet to use our products and services 
in many cases that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings  including incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  mobile communications companies  and large internet service providers 
some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade  disrupt  or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their lines for our offerings  by filtering  blocking  delaying  or degrading the packets containing the data associated with our products  or by charging increased fees to us or our 
table of contents users for use of their lines to provide our offerings 
some of these providers have contractually restricted their customers access to voip offerings which would include skype through their terms of service with their customers 
these activities are technically feasible and may be permitted by applicable law 
in addition  internet service providers could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings 
worldwide  a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions 
interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings  whether paid by us or by our customers  could cause us to lose existing customers  impair our ability to attract new customers  and harm our revenue and growth 
our tickets business is subject to regulatory  competitive  and other risks that could harm this business 
our tickets business  which includes our stubhub business  is subject to numerous risks 
many jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets  and some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets 
in addition  new laws and regulations may be passed that would limit our or our users ability to continue this business 
regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions 
some event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our sites 
in november  the new england patriots filed suit against stubhub alleging that stubhub s resale activities violate massachusetts ticket resale laws and constitute intentional interference with the team s relationship with its season ticket holders 
in april  ticketmaster filed suit against ebay d b a stubhub alleging that stubhub had improperly interfered with ticketmaster s contracts with its clients by wrongfully obtaining tickets for sale in violation of ticketmaster s exclusive contractual rights to sell such tickets 
such litigation could result in damage awards  could require us to change our business practices in harmful ways  or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business 
our tickets business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries 
our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources  including ticketing service companies such as ticketmaster and tickets 
com  event organizers such as professional sports teams and leagues  ticket brokers  and other online and offline ticket resellers  such as ticketsnow which has entered into an agreement to be acquired by ticketmaster and razorgator 
if we are unable to effectively compete with these competitors  our tickets business could be harmed 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them 
in january  we announced that meg whitman will be resigning as our president and chief executive officer effective march   and that john donahoe has been named by our board of directors to succeed ms 
whitman as our president and chief executive officer upon ms 
whitman s resignation  as well as other significant changes in our executive management 
these changes may result in increased attrition of our personnel as new reporting relationships are established and as other companies may increasingly target our executives 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and many members of our senior management team have fully vested the vast majority of their in the money equity incentives 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
similarly  decreases in the number of unvested in the money stock options held by existing employees  whether because our stock price has declined  options have vested  
table of contents or because the size of follow on option grants has declined  may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees 
problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business 
a number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  storefronts that help our users list items  caching services that make our sites load faster  and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform  among others 
in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
paypal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the credit card and bank clearing networks 
financial  regulatory  or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on our websites more difficult  and thereby harm our business 
price increases by companies that provide services to our users could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our users to complete transactions  thereby harming our business 
for example  we believe recent changes in postal rates that affected certain lower weight packages and mailings between the us and canada may have reduced listing volume on our sites in certain categories 
any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business 
in addition  we have outsourced certain functions to third party outside providers  including customer support and product development functions  which are critical to our operations 
if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily  our operations could be disrupted  which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business  reputation and operating results 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with third parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future  and there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to our users will continue to do so at reasonable rates or at all 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or anti fraud measures could diminish use of our services 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users 
these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer support requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could significantly impact our profitability 
failure to manage or train our customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
if we do not handle customer complaints effectively  our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence 
because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal  unlike ebay  must provide telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
as part of paypal s program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering  it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer s account activity are identified by paypal s risk models as suspicious 
paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions  and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve account restrictions promptly 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  paypal s users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity  its ability to attract new customers may be damaged  and it could become subject to additional litigation 
as a result  current and future revenues could suffer  and its operating margins may decrease 
in addition  negative publicity about or experiences with customer support for marketplaces  paypal or skype could cause ebay s reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in the ebay brands as a whole 

table of contents our industry is intensely competitive  and other companies or governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is anti competitive 
marketplaces marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low and current offline and new competitors can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful ecommerce companies 
our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount  and general merchandise stores as well as the online operations of these traditional retailers  emerging online retailers  online classified services  and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
these include most prominently wal mart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam s club  amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc  and home shopping network 
a number of companies offer a variety of services that provide channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes  including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake  google base  microsoft live expo  and oodle 
com 
our kijiji websites offers classifieds listings in a variety of local international markets  and in july  kijiji launched local classifieds websites in the us in many markets in which it operates  including in the us  our classified platforms compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms 
in  we acquired shopping 
com ltd  an online shopping comparison site 
shopping 
com competes with sites such as buy 
com  google s product search  nextag 
com  pricegrabber 
com  shopzilla  and yahoo product search  which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
recent legal developments may affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers begin requiring more uniformity in product pricing 
in addition  sellers are increasingly acquiring new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as google and yahoo 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also compete with many local  regional  and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major categories of products offered on our websites 
for example  category specific competitors to offerings in our computers  consumer electronics  and cameras photo categories include abt electronics  amazon 
com  apple  best buy  buy 
com  circuit city  cnet  compusa  computer discount warehouse  dell  electronics boutique  fry s electronics  gamestop  gateway  hewlett packard  lenovo  microwarehouse  overstock 
com  pc connection  pcmall 
com  radio shack  ritz camera  tech depot  tiger direct  tweeter home entertainment  ubid  major wireless carriers  and computer  consumer electronics  and photography retailers our international marketplaces websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online ecommerce sites  such as quelle and otto in germany  yahoo kimo in taiwan  daum and gmarket in south korea  oztion and aussie bidder in australia  and amazon in the united kingdom and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  customer service  and brand recognition 

table of contents with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion  interaction and size  website ease of use and accessibility  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
the adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our websites 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
conversely  other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
such claims  even if without foundation  typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort  and could result in significant judgments against us 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our profitability 
in january  we announced significant changes to our marketplaces business in three major areas fee structure  seller incentives and standards  and feedback while these changes are intended to improve our users buying experience and increase activity on our sites  certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes  which could harm our operating results and profitability 
in addition  certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services  which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay sellers to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our services 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  or search engines  could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict our access  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
search engines may increasingly become a starting point for online shopping  and as the costs of operating an online store decline  online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels  which could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites 

table of contents paypal the market for paypal s product is emerging  intensely competitive  and characterized by rapid technological change 
paypal competes with existing online and offline payment methods  including  among others credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants  including american express  cardservice international  chase paymentech  first data  and wells fargo  and payment gateways  including cybersource and authorize 
net which has merged with cybersource  money remitters such as moneygram and western union  bill payment services  including checkfree  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account  including certegy  paybytouch and telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  or to pay on credit  including bill me later  providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders  and automated clearing house transactions  issuers of stored value targeted at online payments  including visabuxx  netspend and greendot formerly known as next estate  amazon payments  which acts as a credit processor and can be linked to a personal bank account  and google checkout  which enables the online payment of merchants using credit cards 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal s competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
some of these competitors may also be subject to lesser licensing  anti money laundering  and other regulatory requirements than paypal  which is subject to additional regulations based on its licensure as a bank in luxembourg 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
for example  google checkout extended its free payment processing promotion through february   and currently offers free payments processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain advertising spending with google 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
overseas  paypal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods 
in each country  numerous banks provide standard online credit card acquiring and processing services  and these banks typically have leading market share 
in addition  paypal faces competition from visa s visa direct  mastercard s moneysend  royal bank of scotland s world pay and clickandbuy in the eu  nochex  moneybookers  neteller and firepay in the united kingdom  certapay and hyperwallet in canada  paymate and bpay in australia  alipay  yeepay  and bill in china and inicis in south korea 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany and australia  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
some of paypal s competitors  such as wells fargo  first data  american express  and royal bank of scotland  also provide processing or foreign exchange services to paypal 
if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers  either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition  these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be negatively affected  or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for paypal to deliver its services 
skype the market for skype s products is also emerging  intensely competitive  and characterized by rapid technological change 
many traditional telecommunications carriers  internet companies  and cable providers 
table of contents offer  or have indicated that they plan to offer  voip products or services that compete with the software skype provides 
microsoft recently announced the expansion of its office communications suite to include voip 
we expect competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products  software  services  and technologies 
if skype s competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the market for skype s products  increase price competition  or make skype s products obsolete  which could lower skype s adoption rates  decrease its ability to attract new users or cause its current users to migrate to a competing company 
in addition  some of skype s competitors  such as telecommunications carriers and cable television providers  are bundling services and products that skype does not offer 
these include various forms of wireless communications  voice and data services  internet access  and cable television 
this form of bundling may put skype at a competitive disadvantage if these providers can combine a variety of service offerings at a single attractive price 
furthermore  competitors may choose to make their services interoperable with one another  rather than proprietary  which could increase the attractiveness of their services relative to skype and decrease the value of skype s network of users 
many of skype s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources 
some also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than skype has 
as a result of their greater resources  many current and potential competitors may be able to lower their prices substantially  thereby eroding some or all of skype s cost advantage 
our business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites  including seasonal factors  national events and increased usage of other websites 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes 
similarly  our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
in addition  increased usage of social networking or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our failure to manage growth could harm our business 
we have expanded our headcount  facilities  and infrastructure in the us and internationally  and anticipate that further expansion will be required as we continue to expand into new lines of business and geographic areas 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational  and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following website usability 
user activity rates on our websites depend in part on the quality of our users experiences on those sites 
the rapid growth in the number and complexity of products and features on our sites has occasionally caused users to become confused or overwhelmed or has otherwise impaired users experiences on those sites 
we are in the process of making numerous improvements to our ebay websites  including an attempt to improve the user experience on those websites 
these attempts at improvement could fail  or could decrease activity among users who had grown used to or preferred the existing experience on our sites 
any impairment of customer satisfaction as a result of site usability issues could lead to a loss of customers or impair our ability to add customers  either of which would harm our business 
website stability 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce 
this upgrade process is expensive  and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements 
failure to upgrade our technology  features  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our 
table of contents services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible application programming interface  or api  and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems  and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites 
for example  in october  we experienced unscheduled downtime on the paypal website over a period of five days related to system upgrades  and in the second quarter of  paypal experienced an interruption during which many of paypal s services were unavailable for approximately four hours 
in august  skype experienced an interruption to its services during which the majority of skype s users were unable to use its products for approximately two days 
despite our efforts to increase site scalability and reliability  our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions 
some of our more recently acquired businesses may be particularly subject to this risk given their shorter histories and  in some cases  higher growth rates 
any failure to accommodate transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction  lead to a loss of customers  impair our ability to add customers  or increase our costs  all of which would harm our business 
further  steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive  reduce our margins  and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
customer account billing 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue 
customer support 
we are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites and the increased level of user protection activity we provide worldwide 
if we are unable to provide these operations in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  and our operating margins may decrease 
we must continue to effectively hire  train  and manage new employees 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing  and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities 
any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce and communications 
the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
concerns about fraud  privacy  and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet as a medium of commerce 
in countries such as the us and germany  where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our services is high  acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer internet analogs to such traditional retail means to our offerings  such as the 
table of contents retailer s own website 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our trademarks  copyrights  patents  domain names  trade dress  and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a federal  state and common law rights  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  domain name  trade dress  and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our trademarks  patents  and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location 
for example  skype is in the process of applying to register the skype name as a trademark worldwide 
in the eu  skype s application is being opposed 
if these oppositions to skype s applications were to be successful  skype s ability to protect its brand against third party infringers would be compromised 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property  including land and buildings related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the 
table of contents rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item b unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we own and lease various properties in the united states and in other countries around the world 
we use the properties for executive and administrative offices  data centers  product development offices and customer service offices 
as of december   our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage of approximately million and million  respectively 
our corporate headquarters of approximately million square feet are located in san jose  california 
as of december   the total square footage generally used by each of our marketplaces  payments and communications segments was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
from time to time we consider various alternatives related to our long term facilities needs 
while we believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs  it may become necessary to lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth 
item legal proceedings in april  two of our european subsidiaries  ebay gmbh and ebay international ag  were sued by montres rolex sa and certain of its affiliates in the regional court of cologne  germany 
the suit subsequently was transferred to the regional court in d sseldorf  germany 
rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing rolex s trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit rolex watches through our german website 
the suit also alleged unfair competition 
rolex sought an order enjoining the sale of rolex branded watches on the website as well as damages 
in december  a trial was held in the matter  and the court ruled in favor of ebay on all causes of action 
rolex appealed the ruling to the higher regional court of d sseldorf  and the appeal was heard in october in february  the court rejected rolex s appeal and ruled in our favor 
rolex appealed the ruling to the german federal supreme court  a hearing took place before that court in december  and a written decision was issued in june the court s decision found that ebay must take reasonable measures to prevent recurrence once it is informed of clearly identified infringement  and that ebay may in certain circumstances be liable upon first notice of infringement 
the court referred the case back to the higher regional court to determine whether  in some circumstances  a low starting listing price was sufficient to indicate that a listing was infringing 
in july  the german federal supreme court extended the reach of the rolex decision in ivd v 
ebay 
the court held that i in certain circumstances  a duty of care could be found to exist to competitors requiring ebay to take reasonable measures to prevent illegal items from being listed even where the competitors were not directly harmed and ii such duty would extend to listings by the same seller in the same category not just identical listings 
prior to these decisions  we had implemented proactive measures to find and remove illegal listings from our websites  these decisions may require us to undertake further efforts and will subject us to liability if our efforts are deemed to be insufficient 
we expect that this ruling will likely result in increased costs and litigation against us in germany although we do not currently believe that it will require a major change in our business practices 
in august  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture filed two lawsuits in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
the complaint alleges that we violated french tort law by negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks  and by purchasing certain advertising keywords 
the plaintiffs seek approximately eur million in damages 

table of contents around september  parfums christian dior  kenzo parfums  parfums givenchy  and guerlain soci t also filed a lawsuit in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
the complaint alleges that we have interfered with the selective distribution network the plaintiffs established in france and the european union by allowing third parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our websites 
the plaintiffs in this suit seek approximately eur million in damages and injunctive relief 
we filed our initial briefs responding to the first complaint in february  and initial briefs in response to the second complaint were filed in april we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
other luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so  seeking to hold us liable for counterfeit items listed on our websites by third parties  for tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our websites by third parties  for the misuse of trademarks in listings  for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws  for non compliance of consumer protection laws or in connection with paid search advertisements 
in september  mercexchange llc filed a complaint against us  our half

cv alleging infringement of three patents relating to online consignment auction technology  multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems and seeking a permanent injunction and damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
following a trial in  the jury returned a verdict finding that we had willfully infringed the patents relating to multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems  and the court entered judgment for mercexchange in the amount of approximately million  plus pre judgment interest and post judgment interest 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit later reduced the award to million 
in may  following appeals to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit and the us supreme court  the supreme court remanded the case back to the district court for further action 
in parallel with the federal court proceedings  at our request  the us patent and trademark office agreed to reexamine each of the patents in the suit  finding that substantial questions existed regarding the validity of the claims contained in them 
in separate actions in  the patent and trademark office initially rejected all of the claims contained in the three patents in suit 
in september  the patent and trademark office tentatively approved some of the claims and rejected others contained in the patent that underlies the jury verdict  which relates to electronic consignment systems 
we requested that the district court stay all proceedings in the case pending the final outcome of the reexamination proceedings  and mercexchange has renewed its request that the district court grant an injunction 
in july  the court denied mercexchange s request for an injunction and ruled that the proceedings related to one of the patents will be stayed and another of the patents will not be stayed pending action by the patent and trademark office 
mercexchange appealed the court s order denying the injunction  and we filed a motion seeking that the court find the non stayed patent invalid 
in december  the district court ruled that it could not consider ebay s motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial  because it viewed the verdict for mercexchange amounting to approximately million  plus interest as final  subject to an accounting 
we have appealed that ruling 
with the appeals pending  in february  the parties agreed to settle to dismiss all claims and appeals stemming from the lawsuit 
as a part of the settlement  ebay will purchase all three patents involved in the lawsuit  and related technology and inventions  as well as a license to another search related patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit 
these assets will allow ebay to further enhance its operations and trust and safety effort on its ecommerce sites 
the reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect our liability as of december  in connection with this settlement

we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we are subject to additional patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect that we may face additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and communications businesses 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts  and as we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
we believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us  especially in europe 
intellectual property claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources

table of contents you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview our business we operate three primary business segments marketplaces  payments and communications 
our marketplaces segment provides the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety of platforms  including the traditional ebay 
com platform  and our other online platforms  such as shopping 
com  stubhub  classifieds  half 
com and rent 
com 
our payments segment  which consists of paypal  enables individuals or businesses to securely  easily and quickly send and receive payments online 
our communications segment  which consists of skype  enables voip calls between skype users and provides low cost connectivity to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones 
we generate revenues from our marketplaces segment primarily from listing  feature and final value fees paid by sellers and lead referral fees 
for our payments segment  revenues are generated primarily by fees from payment processing services 
our communications segment primarily generates revenues from fees charged to users to connect them from skype s voip network to traditional telecommunication networks 
these fees are charged on a per minute basis and we refer to these minutes as skypeout minutes 
revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of advertisements and from revenue sharing arrangements 
other revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay and paypal users and interest earned from banks on certain paypal customer account balances 
revenues are attributed to us and international geographies based upon the country in which  as the case may be  the seller  payment recipient  skype user s internet protocol address  online property that generates advertising  or other service provider  is located 
because we generate the majority of our revenue internationally  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the results of our operations 
key operating metrics and financial information members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as active users  listings  gross merchandise volume gmv  net total payment volume tpv  transaction loss rates  registered users and skypeout minutes 
members of our senior management team also regularly review key financial information including net revenues  operating margins  earnings per share  cash flows and financial metrics that exclude certain non cash items 
these financial measures allow us to monitor the profitability of our business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of marketing  product development  international expansion  customer support and site operations 
we believe that an understanding of these key operating and financial measures and how they change over time is important to investors  analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities 
financial summary during  our combined businesses generated net revenues totaling billion  representing a billion  or  year over year increase  with each of our segments achieving double digit growth 
overall  our operations were favorably impacted by the weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  the geographic mix of taxable income  a tax benefit from a favorable ruling issued by a tax authority and more efficient use of our resources as demonstrated by reducing our sales and marketing  product development  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
furthermore  our operating results were negatively impacted by the billion impairment charge related to skype goodwill 
revenue generated by our marketplaces segment increased in as compared to as our core business generated billion in gmv in  representing a increase over the prior year 
revenue growth was primarily driven by stubhub acquired in february  advertising  and the fixed price format on ebay 
our 
table of contents marketplaces segment represents approximately of our total net revenues and continues to drive the majority of our consolidated net revenue increase in dollars 
revenue generated by our payments segment  paypal  increased in as compared to paypal represents approximately of our total net revenue and generated net tpv of billion in  a increase over the billion generated in paypal continued to be a popular payment vehicle on various marketplaces platforms 
revenue derived from our merchant services business increased by approximately in compared to and represented approximately of net tpv in compared to in revenue generated by our communications segment  skype  increased in as compared to revenue growth at skype was due primarily to the growth in skypeout minutes driven by our expanding user base and the broadening of our product offerings and various strategic relationships 
skype represents approximately of our total net revenue 
our operating margin was in  which reflected the significant impact of the goodwill impairment charge related to skype of billion  which represented of net revenues 
in  our operating margin was 
our diluted earnings per share was in the goodwill impairment charge related to skype of billion reduced our diluted earnings per share by 
in our diluted earnings per share was we generated operating cash flow of billion in  which allowed us to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately billion 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately billion 
we expect that our business will continue to grow  however  our growth rate has declined over time and we expect that to continue in  primarily as a result of the following we face challenges in the us  us and germany  which are our three largest markets  as growth of listings  active users and gmv on the ebay 
com platform in those countries has slowed 
in january  we announced our plan to implement changes to our fee structure  seller incentives and standards and feedback system  all of which may impact our marketplaces revenue growth  consumer spending in our major markets  including the us  germany and the uk  is expected to be weaker in  and we anticipate that ecommerce growth as a whole will decelerate in we believe that our operating margin percentage will be impacted negatively by the growth of our lower gross margin businesses  primarily paypal and skype  which are growing faster than our marketplaces business and investment in buyer and seller initiatives  and may be affected by the other changes mentioned above 
to partially offset this trend  we intend to continue to improve operating productivity to keep our operating expenses growing at a slower pace than revenue 
we announced another stock repurchase program in january for billion  giving us the ability to repurchase up to billion of our common stock under our combined stock repurchase programs 
any repurchases of our common stock under our combined stock repurchase programs may impact our liquidity 
in addition to the above  to the extent that the us dollar fluctuates against foreign currencies  particularly the euro  british pound  korean won and australian dollar  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars will impact our consolidated net revenues and  to the extent that they are not hedged successfully  our net income

based on changes in foreign currency rates year over year  marketplaces net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately million  million and million in  and respectively 
changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and  to the extent that the us dollar strengthens  our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted 
in  we expect marketplaces net transaction revenues to continue to increase  driven by increased levels of gmv and continued growth from our non gmv based businesses 
in january  we announced changes to our fee structure  as well as changes to our seller incentives and standards and feedback system  on the marketplaces platforms in an effort to increase user activity  particularly in our three largest markets  the us  us and germany 
the reaction of our community of buyers and sellers to these changes  as well as the other factors discussed above under financial summary could impact our revenue growth and may affect future trends

however  general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of net revenues due to increased efficiency in our general and administrative functions  which we expect will be partially offset by investments in our consumer protection programs 
amortization of acquired intangible assets in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenues from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue the purchase of  assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion  increase the features  functions  and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online ecommerce  payments and communications 
these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods 
we amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit  using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years 
the increase in amortization of acquired amortizable intangibles during and compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during  and amortization of acquired intangible assets will increase as we make additional acquisitions in the future

as a result of this test  we concluded that the carrying amount of our communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment loss of approximately billion including a million payment related to the earn out settlement agreement with certain former shareholders of skype during the year ended december  the impairment resulted from an updated long term financial outlook for the skype business developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during our third quarter 
our estimates of future operating results for our communications reporting unit are for an early stage business with limited financial history  as well as developing revenue models 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of the communications reporting unit

our effective tax rate in was  compared to in the increase was due to the goodwill impairment charge with respect to our communications reporting unit which is non deductible for tax purposes  partially offset by a tax benefit from a ruling issued by a tax authority related to prior periods 
the lower effective tax rates in as compared to resulted primarily from the expansion of our international businesses and from changes in our operations in international markets

the net cash flows provided by financing activities in were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
prior to  we had not repurchased our common stock under a stock repurchase program 
our future cash flows from equity awards are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price  the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise equity awards 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels 
in july  our board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock within two years from the date of authorization 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of billion

share repurchases under our repurchase programs may take a variety of forms  including structured stock repurchase programs and other derivative transactions

the amendment agreement increased the lender commitments and borrowing capacity under the credit agreement from its prior level of billion to billion  maintained an option to increase borrowing capacity by an additional billion after giving effect to the billion increase described above and extended the maturity date by an additional year to november  as of december   billion was available under the credit agreement 

table of contents we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately billion  together with cash generated from operations and cash available through our credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  contractual cancellation provisions  fluctuating interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands operating purchase payments due by year ending december  leases obligations total thereafter operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 
purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services  construction contracts and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
the table above does not include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such fin liabilities  the table does not include million of such non current liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
customer funds held by paypal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these funds include funds on behalf of us customers that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation and funds that us customers choose to invest in the paypal money market fund  which totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the paypal money market fund is invested in a portfolio managed by barclays global fund advisors 

table of contents indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business  we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  which are indemnities mainly related to various intellectual property rights 
in our paypal business  we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal or paypal customers 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized credits we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience  are monitored monthly  and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense  while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  net revenues provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a of net revenues historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in 
table of contents an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for doubtful accounts and related authorized credits income from operations net income diluted earnings per share provision for transaction losses our payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of and credit losses from sellers who accept payment through paypal 
we establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions  such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of goods or services  automated clearing house ach returns  buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts 
these allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date  including those of which we have not yet been notified 
the allowances  which involve the use of actuarial techniques  are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors 
the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 
the provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income 
at december   the allowance for paypal transaction losses totaled million 
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of net tpv from paypal operations for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  total payment volume transaction loss expense as a of total payment volume determining appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
based on our results for the year ended december   a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points transaction loss expense income from operations net income diluted earnings per share 
table of contents legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income or against additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent any tax benefits would have otherwise been allocated to equity 
our us businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements  and we expect that profits earned outside the us will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion 
accordingly  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 
the following table illustrates the effective tax rates for   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

table of contents based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share we adopted the provisions of fin as of the beginning of prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  fin permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgement  is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
advertising and other revenues a portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other services 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay and paypal users and interest earned from banks on certain paypal customer account balances 
advertising and other net revenues  including barter transactions  totaled of our consolidated net revenues for and in and  and were primarily generated by our marketplaces segment 
revenue from barter arrangements totaled million in and million in revenue from barter arrangements was not significant in certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition  including  but not limited to  the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements  the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and  for barter transactions  the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values 
we evaluate whether payments made to customers or revenues earned from vendors have a separate identifiable benefit and whether they are fairly valued in determining the appropriate classification of the related revenues and expense 
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount 
table of contents rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models  which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units  particularly  our communications reporting unit 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this test  we concluded that the carrying amount of our communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment loss of approximately billion during the year ended december  the impairment charge includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment with certain former shareholders of skype and was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill in our communications reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill 
see note business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details 
there was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in and stock based compensation on january   we adopted fas r  which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards 
stock based compensation expense recognized for and was million and million  respectively 
for  stock based compensation expense of million was recognized under previous accounting standards 
see note benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information 
we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during and was and per share  respectively  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years years dividend yield expected volatility our computation of expected volatility for and was based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our stock 
prior to  our computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility 
our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
fas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and  accordingly  
table of contents does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however on december   the fasb issued a proposed staff position that would delay the effective date of fas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of fas will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 fas which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we do not believe that the adoption of fas will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as the goodwill acquired 
significant changes from current practice resulting from fas r include the expansion of the definitions of a business and a business combination 
for all business combinations whether partial  full or step acquisitions  the acquirer will record of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill  generally at their fair values  contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and  for certain arrangements  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement  and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
fas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is a third party ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  fas requires consolidated statement of operations to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
fas also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
fas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that 
table of contents have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of one month 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our total fixed income investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value and represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio  the majority of which were held in bank deposits 
we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity instruments and equity method investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments 
we did not record an impairment charge during the years ended december   or relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments 
at december   the total fair value of our equity instruments and equity method investments was million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio 
as of january   the value of an equity instrument had diminished by approximately million due to fluctuations in market value 
foreign currency exposures we are a growing company  with an increasing proportion of our operations conducted outside the us our foreign currency exposure continues to evolve as we grow internationally 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 
international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  certain foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound and korean won  as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
in addition  at december   we held balances in cash and cash equivalents outside the us totaling approximately billion 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation transaction exposure around the world  we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
the hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income 

table of contents economic exposure we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to foreign currency risk 
in addition  we charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and by paypal 
these charges are denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure 
we purchase foreign exchange contracts  generally with maturities of months or less  to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
pursuant to financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
accordingly  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
during the years ended december   and  the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
the notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the loss  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  and was not significant 
we did not have any economic hedges in place as of december  translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income  net 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended december   was a net translation gain of approximately million 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated statement of income 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our consolidated net revenues and operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to the prior year 
we consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation fas 
such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using either exchange contracts or other instruments 
all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed 
during the year ended december   the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  british pound and korean won in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to operating income of approximately million 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income
