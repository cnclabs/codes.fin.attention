item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of approximately american eagle stores in the united states and canada  approximately aerie stand alone stores and approximately martin osa stores in the united states during fiscal  the selection of approximately to american eagle stores in the united states for remodeling during fiscal  the online launch of our new children s apparel brand  kids by american eagle during fiscal with the opening of us stores expected during  the completion of improvements and expansion at our distribution centers  the success of martin osa and martinandosa 
com  
table of contents the success of aerie by american eagle and aerie 
com  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing additional new brands  and the possibility that future auctions of our ars holdings will not be successful and that we may be required to take impairment charges relating to our ars investments 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
during fiscal  we discontinued assessing a service fee on inactive gift cards 
as a result  we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
during fiscal  we reviewed our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and determined that shipping and handling amounts billed to customers  which were historically recorded as a reduction to cost of sales  should be recorded as revenue 
accordingly  these amounts are recorded within net sales 
prior year amounts were reclassified for comparative purposes 
during the three months ended october   we began recording sell offs of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise on a gross basis  with proceeds and cost of sell offs recorded in net sales and cost of sales  respectively 
historically  we presented the proceeds and cost of sell offs on a net basis within cost of sales 
amounts for prior periods were not adjusted to reflect this change as the amounts were deemed to be immaterial 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 

table of contents we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value 
if the future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the asset value to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
we record an investment impairment charge at the point we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we review information about the underlying investment that is publicly available  analyst reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information  and assess our ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
any other than temporary impairment charge could materially affect our results of operations 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
we calculate a weighted average expected term using the simplified method as permitted by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab no 

the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting term and original contractual term of the options 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
effective february   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under fin  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of fin 
table of contents we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits may materially impact our effective tax rate 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
although we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used  if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions  the balances of the deferred tax assets  liabilities and valuation allowance as well as net income could be adversely affected 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses  and our level of capital expenditures 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 

table of contents cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
results of operations overview fiscal marked another record year of financial performance for american eagle outfitters 
we managed the business with discipline  achieving a operating margin  while continuing to invest in critical growth initiatives 
our results were driven by our strong customer connection  well positioned brands  leading operations and technology  as well as the talent within our teams 
net sales for fiscal increased to billion  and consolidated comparable store sales increased compared to the corresponding week period last year 
our comparable store sales increase was driven by a combination of higher units per transaction and a higher average unit retail price resulting in a higher transaction value 
operating income as a percent to net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease was driven by a decline in gross profit and increased depreciation and amortization expense 
this was partially offset by an improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent to net sales 
for fiscal  net income increased to a record million 
as a percent to net sales  net income decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal net income per diluted share increased to from per diluted share last year

table of contents comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales increased to billion from billion 
the sales increase resulted primarily from an increase in gross square feet due to new and remodeled stores  an increase in sales from our e commerce operation  as well as a increase in comparable store sales 
during the year  our ae brand experienced a low single digit increase in average transaction value  driven by a low single digit increase in units per transaction and a slight increase in average unit retail price 
comparable store sales increased in the high single digits in the men s business and declined in the low single digits in the women s business over last year 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion from billion in fiscal gross margin as a percent to net sales decreased by basis points to from last year 
the percentage decrease was attributed to a basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and a basis point increase in buying  occupancy and warehousing costs as a percent to net sales 
merchandise margin decreased for the period due primarily to increased markdowns and merchandise sell offs partially offset by lower product costs 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding merchandise sell offs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased basis points as a percent to net sales primarily due to higher rent  as well as delivery costs related to our aeo direct business 
share based payment expense included in gross profit increased to approximately million compared to million last year 
our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other retailers  as some retailers include all costs related to their distribution network  as well as design costs in cost of sales 
other retailers may exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales  including them in a line item such as selling  general and administrative expenses

these increases are primarily due to a greater property and equipment base driven by our level of capital expenditures 
other income  net other income  net decreased to million from million 
the decrease was primarily due to a million realized capital gain last year and a decrease in our gift card service fee revenue due to the gift card program change that occurred in july these decreases were partially offset by increased investment income resulting from an overall increase in rates compared to last year

our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands and the possibility of acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 
the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity february  february  working capital in s current ratio our current ratio increased to as of february  from last year due primarily to a decrease in accrued income and other taxes as well as a decrease in accounts payable 
accrued income and other taxes decreased in comparison to last year primarily due to the timing of income tax payments

additionally  while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs  it could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price  resulting in lower sales and profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year

comparatively  if our current portfolio average yield rate decreased by in fiscal  our income before taxes would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our cash  short term and long term investment balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall investments that could happen in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments structure 
foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our canadian operations where the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe our foreign currency translation risk is minimal as a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign exchange rate would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows
