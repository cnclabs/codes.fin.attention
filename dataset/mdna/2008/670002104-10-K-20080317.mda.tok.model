overview novavax  inc  a delaware corporation novavax or the company  was incorporated in  and is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that leverage the company s proprietary virus like particle vlp technology 
vlps imitate the three dimensional structures of viruses but are composed of recombinant proteins and therefore  are believed incapable of causing infection and disease 
our proprietary production technology uses insect cells rather than chicken or mammalian eggs 
the company s current product targets include vaccines against the hn  hn and other subtypes of avian influenza with pandemic potential  human seasonal influenza  varicella zoster  which causes shingles and a fourth undisclosed disease target 
on july   the company began phase i iia clinical trials for its hn pandemic influenza vaccine 
in december  the company announced favorable interim results for its pandemic influenza vaccine that demonstrated immunogenicity and safety 
the company plans to begin patient enrollment in the second portion of the phase i iia trial before march  to gather additional patient immunogenicity and safety data  as well as determining a final dose through completion of this clinical trial 
it is anticipated that initial immunogenicity and safety data will be available early in the third quarter of with study completion by the end of to include on going safety data collection 
the company also has a drug delivery platform based on its micellar nanoparticle mnp technology  proprietary oil and water nano emulsions used for the topical delivery of drugs 
the mnp technology was the basis for the development of the company s first food and drug administration fda approved estrogen replacement product known as estrasorb 
in february  the company sold assets related to estrasorb in the united states  canada and mexico to graceway pharmaceuticals  llc graceway 
the company is seeking to divest its non vaccine mnp technology through sales and licenses 
the company s vaccine products currently under development or in clinical trials will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive pre clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will be successful or that any potential products will prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials 
even if developed  these vaccine products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit the company to operate profitably 
the commercial launch of any vaccine product is subject to certain risks including  but not limited to  manufacturing scale up and market acceptance 
no assurance can be given that the company can generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable or generate positive cash flow from operations at all or on a sustained basis 
the company s efforts to divest the mnp technology may not be successful because the company may not be able to identify a potential licensee or buyer and  even if the company does identify a licensee or buyer  the price and terms may not be acceptable to the company 
summary of significant transactions graceway agreements in february  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with graceway pharmaceuticals  llc graceway  pursuant to which novavax sold graceway its assets related to estrasorb in the united states  canada and mexico

sublease agreement with puricore  inc in april  we entered into a sublease agreement with sterilox technologies  inc now known as puricore  inc 
to sublease  square feet of the company s malvern  pennsylvania corporate headquarters at a premium price per square foot 
the sublease  with a commencement date of july   expires on september  this sublease is consistent with our strategic focus to increase our presence in rockville  maryland  where our vaccine operations are currently located 
in line with that strategy  in october  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet in rockville  maryland 
accordingly  in october  the company entered into an amendment to the sublease agreement with puricore  inc to sublease an additional  square feet of the malvern corporate headquarters at a premium price per square foot 
this amendment has a commencement date of october  and expires concurrent with the initial lease on september  convertible notes on june   we entered into amendment agreements the amendments with each of the holders of the outstanding senior convertible notes the notes to amend the terms of the notes 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the notes 
the amendments i lowered the conversion price from to per share  ii eliminated the holders right to require the company to redeem the notes if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is less than the conversion price on of the consecutive trading days preceding july  or july  and iii mandated that the notes be converted into company common stock if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is greater than a decrease from in any out of consecutive trading days after july  notes with former directors in march  pursuant to the novavax  inc stock option plan  we approved the payment of the exercise price of

as of december   the company has reserved an amount of  for the outstanding note receivables 
this amount has been netted against the pledged common stock 
due to heightened sensitivity in the current environment surrounding related party transactions and the extensions of the maturity dates  these transactions could be viewed negatively in the market and our stock price could be negatively affected 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition and allowances the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

for product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company establishes allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  rebates and charge backs based on historical trends and specifically identified problem accounts 
a large part of the company s product sales are to allergan or to distributors who resell the products to their customers 
the company provides rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from the company s distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between the company and the customer  and to state agencies that administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
the company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of revenue when the company records the sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and adjusts recorded reserves for changes in trends  distributor inventory levels  product prescription data and generic competition 
the shipping and handling costs the company incurs are included in cost of products sold in its statements of operations 
for upfront payments and licensing fees related to contract research or technology  the company follows the provisions of sab no 
in determining if these payments and fees represent the culmination of a separate earnings process or if they should be deferred and recognized as revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenue earned under research contracts is recognized in accordance with the terms and conditions of such contracts for reimbursement of costs incurred and defined milestones 
sfas no 
r as of january  effective date  we adopted sfas no 
r in accounting for stock options issued to our employees  directors and consultants using the modified prospective method 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation costs be recognized for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted prior to the effective date that are unvested using the requirements of sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

apb no 
generally did not require that options granted to employees be expensed 
since we elected to use the modified prospective method  there are no one time effects from the adoption of sfas no 
r  such as a cumulative effect adjustment 
there were no modifications to outstanding stock options as of december  and there have been no changes in the quantity or type of instruments used in share based payment programs 
there has been no material modifications to the valuation methodologies or assumptions from those used in estimating the fair value of options under sfas no 
other than the adjustments for expected volatility 
prior to the adoption of sfas 
no 
r  we utilized the preceding month period historical stock prices in determining the expected volatility 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we use the historical volatilities based on stock prices since the inception of the stock plans in determining the expected volatility 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical activities since the inception of the stock plans 
there have been no changes in the normal terms of share based payment agreements 
for grants awarded prior to january   we accounted for compensation cost using a graded method 
for grants awarded on or after january   we accounted for compensation cost using a straight line method 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the remaining compensation cost of unvested options  as determined using a black scholes option valuation model  was approximately  net of estimated forfeitures 
this remaining compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the company recorded compensation costs in the consolidated statements of operations associated with sfas no 
as follows years ended december  in thousands cost of products sold which includes idle capacity research and development general and administrative total effect of adopting sfas no 
r research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
such costs include internal research and development expenditures such as salaries and benefits  raw materials and supplies and contracted services such as sponsored research  consulting and testing services of proprietary research and development activities and similar expenses associated with collaborative research agreements 
income taxes the company s income taxes are accounted for using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carry forward 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of december  and goodwill and intangible assets goodwill originally results from business acquisitions 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
other intangible assets are a result of product acquisitions  non compete arrangements and internally discovered patents 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis that includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company initially tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
the company thereafter performed the required annual impairment test as of december of each year on the carrying amount of its goodwill 
disposal of long lived assets discontinued operations we account for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 
sfas no 
also provides accounting and reporting provisions for components of an entity that are classified as discontinued operations 
we recorded an impairment loss in connection with the discontinued operations of its philadelphia  pennsylvania manufacturing facility for the year ended december  see note discontinued operations

fin applies to fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded million in uncertain tax positions 
the million of unrecognized tax benefits was accounted for as a million reduction to the january  balance of deferred tax assets and a corresponding million dollar reduction of the valuation allowances 
therefore  we did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized it would affect our annual effective income tax rate 
we and our subsidiary file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states 
we had tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are subject to examination for a number of years beyond the year in which they are utilized for tax purposes 
since a portion of these carryforwards may be utilized in the future  many of these attribute carryforwards may remain subject to examination 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of january  and december   we had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters

the decrease in revenues during as compared to was principally due to the discontinued sale of gynodiol in which after reserves for sale returns netted total revenue of negative  net product sales in were million consisting primarily of gynodiol 
the increase in contract research revenues in as compared to was primarily due to higher government reimbursement for projects and milestones achieved in the increase in royalties and milestone payments in of  as compared to was primarily due to additional fees in of  for a development project and additional royalties from a prior sales agreement 
revenues for consisted of product sales of million compared to million in  contract research and development revenues of million in compared to million in  and royalties  milestone and licensing fees of  in compared to million in total revenues for were million as compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the primary reason for this decrease in revenues was the divestiture of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products to pharmelle  llc in september contract research and development revenues for totaled million as compared to contract research and development revenues of million 
revenues in were recognized under a national institutes of health nih grant to develop a second generation hiv aids vaccine  three manufacturing contracts and one additional government contract

this represents a million decrease from million in royalties  milestones and license fees for which consisted of a million renewal fee received from igi  inc igi in december in accordance with an option in a licensing agreement signed between the company and igi in december this payment gave igi a ten year renewal on licensed technologies in specific fields 
operating costs and expenses change from change from operating costs and expenses cost of products sold research and development selling  general and administrative facility exit costs gain on sales of product assets cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was entirely due to lower gross sales of gynodiol due to the discontinued sale of the product during the third quarter of cost of products sold decreased to  in compared to  in the decrease was due to the divestiture of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products to pharmelle  llc in september  and lower gynodiol sales in when compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses research and development costs increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses were significantly higher in due to increases in personnel  facility and outside testing costs including sponsored research and consulting agreements associated with expanded preclinical testing and process development  manufacturing and quality related programs  license fees paid to wyeth holdings corporation and the initiation of human clinical trials necessary to advance our influenza vaccine candidates in clinical development 
research and development costs increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was due primarily to higher research and development spending to support our strategic focus on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that leverage the company s proprietary vlp technology 
research and development expenses were significantly higher in due to increases in personnel  facility and outside testing costs including sponsored research and consulting agreements associated with expanded preclinical testing and process development  manufacturing and quality related programs necessary to move the company s influenza vaccine candidates into pre clinical testing 
also contributing to this increase was the recognition of million of non cash compensation costs resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
r in  using the modified prospective method  while no costs were recorded in utilizing the accounting recognition methods under apb no 
estimated cost and time to complete major projects the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   our proprietary product and vaccine candidates were in early stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of product development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for those product candidates 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  but not limited to  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products and vaccines in numerous preclinical studies to evaluate potential immune response  safety and toxicology in animals 
we may conduct multiple human clinical trials to cover multiple indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above and other risks and uncertainties  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue pursuing our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risks and uncertainties and our liquidity  see item a risk factors and see liquidity and capital resources 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to increased facility costs of approximately million for the company s new facility in rockville  maryland which was leased in the fourth quarter of  million increase for reserves for loans to former board of directors based on the value of the common stock of novavax held for collateral and increased employee and related costs of million 
selling  general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the decrease in these expenses of million was due to the discontinuation of the sales force in  resulting from the sale of estrasorb to esprit pharma in late  and a corresponding reduction of million in selling expenses 
the savings in selling expenses was partially offset by an increase of million of non cash compensation costs resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
r in  using the modified prospective method  while no costs were recorded in utilizing the accounting recognition methods under apb no 
in addition  other factors contributing to partial offset were higher personnel  legal and consulting costs related to the company s vlp based vaccine development programs 
the company took steps to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio and initiate business development and commercial assessment activities related to its new vaccine development strategy 
also included in is a  reserve against a note receivable and its corresponding accrued interest due from a former director of the company
