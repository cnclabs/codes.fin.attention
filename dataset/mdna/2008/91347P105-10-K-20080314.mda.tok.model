item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in section a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  technology development and evaluation agreements and license fees and royalties 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our oled technologies and materials become more widely adopted by product manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenue represents reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we also receive non refundable advance license and royalty payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees  which represents the cash received and recorded as a liability until such time revenue can be recognized 
payments that are not creditable to a license are recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
payments that are creditable to a license are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
upfront amounts received where a license agreement has not yet been executed are recorded as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
if a license agreement is executed  these payments would be recorded as revenues over the expected term of the licensed technology and the associated deferred revenue for the upfront payment would be classified based on the terms of the license  otherwise  they will be recorded as revenues at the time negotiations with the other party show that there is no appreciable likelihood of entering into a license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the expected term of this licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue and deferred license fees  of which  has been received where a license agreement has not yet been executed 
valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or the net book value of our acquired technology was  as of december  valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
the statement eliminates the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  that we used prior to we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force eitf 
sfas no 
r and eitf require that we record an expense for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of recording charge to the statement of operations required by sfas no 
r 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of  and an increase in operating expenses of  the increase in operating loss was offset to some extent by an increase of  in interest income 
the decrease in net loss per diluted share  despite the increase in total net loss  resulted from an increase in the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding in  as compared to our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was mainly due to a decrease in development chemical revenue of  a decrease in royalty and license revenue of  and a decrease in technology development revenue of  these decreases were offset by the following an increase in contract research revenue of  and an increase in commercial chemical revenue of  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government for  compared to  for the increase was mainly attributable to increased work performed under government contracts and the achievement of milestones as specified within government contracts 
we commenced work on new government contracts during and completed work on eight government programs during the year 
we earned  from our sales of oled materials for development purposes in  compared to  in the decrease was mainly due to decreased volume of development chemical purchases as a result of an oled product manufacturer transitioning from exclusively development chemical purchases in to primarily commercial chemical purchases in we cannot accurately predict the timing and frequency of development chemical purchases by our customers due to participants in the oled industry having differing oled technology development and product launch strategies  which are subject to change and adjustment 
for  our commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in the increase in commercial chemical revenue was due to increased purchases of our proprietary pholed materials for use in commercial oled products  including by the oled product manufacturers referred to above 
in the fourth quarter of  we began supplying our proprietary pholed materials to samsung sdi for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
this activity continued in  with samsung sdi being responsible for the vast majority of our commercial chemical sales for the year 
as discussed further below  in we also began recognizing royalty and license revenue from samsung sdi on account of its sales of commercial oled products made using our proprietary pholed technology and materials 
in  we also began supplying our proprietary pholed materials to chi mei el and lg display  with whom we signed commercial supply agreements during the year 
these agreements are similar to the agreement we had entered into with au optronics  in that we record both commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues from our sales of materials under the agreements 
a small portion of our commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues for were from sales of our materials to chi mei el and lg display 
for the first seven months of  we supplied one of our proprietary pholed materials to au optronics corporation for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
under our agreement with au optronics  we recognized commercial chemical revenue of  and royalty and license revenues of  on account of our sales of this material to au optronics 
however  those sales ended when au optronics discontinued manufacturing the product for which it ordered our materials in the third quarter of  and we have not sold any commercial chemicals to au optronics since that time 
commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues from our material sales to au optronics represented a substantial component of our revenues for we cannot accurately predict how long our material sales to samsung sdi or other customers will continue  as they frequently update and alter their product offerings 
continued sales of our pholed materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including  pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
our royalty and license revenue for decreased substantially from due in large part to the difference in our business agreements with samsung sdi and au optronics 
as previously indicated  under the terms of our agreement with au optronics we recognized royalty and license revenue at the time we sold our proprietary pholed material to au optronics 
in contrast  under the terms of our agreement with samsung sdi  we recognize royalty revenue when samsung sdi reports to us the sale of commercial oled products made using our proprietary pholed technology and materials 
this can occur up to six months or more after the date on which we sell our pholed materials to samsung sdi 
for  we recognized  in royalty revenue on account of sales of these commercial oled products reported to us by samsung sdi for the first three quarters of the year 
as samsung sdi s product sales increase and its production yields improve  we anticipate our royalty revenue to increase as well 
there was no corresponding royalty revenue reported to us by samsung sdi for our royalty and license revenue for did  however  include license fees received under our patent license agreement with samsung sdi  as well as license fees received under our cross license agreement executed with dupont displays  inc we received upfront payments of license fees in connection with both of these agreements  and in addition we received an upfront payment of royalties under the agreement with samsung sdi 
all of these payments have been classified as deferred 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as royalty and license revenue over the life of our agreement with samsung sdi  and over years for our agreement with dupont displays 
the deferred royalties are being recognized as royalty and license revenue when sales of commercial oled products are reported to us by samsung sdi 
we recognized  in technology development revenue for  compared to  in corresponding revenue for technology development revenue for was derived from one technology development contract that we renewed and continued working under for the entire year 
for  we derived technology development revenue from this and three other contracts for technology development and similar services 
although in we continued working with all of the companies from which we derived technology development revenue for  our business arrangements with these companies have changed as the oled industry has evolved and our customers have refined their technology development strategies 
for example  we received a non refundable payment for the continuation of one of these technology development agreements in the third quarter of  which payment is creditable against future amounts payable under a commercial license agreement  if one is executed by a specified date 
due to this business arrangement  the payment has been recorded as a deferred license fee rather than technology development revenue 
business changes such as this one make it difficult for us to predict the amount and timing of our recognition of future revenues for technology development and similar services 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with our ewing facility  in  we received a refund from princeton university for unspent research and development funds of  no such refund was received in an increase of  in personnel costs due mainly to increased salaries  and an increase of  relating to the recognition of expenses for stock issuances to non employee members of our scientific advisory board  and for the vesting of shares of restricted stock previously issued to these individuals 
the increase was offset to some extent by a decrease of  in amounts paid to ppg industries under our oled materials supply and service agreement  as we brought a portion of the work previously performed by ppg industries in house 
included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of  and  for each of and  respectively 
these costs were associated with the two european patent opposition matters and a patent interference matter with semiconductor energy laboratory sel that was concluded in april  as described in response to item of this report legal proceedings 
we anticipate that our patent defense costs may increase as active matrix oled products using our pholed and other oled technologies and materials enter the consumer marketplace 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due mainly to an increase of  in personnel costs due to salary increases  and an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with our ewing facility 
royalty and license expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a reduction of  in royalties owed to motorola 
for  we had a minimum royalty obligation to motorola of  beginning with  however  we were no longer required to make minimum royalty payments to motorola 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributable to increased cash to invest due to funds received from a common stock offering that we completed in may  as well as higher rates of return on investments during of during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols and approximately  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and we received proceeds of  we expect to sell a similar quantity of nols to new jersey under the program in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to increased revenues of  and an increase of  in operating expenses 
the decrease in operating loss was offset to some extent by an increase of  in interest income 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in commercial chemical revenue of  an increase in royalty and license revenue of  and an increase in technology development revenue of  the increase was offset by the following a decrease in contract research revenue of  and a decrease in development chemical revenue of  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government for  compared to  for the decrease was mainly attributable to the level of work performed under government contracts and the achievement of milestones as specified within government contracts 
the number of government contracts we worked under and the level of effort performed under these contracts remained essentially constant from to we earned  from our sales of oled materials for development purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the decrease was mainly due to a decreased volume of development chemical purchases as a result of an oled product manufacturer transitioning from exclusively development chemical purchases in to primarily commercial chemical purchases in we cannot accurately predict the timing and frequency of development chemical purchases by our customers due to participants in the oled industry having differing oled technology development and product launch strategies  which are subject to change and adjustment 
for  our commercial chemical and our royalty and license revenues were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in the increase in commercial chemical revenue was due to purchases of our proprietary pholed materials for use in commercial oled products by two new customers 
in the fourth quarter of  we began supplying one of our proprietary pholed materials to samsung sdi for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
for the first seven months of  we also supplied one of our proprietary pholed materials to au optronics corporation for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
under our agreement with au optronics  we recognized commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues of  on account of our sales of this material to au optronics 
however  those sales ended when au optronics discontinued manufacturing the product for which it ordered our materials in the third quarter of  and we did not sell any commercial chemicals to au optronics after that time 
commercial chemical and royalty and license revenues from our material sales to au optronics represented a substantial component of our revenues for our royalty and license revenue for included license fees received under our patent license agreement with samsung sdi  as well as license fees received under our cross license agreement executed with dupont displays  inc we received upfront payments of license fees in connection with both of these agreements  and in addition we received an upfront payment of royalties under the agreement with samsung sdi 
all of these payments have been classified as deferred license fees and deferred revenue 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as royalty and license revenue over the term of our agreement with samsung sdi  and over years for our agreement with dupont displays 
the deferred royalties are being recognized as royalty and license revenue when sales of commercial oled products are reported to us by samsung sdi 
we recognized  in technology development revenue for  compared to  in corresponding revenue for although the number of technology development contracts that we were working under did not change between and  technology development revenues increased due mainly to work performed under a contract that commenced in the third quarter of the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and similar services is difficult to predict due to participants in the oled industry having differing technology development strategies 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increase of  in personnel costs  and an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with the expansion of our ewing facility 
the increase was offset to some extent by the following a refund from princeton university for unspent research and development funds of  a decrease of  in amounts payable to ppg industries due to the hiring of certain ppg employees as employees of ours  and a decrease of  relating to the recognition of expense for stock issuances to non employee members of our scientific advisory board 
included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of  and  for each of and  respectively 
these costs were associated with the two european patent opposition matters and a patent interference matter with semiconductor energy laboratory sel that was concluded in april  as described in response to item of this report legal proceedings 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was due mainly to an increase of  in personnel costs due to salary increases and the recognition of stock based compensation expenses under sfas no 
r  and an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with the expansion of our ewing facility 
royalty and license expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to  in additional royalties due to princeton university 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this was the result of higher rates of return on investments during during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from the sale of these nols and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and received proceeds from these sales of  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments of  for a total of  as of december  the increase in cash and investments of  was primarily due to proceeds received from the common stock offering we completed in may cash used in operating activities was  for  compared to  for the increased use of cash was mainly due to a decrease in non cash expenses under a development agreement of  a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and reduced receipts of deferred license fees and other deferred revenues of  the decrease in non cash expenses related mainly to a change in our relationship with ppg industries 
in  we transferred development work  which was previously conducted at ppg  to our own in house laboratories 
we had been paying for that work by issuing shares of our common stock 
once the work was transferred to us  those non cash expenses were eliminated  and the overall amounts payable to ppg industries were reduced 
the decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses related primarily to our agreement with motorola 
at december   we had million in royalties due to motorola  based on a minimum royalty obligation under our agreement 
this amount was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses for no such minimum royalty was due at december cash used in investing activities was  for  compared to  for the year ended the increase was mainly due to increased investment purchases using the funds we received from the common stock offering we completed in may cash provided by financing activities was  for  as compared to  for the increase was mainly due to the completion in may of our public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of  net of  in underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with completion of the offering 
working capital increased to  as of december   from  as of december  again  this increase was mainly due to proceeds from the common stock offering we completed in may we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and defense of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations through at least we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain  maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation  year total  year under our amended license agreement with princeton university  the university of southern california and the university of michigan  we are obligated to pay minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
the agreement has no scheduled expiration date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect that the adoption of these recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
as such  a change in interest rates of percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments
