the company also purchased and sold marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale investments in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and  million in marketable securities at december  the company also had outstanding borrowings totaling million at that date  all of which were classified as current obligations

the company s additional borrowing capacity  along with the expected expiration period of the commitments  is summarized as follows in millions amount of commitment total expiration per period amount less than in excess of committed year year unsecured credit facility and other lines of credit critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues  including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates 
because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the us dollar  the japanese yen and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period  with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately million 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets  and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity  by million to million from million at december  the company is partially self insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its self insured retention limits 
the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities
