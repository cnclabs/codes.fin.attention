item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the information set forth under item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook  our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
company overview we are one of the fastest growing cosmetics companies of the ten largest in the us mass market channel by retail sales 
we specialize in developing and marketing innovative  premium priced products for the mass market channel 
our products focus on addressing skin imperfections through a problem solution approach  unlike competitors whose products focus primarily on changing fashion trends 
our products address specific  everyday cosmetics needs and include face powders  bronzers  concealers  blushes  foundations  eye shadows  eye liners  brow makeup and mascaras 
we sell our products to mass market retailers such as wal mart  target  cvs  walgreens and albertsons 
our products provide above average profitability for retailers due to their higher price points and sales per linear foot 
our products are currently sold in approximately  of the  stores in which we estimate our masstige competitors products are sold 
we seek to be first to market with new products within this channel  and are able to take new products from concept development to shipment in less than months 
new products are a very important part of our business and have contributed  on average  approximately of our net sales for the last three years 
we have achieved significant growth over the last three years  driven largely by the yearly introduction of new products  the popularity of our innovative problem solution products and our ability to significantly expand the breadth and depth of our distribution network 
we have grown net sales to million in from million in  representing a compounded annual growth rate of 
factors affecting our operating results our net sales are impacted by advertising  discounts and promotions  merchandising  packaging  the availability of wall display space at our retailer customers and the timing of new product launches and line extensions  all of which have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
continued growth of our net sales and profitability will depend substantially on the continued popularity of our new and existing products  our ability to effectively manage our sales and distribution networks and our ability to maintain sufficient product supply to meet expected growth in demand 
we expect to sell a higher percentage of our products to retailer customers that require larger discounts and trade allowances  which would negatively impact our net sales and gross margin 
our cost of sales includes our costs to manufacture products in our own facilities  including raw material and labor costs and all overhead expenses related to production and quality control  as well as the cost to purchase components  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes  and semi finished goods  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes filled with product  from third party manufacturers and inbound freight 
we primarily purchase plastic component parts from manufacturers in china  rather than purchasing them through brokers 
this could result in a decrease in components costs 
conversely  increases in the costs for inbound freight due to higher fuel costs could increase our cost of sales 
on january   the california minimum wage increased to per hour 
we expect this change to increase our cost of sales by approximately  in the automation of an assembly line and our use of components and semi finished goods as well as our own manufacturing facilities have allowed us to maintain a low product cost base while providing significant production flexibility 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include all warehouse and outbound freight expenses  selling  marketing  research and development costs  finance  information technology  depreciation  amortization of intangibles  professional fees  non cash charges for stock based compensation for certain employees and administrative and distribution facility expenses 
factors affecting comparability seasonality our business  similar to others in the cosmetic industry  is subject to seasonal variation due to the annual sell in period when retailers decide how much retail space will be allotted to each supplier and the number of new and existing products to be offered in their stores 
for us  this period has historically been from december through april 
sales during these months are typically greater due to the shipments required to fill the inventory at retail stores and retailers warehouses 
retailers typically reset their retail selling space during these months to accommodate changes in space allocation to each supplier and to incorporate the addition of new products and the deletion of slow selling items 
our net sales for the three months ended december  were higher than our net sales for the three months ended september   as a result of this seasonality 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of reasons including the timing of new product introductions  general economic conditions or consumer buyer behavior 
in addition  results for any one quarter may not be indicative of results for the same quarter in subsequent years 
three months ended march june september december net sales income loss from operations net income loss net sales income loss from operations net income loss net sales income from operations net income results of predecessor prior to the acquisition  there was no charge allocated to us for compensation for andr pieters  our former chief executive officer  who was an employee of pierre fabre dermo cosmetique  sa pierre fabre  which was the parent company of pierre fabre  inc the predecessor s operations were previously included in the consolidated financial statements of pierre fabre 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a secondment agreement with pierre fabre pursuant to which mr 
pieters agreed to serve as our chief executive officer through december   and we paid pierre fabre for his services 
mr 
pieters extended his secondment for three months  and he returned full time to pierre fabre on march  through march   we reimbursed pierre fabre for his services at a monthly rate of approximately  effects of the public offerings and related transactions in connection with the initial public offering  we repaid amounts outstanding under our old senior credit agreement and repurchased our senior subordinated notes and replaced our old senior credit agreement with a new senior credit agreement  which reduced our interest expense in the three months ended december  the refinancing also resulted in a non cash charge to interest expense for the unamortized portion of the capitalized fees and expenses related to the old senior credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes of approximately million and a small loss related to our termination of the associated interest rate collar 
we amended the performance vesting options held by our senior management and certain employees to accelerate vesting of  performance vesting options upon the completion of the initial public offering 
the performance vesting options that did not vest and become exercisable upon completion of the initial public offering vest and become exercisable in equal installments over a period of two years from the date of the closing of the initial public offering 
the vesting resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million in the three months ended december  the amendment of the options also increased the number of our fully diluted shares outstanding by an amount that depends on the trading price of our common stock  and thus reduced our earnings per fully diluted share 
in addition  we paid a  cash bonus to our chief financial officer and  in cash bonuses to certain senior financial personnel upon completion of the initial public offering 
on april   the company completed a secondary public offering in which certain stockholders sold  shares of the company s common stock  which included  shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
the underwriters exercised this over allotment option on april  and the secondary public offering closed on april  the company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares but incurred approximately  of expenses related to the offering  including a  cash bonus to our chief financial officer upon completion of the secondary public offering 
results of operations the table below sets forth certain operating data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales of our face makeup products  as we continued to broaden our total distribution 
total distribution represents the number of stores in which we sell products multiplied by our number of stock keeping units per store 
unit sales for our face makeup increased by million units  or  to million units in from million units in new products represented of our net sales in compared to in partially offsetting our net sales growth in was a decrease in sales of our eye makeup products 
unit sales for our eye makeup decreased by million units  or  to million units in from million in trade spending with retailers increased by million  which includes an increase in cooperative advertising expense of million  an increase in our provision for markdowns of million  an increase in our provision for returns of million  an increase in our provision for cash discounts of million and an increase in our provision for coupon expense of million 
the variance is primarily due to management s strategic decision to increase trade spending with retailers for in store advertising and promotions to increase consumer retail sales 
during  our results included net sales of million from our international customers  compared to million for cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from an increase in volume in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to an increase in the write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory of million offset by a slight decrease in the recovery of inventory returns of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at million in and the slight variance was primarily due to a million increase in marketing spending and a million increase in fixed costs that included a million increase in employee compensation associated with our growth  a million expense for transaction fees associated with the secondary public offering  a million increase in distribution costs related to our growth  a million increase in depreciation expense  as well as an increase in accounting and other expenses associated with being a public company 
in addition  there were higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  including a million increase in outbound freight costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was offset by a decrease of million for our stock options awards due to a charge of million associated with the acceleration of vesting of certain performance vesting options in connection with our initial public offering 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the decrease in average borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as we repaid all borrowings under our former senior credit agreement with the proceeds of the initial public offering 
other income other income increased  or  to  in  from  in  which consisted primarily of realized and unrealized gains related to investments held as part of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  state and local income taxes

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales of our face and eye makeup products  as we continued to expand our distribution throughout our sales channels and increase awareness through increased marketing spending 
total unit volume increased by million units  or  to million units in from million units in the total unit volume increase was partially offset by a reduction in subcontracted unit volume of million units with our former parent company  pierre fabre  which expired on november  excluding subcontracting unit volumes  total unit volume increased in as compared to in addition  we sold a greater percentage of higher priced face powders products this year 
partially offsetting our net sales growth for was an increase in our return provision due to higher returns resulting from our retailer customers wall display changes  an increase in promotional returns  and a retailer customer consolidation 
also  partially offsetting our net sales growth for was an increase in trade allowances that was attributable primarily to incremental coupon expenses 
during  our results included net sales of million from our international customers  compared to million for cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was of net sales in  compared to in the increase in the cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was attributable to higher inbound freight costs of million  an increase in product costs of million and an increase of million in labor costs 
inbound freight was higher due to air freight associated with the greater demands for product to fill year end orders 
the increase in the product costs  as a percentage of net sales  is due to the decrease in net sales growth as a result of an increase in the returns provision and trade allowances as discussed above 
the increased product labor costs were driven by an increase in temporary outsourcing of production 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was principally due to a million stock based compensation charge associated with the acceleration of vesting of certain performance vesting options in connection with our initial public offering  initial public offering bonuses of  and higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  including a million increase in marketing driven by increases in advertising and promotion 
in addition  we incurred increased costs of approximately  related to preparing for compliance with sarbanes oxley requirements and various incremental costs associated with being a public company

the increase in the percentage was partially offset by higher net sales in interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in interest expense was due to the increase in average borrowings outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility  the increase in average long term debt as a result of our recapitalization in december  an increase in interest rates during the year and the write off of capitalized bank fees for indebtedness that was repaid in connection with our initial public offering 
we repaid all borrowings under our former senior credit agreement with the net proceeds of the initial public offering and borrowings under our senior credit agreement

liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of december   we had in cash and cash equivalents compared to  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the low level of cash reflects the use of cash to pay down the revolving credit facility on a regular basis 
as of december   we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
the significant components of our working capital are accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt 
net working capital requirements increased by million  or approximately  to million in from million in working capital requirements increased during the fourth quarter of  when we typically experience higher inventory levels as we produce new products for shipment in the first quarter of the following year 
we have budgeted capital expenditures of million for for several key projects  including investment in our information technology infrastructure and improvements to our manufacturing and distribution equipment 
capital requirements related to manufacturing include a major project undertaken in to automate a product assembly line that is used to assemble products that represented approximately of our total sales in we expect the aggregate capital requirements of this project to total million  of which million was incurred in in addition to an estimated million required to complete the assembly line project  we expect to need to make improvements to other manufacturing and distribution equipment at a cost of approximately million  improvements to our leasehold facilities of approximately million and improvements to our information technology infrastructure at a cost of approximately million in in  our capital expenditures totaled approximately million  which was in line with our budget 
the capital expenditures included the initiation of the automated product assembly line and the replacement and upgrade of our ibm a s mainframe computer to accommodate future growth 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and funds from our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million in  from million for in the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from unfavorable changes in working capital and lower non cash activities impacting net income

cash used in investing activities in was  which was related to basic capital expenditures for the replacement and upgrade of machinery and equipment 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from higher net borrowings under the line of credit 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the decrease in cash used in financing activities between periods primarily resulted from the net proceeds received from our initial public offering and borrowings under our senior credit agreement 
this was partially offset by our repayments of borrowings under our old senior credit agreement and repurchase of our senior subordinated notes 
credit facilities on november   physicians formula  inc entered into a senior credit agreement with a bank that will terminate in and consists of a million term loan facility and a revolving credit facility providing for borrowings of up to million 
at december   there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at an interest rate of and we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding letters of credit as of december  the interest rate on the term loan was at december  the availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
we used the borrowings under the senior credit agreement and a portion of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to repay borrowings and accrued interest under the old senior credit agreement 
borrowings under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed by physicians formula holdings  inc and the domestic subsidiary of physicians formula  inc  and borrowings under the senior credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of physicians formula  inc  including the assets of its subsidiary 
amounts outstanding under the term loan facility totaled million at december  payments under the term loan facility are due quarterly  increasing from initial quarterly payments of  to  as of december    as of december    as of december  and  as of december  quarterly payments of  were made on january   april   july  and october  and a quarterly payment of  was made on january  amounts outstanding under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility bears interest at a libor adjusted rate as defined in the senior credit agreement plus or at a base rate as defined in the senior credit agreement plus 
the revolving credit facility is also subject to a commitment fee of one quarter of on any unused commitments 
the senior credit agreement contains the following financial covenants a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum net worth requirement  and a limitation on capital expenditures which may be no more than  per fiscal year 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
the senior credit agreement contains certain additional negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur other indebtedness and liens  fundamentally change in our business through a merger  consolidation  amalgamation or liquidation  sell assets  pay cash dividends from physicians formula  inc or pay for expenses of physicians formula holdings  inc  unless certain conditions are satisfied  make certain acquisitions  investments  loans and advances  engage in transactions with our affiliates  enter into certain agreements  engage in sale leaseback transactions  incur certain unfunded liabilities  and change our line of business 
the senior credit agreement requires us to make mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions and upon the receipt of insurance or condemnation proceeds to the extent we do not use the proceeds for the purchase of satisfactory replacement assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands revolving credit facility long term debt obligations interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations deferred compensation total for variable interest rate debt  the amounts included were calculated using  the rate that was in effect as of december  under the senior credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts that rely on estimation techniques to calculate fair value 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure as of the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  returns  trade allowances  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from direct sales to retailers and wholesalers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales a reserve for product returns  which includes actual returns to date and an amount established for anticipated product returns  as well as trade allowances 
our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer 
allowances for estimated returns are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
in the past  returns provisions have been adjusted higher or lower during the course of a fiscal year depending on actual results to date and anticipated returns for the remainder of a year 
experience has shown a relationship between gross sales and sales returns in the subsequent period  as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for known or anticipated events that we have considered  and will continue to consider  including the solvency of our customers  store closings by retailers  changes in the retail environment and decisions to continue to support new and existing products 
actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual returns exceed reserves  we would need to reduce our revenues at the time of such determination 
we have not experienced any material differences between the allowances for estimated returns and actual returns 
we offer trade allowances such as rebates  price protection  coupons and other incentives to customers in the normal course of business 
accruals for these allowances are provided for based on estimates and historical experience and are recorded as a reduction of net sales when the related revenue is recorded 
we have not experienced any material differences between the trade allowance accruals and actual trade allowances 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are identified based on historical trends  sales projections and future known or anticipated events 
when inventory is identified as slow moving or obsolete  we record an inventory write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on the amounts we expect to recover from third parties  including our arrangement with a third party liquidator 
this write down is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
we have not experienced any material differences between write downs and actual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and specific intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
to apply sfas no 
 a company is divided into separate reporting units  each representing groups of activities that are separately managed 
for this purpose  we have one reporting unit 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill is determined using the income approach  which focuses on the income producing capability of an asset  measuring the current value of the asset by calculating the present value of its future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax deductions  and proceeds from disposition 
value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation and risks associated with the particular investment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company has not recorded any goodwill impairment charges as a result of this annual process 
other indefinite lived assets consist of trade names and are not amortized as they are considered an indefinite lived intangible asset 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
it is management s intent to leverage the trade names indefinitely into the future 
the physicians formula trade name has been used since and is a recognized brand within the cosmetics industry 
other intangible assets consist primarily of patents and distributor relationships 
patents and distributor relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
intangible assets related to patents and distributor relationships are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
management estimated the useful life of the patents on the base technology that has been in existence for many years and is expected to continue through the estimated useful life and the useful life of the distributor relationships based on historical attrition 
share based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the prospective method 
under the prospective method  those nonpublic companies that previously used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes apply sfas no 
r prospectively to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  we will continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at december  using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards which were the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretive guidance 
under sfas no 
r  share based payments awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock will be based on companies of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected life of options granted represents management s best estimate based upon historical and expected trends in the company s stock option activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the long term deferred income tax liabilities primarily relate to the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition 
the company adopted fin on january   and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense 
total unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalties were not significant at january  as of december   we have current net deferred income tax assets of million and non current net deferred income tax liabilities of million 
future earnings  more likely than not  are expected to be sufficient for the realization of our deferred income tax assets 
if future earnings are less than expected  then a valuation allowance may be recorded

environmental matters as discussed under item business  we have environmental liabilities at our city of industry facility 
these involve both onsite and regional groundwater contamination 
we also have indemnities that have covered  and that we expect will continue to cover  most of the environmental liabilities 
the indemnities were given to us by prior owners of the business  by a former operator of the facility and its insurer  by a prior owner s successor  and by a company with which we entered into a settlement indemnifying us for further regional groundwater contamination liabilities 
based on our past dealings with these entities and the nature of their contractual commitments  we expect that they will continue to indemnify most of our environmental liabilities 
some of the entities could contest a future indemnification demand we could make for some aspects of our potential environmental liabilities 
we believe all of the entities are financially able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in nature 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not currently affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of sales and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products offered by us 
forward looking statements this section and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  believes  plans  predicts  and similar terms 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed in item a 
risk factors 
unless otherwise required by law  we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we sell our products to canadian customers in canadian dollars and pay overseas suppliers and third party manufacturers in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could result in lower net sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
further  a decrease in the value of the euro and the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar could cause our suppliers to raise prices  which would result in higher cost of sales 
the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy 
our current sales to canadian customers and reliance on foreign suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used to produce products make it possible that our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies of our customers and suppliers
