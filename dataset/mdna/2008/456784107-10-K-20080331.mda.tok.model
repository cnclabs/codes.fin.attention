this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes  as well as the risk factors and other information contained in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to  among other things  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates and assumptions 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations  although they could 
our critical accounting policies  the policies we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  are outlined below in critical accounting policies  and have not changed significantly since our annual report for fiscal all references to results of operations in this discussion are references to results of continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
overview we are one of the premier distributors and providers of wireless handsets and accessories in latin america and  to a lesser extent  the united states 
we provide end to end handset and wireless terminal solutions for carriers in both latin america and the united states 
we distribute products of several key original equipment manufacturers oems  including samsung  lg  novatel and others

we provide these services for wireless handset manufacturers in order to facilitate sales to carriers  agents  resellers  distributors  independent dealers and retailers in latin america and the united states 
during  we significantly changed our business model from selling products to dealers and agents in the united states and latin america to providing products  services and solutions primarily to wireless carriers in such regions 
as a result  we believe that this shift in customer focus has enabled us to better service our customers and vendors as we play a more important role in the supply chain for wireless handsets and accessories 
also in  we introduced a proprietary line of handsets and accessories under the verykool brand 
areas of management focus and performance indicators we focus on the needs of our customers  developing and maintaining close relationships with manufacturers  expanding in and entering into new markets  and sourcing and developing new and innovative products  while maintaining close attention to operational efficiencies and costs 
we are focused on increasing shipping volumes and improving efficiencies to enable higher levels of profitability and earnings growth  in addition to monitoring and managing levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
we provide distribution and other services for oems  such as samsung and lg  and our own proprietary line of verykool handsets 
performance indicators that are key for the monitoring and management of our business include operating and net income  cost of sales and gross margin percentage  operating expenses as a percent of revenues  and overall net sales growth 
we make extensive use of our customized information system to closely monitor all aspects of our business  including customer relationship management  intelligent purchasing  inventory control  and inventory flow  line item margin control for every order  and weighted average cost and statistical data for every product  customer and supplier 
we believe a strong focus on providing better service to customers leads to increased customer satisfaction and retention and potential increases in sales 
management spends a significant amount of time traveling with the purpose of spending time with key customers  suppliers and employees 
we believe that these relationships are vital to our success and we will continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to this area 
industry trends  challenges  risks and growth opportunities according to a january report by cowen and company  in  overall worldwide wireless handset sales increased by approximately  and are forecasted to increase in and in the two largest areas of growth are africa and asia pacific  regions in which we do not currently operate 
a rapid decline in wireless handset sales growth could negatively impact our net sales 
excess supply conditions can reduce the market prices of the products we sell and therefore affect our ability to generate net sales and gross profit at expected levels and could affect the value of our inventory 
for example  some us regional carrier consolidation resulted in a decrease in the value of some of our inventory carried for that region  which inventory was sold below our cost during conversely  should manufacturers be unable to respond to an unanticipated increase in demand on a timely basis  we  along with others in our industry  could experience supply constraints that would affect our ability to deliver products 
we are unable to quantify these effects  as it is difficult to predict future supply conditions and demand patterns which affect our ability to meet customer demand or sell handsets at an acceptable gross profit 
company specific trends  challenges risks and growth opportunities our strategy incorporates overall market growth elements for each aspect of our business  which we hope will result in growth 
certain of our manufacturers entered into the low tier handset market during  which had a positive impact on our volumes of handsets sold 
however  such low tier handsets carry lower profit margins  thus negatively impacting our overall gross margin 
during  we substantially increased our inventory level in anticipation of and preparation for potential sales 
our verykool proprietary line of products  for which we have six models selling as of december   showed a ramp up of sales in the second half of  and could be an important part of our overall business in the future 
in  our net sales increased by  and handset units sold increased by  after increasing in although we have incorporated growth into our strategy  there can be no assurances that we will continue to grow and if so at what levels 
year ended december  amounts in  s except percentages net sales    units sold  increase over prior year average selling price  decrease over prior year results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million were comparable to our net sales of million for the year ended december  handsets sold during the year ended december  increased  as compared to the same period in  however  this increase was offset by a decrease in the average selling price of 
the geographic mix of net sales shifted for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of sales in the united states increased to of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to of net sales for the same period in in contrast  our net sales in central america decreased to of our net sales for the year ended december   as compared to of net sales for the same period our south america region continued to represent the majority of our business  accounting for of our net sales for  as compared to for this regional shift in net sales was the result of two primary factors 
product availability in the united states increased in the beginning of  enabling us to purchase more products and sell more products to our customers  which was offset by the impact of the consolidation of the us regional carriers in the later part of  resulting in some of our inventory being sold at prices below our costs  and limiting our existing and potential customer base in the us going forward 
the central america region had excess inventory in the channel during the first quarter of  reducing sales 
the channel inventory began to return to normalized levels during the second quarter and remained so for the balance of enabling sales to increase and end the year at nearly one third of total net sales 
in south america  our efforts enabled sales to new customers and new countries as well as additional sales to existing customers 
these increases were offset by the decrease in overall average product unit selling price due to our manufacturing partners entering into the low tier product segment 
this region continues to experience a general increase in handset sales 
year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages south america   central america   united states   totals   cost of sales  gross margin and gross profit for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in our total cost of sales was a direct result of various factors  including our increased sales levels on a consolidated basis and increased product mix of higher cost products  including verykool products  as well as the one time increased costs related to the sales of certain us inventory during the third quarter of in the central america region  in the beginning of  a significant decrease in handset demand as a result of industry wide excess inventory in the channel for that particular region also impacted our ability to sell higher margin products 
during the second quarter and then the balance of  we saw channel inventory generally return to normalized levels in central america 
our gross margin continues to be impacted by the change of product and regional mix of our sales  as different products and different regions can have varying margins 
additionally  our gross margin was negatively impacted as certain of our manufacturers entered into the low tier handset range 
lastly  we incurred an increase in losses on the sale of our us inventory  due to acquisitions of some of the us regional carriers in these acquisitions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on our us customer base and future us sales opportunities 
for the year ended december   our gross profit decreased to million from million for the same period in  a decrease of 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of increased sales in latin america of low tier products which have lower margins  higher channel inventory levels and lower sales in central america during the first quarter of  and losses taken on sales of certain us inventory in connection with the consolidation of some of the us regional carriers 
these factors depressed gross margin and decreased the opportunity for sales of higher margin products 
year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   gross margin operating expenses and operating income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses increased compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses were for the years ended december  and during the year ended december   we incurred expenses related primarily to our investments in facilities  marketing  as well as engineering and product and market development  predominantly attributable to our proprietary verykool product line 
we believe such investments are necessary to grow our business  including the verykool products 
the year ended december  included non cash expense related to stock options of  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our operating loss from continuing operations was million  primarily due to the reasons discussed above including the introduction of low tier  low margin products in latin america by some of our vendors and the million of costs relating to the sales of certain us inventory in connection with the consolidation of some of the us regional carriers  compared with income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of  shifting from income in to a loss in as a percentage of net sales  operating loss from continuing operations was for the year ended december   compared to income of for the year ended december  the shift from operating income to an operating loss from continuing operations was generally the result of the decrease in gross margin discussed above 
operating expenses year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages net sales   operating expenses   percentage of revenue operating income loss from continuing operations year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages net sales   operating income loss from continuing operations   percentage of revenue other income expense during the year ended december   we had totaled other income of million  as compared to  for the same period in during the year ended december  we had income of million from a voluntary early lease termination and relocation of our corporate headquarters in san diego 
we incurred million of interest expense for the year ended december   compared to interest expense of  for the same period last year 
this increase was due primarily to the increase in levels of verykool inventory and overall higher levels of accounts receivable during the year  requiring credit line usage 
we expect to regularly utilize larger amounts on our revolving line of credit  which will increase our interest expense in future periods 
during the year ended december   we had income of million from our former landlord for a voluntary early lease termination and relocation of our corporate headquarters in san diego 
during the year ended december   we had income from a non cash change in fair value of derivative liability relating to january financing related warrants of  year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages change in fair value of derivative liability other income  interest expense other income  total  net income loss during the year ended december   our net loss was million  compared to net income of million in the same period in this loss was primarily related to the factors discussed above  including our decreased sales in the central america region in the first quarter  our reduced gross profit margin  including an increase in cost of goods sold related to sales of us inventory  and increased operational expenses and investments relating to our proprietary line of verykool products  partially offset by other income related to our voluntary lease termination and relocation of our corporate headquarters in san diego and a positive provision for income taxes

total  provision benefit for taxes   net income loss   year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  our net sales increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  such increase was primarily attributable to a increase in wireless handset volume  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price per unit sold 
the number of wireless handsets increased primarily as a result of an overall increase in market demand and the addition of new suppliers and customers 
the manufacturers we represent continued to launch new competitively priced products thereby increasing demand for such products 
during the year ended december   our geographic mix of net sales shifted significantly as our sales in south america and central america increased substantially 
these two regions represented for south america and for central america of our net sales for the year ended december   compared to for south america and for central america for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of our increased sales and marketing efforts in both of those regions  as well as the general increase in wireless handsets sold in those regions 
sales in the united states made up the remainder of our sales for the year ended december   declining to million  or of net sales  over the year ended december  the decrease in our united states sales resulted from increased competition and product supply constraints from our primary vendors 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to see an easing of supply constraints and our sales for the united states more than doubled sequentially over the third quarter of year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages south america   central america   united states   totals   cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in our cost of sales was a direct result of the increased wireless handset sales volume during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our gross profit increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of increased wireless handset sales levels  partially offset by the decrease in gross margin 
for the year ended december   our gross margin percentage decreased to from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the change of product and regional mix of our sales  including higher sales in central america  as different products and different regions have varying margins 
year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages cost of sales   gross profit   gross margin operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses were million  an increase of  compared with million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses were and  respectively  in each of the years ended december  and this increase was primarily the result of increased personnel costs in support of overall growth in unit volumes and geographic expansion 
during  we opened a new facility in mexico which has yet to fully realize operational efficiencies 
in addition we incurred non cash compensation expense in of million or of net sales  relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r for expensing stock options  compared to no such expense for the fiscal year ended december  operating expenses year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages operating expenses   percentage of revenue for the year ended december   our operating income from continuing operations was million including a non cash expense of million relating to the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  compared with million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  operating income from continuing operations was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was a result of the non cash expense related to sfas r and the decrease in gross margin 
operating income from continuing operations year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages operating income from continuing operations   percentage of revenue income from continuing operations for the year ended december   we had income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share on net sales of million 
this is an increase of  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages income from continuing operations   other income expense for the year ended december   we had other income of  as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  during  we had other income from a change in fair value of a derivative liability of  and no such derivative liability in the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   the decrease in interest expense is due to our additional cash resources as a result of the fund raising completed during the first quarter of  together with our vendors increased credit lines for our purchases  which supports the increase in our accounts payable to million at december  compared to million at december  year ended december  increase decrease amounts in  s except percentages change in fair value of derivative liability interest expense other income expense net income for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per diluted share on net sales of million

the net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from increased inventory levels and increased accounts receivable 
the million increase in inventory at december  included a million increase in prepaid inventory 
this increase was primarily attributable to the build up of verykool inventory in anticipation of future sales 
additionally  accounts receivable increased million primarily due to increased sales prior to the period end reported 
accounts payable at december  increased million  compared to december  this increase was related to our increase use of our vendors lines of credit during the year ended december  days of sales outstanding days of sales outstanding the average number of days it takes to collect revenue after a sale is made at december  were days  compared with days at december  this decrease was due to our continuous efforts to keep customers to the payment terms we provide 
normal payment terms require our customers to pay on a net day or net day basis depending on the customer 
we are constantly working with our customers to reduce our days of sales outstanding 
the extension of net day terms was required to remain competitive in several of the regions we currently operate  most notably in central and south america 
in an effort to penetrate new markets and reach new customers  we may offer terms beyond our normal terms 
cash used in investing activities the net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this use of cash is primarily the result of our investment in tooling and molds for our proprietary verykool products 
net cash provided from financing activities the net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  of million was primarily the result of borrowings on our bank line of credit and approximately  from the exercise of employee stock options 
working capital our net working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  this decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts payable  line of credit balance outstanding and inventory for the year ended december   partially offset by the decrease in our cash balance and increased borrowings from our line of credit

in addition there was also an increase in our inventory  including prepaid inventory  of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
our discontinued operations provided cash of  for the year ended december   as compared with cash used of  for the year ended december  the combined effect of continued and discontinued operations resulted in an increase of cash used in operations to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  days of sales outstanding days of sales outstanding the average number of days it takes to collect revenue after a sale is made at december  were days  compared with days at december  normal payment terms require our customers to pay on a net day or net day basis depending on the region

we increased the amount drawn on our revolving line of credit to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increased borrowing was necessary to finance our growth 
working capital our net working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  this increase was primarily due to our january sale of common stock and related warrants to purchase our common stock and net income for the year ended december  borrowings the company has a line of credit from wells fargo hsbc trade bank na  which provides for advances not to exceed of eligible domestic accounts receivable and up to of foreign insured accounts receivable depending on the country of the debtor  up to a maximum of million 
as of december   the majority of our debt was based on foreign insured accounts receivable 
interest is payable on a monthly basis i at wells fargo s prime rate minus at march  or ii at the one month libor plus plus at march  
the interest rate is floating at wells fargo s prime rate or is at libor plus if the debt is a fixed amount drawn upon 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  and expires october  in addition to reporting and other non financial covenants  the line of credit contains certain financial covenants which require us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million plus of net profit after tax from january   a pre tax profit of not less than on a rolling four quarter basis  a quick ratio of not less than one to one  a debt to net worth ratio of not greater than two to one  and an annual net income after taxes of at least at december   the company did not meet the financial covenants related to pretax profit or net income 
the company received a waiver from wells fargo relating to default rights wells fargo may have due to the company failing to meet certain of these financial covenants at december  the company cannot provide assurance that it will or will not be able to comply with the financial covenants in the future and may seek additional waivers  which may or may not be granted 
the company is expected to request a waiver for the period ended march  we have no other debt financing payable 
at december  and december   the amounts drawn against the line of credit were million and million  respectively 
credit lines have been important parts of growing our business  and market changes affecting accounts receivable could diminish the borrowing base of available funds 
at december  and december   advances were at and of the available borrowing base 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results  and require management s judgments to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products are determined 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative arrangements marketing  training and promotional funds  returns  and allowances 
consideration is given on select sales for cooperative arrangements related to market development  training and special promotions  usually agreed upon in advance 
the amount given is generally in the form of a credit memo  which is applied as a reduction of the sale price and such amount is recorded as a current liability 
expenditures made pursuant to the agreed upon activity reduce this liability 
to the extent that we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize that amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis and adjust the estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in revenue and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment on a net or day basis depending on the customer 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change  including increased risk of collectibility and sales returns  and may require additional provisions  which could negatively impact our operating results 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally three months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant demand forecast for the applicable period 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we limit inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding several months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  we sometimes build inventories in excess of demand for the applicable future periods 
if this occurs  we provide a reserve  which may have a negative impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
such was the case in the fourth quarter of  as we adjusted some of our inventory down to market values 
contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
certain of these leases contain renewal options 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also have a revolving line of credit facility  which is shown on our balance sheet as a current liability and the balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following is a schedule of aggregate future minimum rental payments required by the above leases 
in addition  our future minimum lease requirements include obligations for the retail lease locations we have assigned to a third party  because we remain financially liable should the assignee default on the assigned leases 
there are approximately two months of lease payments in escrow that are held by a third party in the event of assignee default 
we believe these lease locations are desirable and anticipate that  if necessary  we would be able to find a suitable tenant for these locations within two months after any default by the assignee 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years revolving line of credit   operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations   total     the outstanding balance varies daily includes buildings  equipment and retail kiosks from discontinued operations  amounts do not reflect lease extension entered march  see note of the financial statements in this report

fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position  that based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption

this sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose

in october  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements

that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to eitf are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding revolving line of credit 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the prime rate minus at march  or libor plus plus at march  
for every increase in our bank s prime rate or libor  our interest expense would increase by  assuming the same million remained outstanding for the entire year 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that we would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
market risk a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets outside the united states  however all sales transactions and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for both our domestic and foreign sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations had did not have a material impact on our financial results during  or
