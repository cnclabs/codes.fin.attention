page intentionally left blank part i item business 
overview we are an operations and process improvement services firm headquartered in irving  texas providing process improvement solutions to enhance business efficiency  competitiveness and financial performance 
we develop and employ methodologies to transform the processes  procedures and people within our clients organizations to enable more efficient and seamless operations 
our methodologies address business processes throughout the extended enterprise 
extended enterprise is a term we use to describe the full spectrum of a client s value chain from its suppliers  through its internal operations  and to its customers 
historically  we have successfully applied our methodologies in engagements for both government entities and global and fortune companies in a number of industries 
during the past four years  however  we have been engaged primarily by various government entities to implement our operations management solutions 
as specialists in operations and process improvement  we create and implement operations management solutions to remove barriers  increase productivity  improve cultures and enable our clients to improve and sustain performance as measured by the following total cycle time  cost savings  time to market  product yields  delivery lead times  inventory turns  operational and administrative productivity  and return on assets 
to deliver these solutions  we utilize our staff of professionals  whom we refer to as resultants  and who average over years of business experience 
to manage our client engagements  our resultants typically leverage our process value management  or pvm  approach  which often incorporates our proprietary total cycle time  or tct  methodology along with other industry accepted process improvement methodologies such as kaizan  lean  six sigma and theory of constraints 
pvm is used to manage client engagements  identify process inefficiencies and implement change within our clients in order to achieve a total transformation to what we refer to as the process managed enterprise 
a process managed enterprise is one in which management focus and systems are centered on customers and managed around processes 
the following principles guide us when we assess  architect  implement and deliver continuous improvements to transform our clients into process managed enterprises all businesses are made up of a series of linked processes  from the initial business concept through all its applied resources and its end customer 
all processes  left unmanaged  naturally deteriorate over time 
people working in cross functional teams and focusing on customer needs are what make processes effective 
operational change is achieved by employing a combination of our proprietary methodologies and industry best practices  and is implemented using a metrics driven approach without additional capital expenditure by the client 
the client is the final arbiter of the value of the process 
the transformation to the process managed enterprise must deliver short term operating results as well as continuous  long term  systemic business enhancements 
industry background businesses operate in increasingly complex environments 
markets are becoming progressively larger and more global  offering companies the opportunity to expand their presence but also exposing them to increased competition and operational uncertainties 
as a result  many companies will frequently evaluate their business processes in order to manage change and risk  reduce costs  increase productivity  improve quality and drive higher profitability in order to be more competitive within their respective industries and the global marketplace 
in order to best accomplish these goals  we believe both management and business systems must be focused on customers needs and the processes that strengthen the customers perception of value 
these goals are typically achieved by increasing resource utilization  reducing cycle time  reducing procurement inefficiencies and reducing costs 
similar to commercial enterprises  government entities compete for scarce budget resources and are seeking methods by which to decrease inefficiencies  thereby saving taxpayer dollars and reducing burdens on under staffed agencies 
as a result  many government entities are choosing to bring private industry best practices to federal programs in an effort to improve efficiency 
commercial enterprises and government entities frequently lack the internal strategic expertise or the dedicated staff necessary to address operational challenges and implement corrective solutions 
in an effort to streamline operations and achieve higher returns on investment  companies and government entities are turning to consultants with specialized operational expertise and experience 
we believe firms employing senior professionals with executive management experience are well positioned to help large organizations and government entities solve complex business challenges and improve and sustain operational performance 
competitive strengths we believe the following factors are strengths of our company and provide us with key competitive advantages experienced professional staff we believe our most important asset is the knowledge base and experience of our resultants 
it is our policy to be highly selective in our hiring practices and to employ seasoned executives with extensive management experience 
our resultants average over years of business experience and approximately have held senior management positions with previous employers 
our resultants backgrounds in executive management roles allow them to better relate to the business challenges faced by our clients senior management 
our resultants are critical to developing long term client relationships  which can span multiple engagements 
we believe that their expertise and experience significantly improve our ability to effectively market our capabilities  implement operational improvements and deliver return on investment to our clients 
emphasis on results the success of each client engagement is defined by our ability to deliver measurable results 
our results can be measured by our clients productivity improvements  which are derived directly from the operational changes we implement  and by our clients cost savings and return on investment that ultimately result from these productivity improvements 
in appropriate client situations  we are willing to base a portion of our fees on achieving desired results by incorporating incentive based fees into the total fee structure 
these incentive fees are based on predetermined client specific measures  such as the achievement of specified process improvements  cost reductions or designated goals 
we believe this demonstrates confidence in our ability to deliver positive results to our clients 
focus on implementation and continuous improvement we stress a hands on implementation of process improvements and focus on the institutionalization of changes that improve the efficiency of our clients businesses and processes 
we apply our process improvement methodologies throughout our clients extended enterprises in close cooperation with our clients management to effectively eliminate process barriers  thereby improving cycle time  quality or first pass yield that is  doing it right the first time and overall operational performance 
as part of each client engagement  we conduct knowledge management sessions  which provide our clients with essential information  training and skills necessary to sustain continuous improvement 
in contrast  we believe many of our competitors often leave their clients with a written assessment or report  but generally do not work with company management to actually implement the changes 
our resultants not only identify and analyze a client s critical business processes  but also implement and institutionalize process improvements into a client s day to day business practices in an effort to provide lasting  transformational results 
reputation we have built a reputation as a leader in providing operational process improvement solutions that solve complex business problems 
through our client successes  we have established a strong reputation for our expertise in delivering collaborative  cross functional results across the extended enterprise 
we believe our industry reputation along with a high level of client referrals helps us source new engagements and is evidence of the value we offer to our clients 
operations and process improvement solutions we specialize in implementing solutions that achieve measurable and sustainable results including reductions in cost and improved financial performance 
we manage our client engagements by applying our pvm approach  a holistic approach that defines the steps necessary to improve strategic business processes  assesses their linkages and efficiencies  and prescribes short and long term enhancement programs 
our resultants specialize in operational process improvement solutions that can be applied to clients in a variety of industries 
our process improvement solutions address product development  resource utilization  procurement  cycle time  customer service  operations logistics  inventory turns and other business challenges 
specific examples of our solutions to these business challenges include product development cycle time reductions 
in a competitive environment  the time required to get a product to market can significantly affect a company s market position 
we deliver operations management solutions that identify barriers in the product development process and implement efficiencies that reduce cycle time and speed product development 
reducing the time required to get a product to market can increase customer satisfaction  lower costs and enhance our clients ability to respond timely to evolving market conditions 
procurement and sourcing 
inefficiencies in procurement and sourcing tend to increase costs 
we work with our clients to achieve measurable savings by addressing the entire procurement process including contract negotiations  vendor selection  contract compliance  consumption patterns  total cost of ownership  performance measurement  knowledge transfer and make versus buy decisions 
implementation of our solutions has enabled many of our clients to achieve substantial savings in a wide variety of spend categories including office supplies  telecommunications  technology hardware  software and services  insurance  printing services  travel and other industry specific categories 
operations logistics 
inefficiencies within enterprises  particularly those with complex business processes  often result from a lack of coordination among business units or other functional groups 
our solutions address these inefficiencies by improving operations logistics across the extended enterprise  and include business process reengineering  identification of facility inefficiencies with respect to people  parts and layout  as well as operational testing  evaluation  implementation and training 
our operations logistics engagements often lead to significant productivity improvement and cost savings 
growth strategy our strategy to grow our business includes the following attract  hire  develop  train and retain highly qualified senior resultants we are in the consulting services industry and rely heavily on the quality of our professionals to drive our success 
we believe attracting  hiring  developing  training and retaining experienced professionals significantly improves our ability to achieve desired client results  and the quality of our resultants is critical to both our industry reputation and our success in obtaining new business 
we believe our culture and the opportunity to work collaboratively on interesting assignments attracts high quality resultants and leads to low attrition rates 
we invest in our resultants career progression by providing training and development programs designed to match their skill sets with the needs of our clients 
leverage our track record of success we have built a track record of client satisfaction through the efficient and successful completion of complex projects for our government and large commercial clients 
as a result  we have established a solid reputation and many of our clients continue to serve as excellent references for us 
as a key element of our future growth  we intend to leverage our reputation with existing and past clients to win new business and seek repeat business opportunities with existing and former clients  many of which have multiple operating divisions 
we will continue to expand efforts to promote our successes and to utilize our resultants unique experience and skill sets to secure new client engagements 
expand sales and marketing we believe the proliferation of global markets and complex business environments will continue to drive demand for process improvement expertise  significantly enhancing the market opportunity for our solutions 
to adequately address client opportunities on a wider scale  we intend to invest in our sales and marketing as a means of accelerating our market presence  increasing our reputation as a knowledge leader and securing new client engagements 
we intend to continue building upon the strength of our brand and further promote awareness through a variety of traditional sales and marketing activities such as knowledge sessions  white papers  press interviews and conference speaking engagements 
we continually update the content and functionality of our website 
collectively  we believe these programs will help clarify and differentiate our capabilities from our competition 
as an example  we currently have alliances with established academic programs  including the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania 
through these programs  we host knowledge sessions and events with senior level executive attendees  which reinforce our subject matter expertise in the field of operations and process improvement services 
the content of these events is typically focused on addressing key business and operational challenges faced by large companies and generally produce a number of quality sales leads 
we believe the synergy of our operational expertise combined with the strategic and technical skills of these partners will reinforce our position as knowledge leaders in the minds of potential clients and greatly improve our ability to market our services 
target repeat client engagements we intend to leverage our prior engagement successes with existing and former clients to identify additional opportunities to apply our solutions and experiences 
we believe clients for whom we have helped realize cost savings or return on investment are likely to realize the economic benefit potential from our solutions and will be more likely to engage us in follow on programs 
focus on additional business opportunities in the commercial sector historically  we have served both government and commercial clients 
in recent years  we have successfully provided our operations management solutions primarily to the government sector 
however  due to uncertainties and recent changes with our government contracts and our overall growth strategy  we are dedicated to growing our commercial client base and will focus on the development of business in the commercial sector 
clients historically  most of our clients have been large  diversified commercial or government enterprises in north america  europe  and asia 
during the last four years  however  our engagements have involved primarily various government entities 
we have also served international clients in previous years from our former offices in switzerland  sweden  germany  singapore  china and hong kong 
currently  we are focused on delivering our solutions in north america 
in some instances  we provide solutions to the same organization under separate contract agreements 
while we believe our methodologies are applicable to any industry  we have developed a significant amount of subject matter expertise relevant to specific industries  including automotive  aviation  distribution  government  healthcare  manufacturing  semiconductor  textiles and transportation 
consequently  we can leverage our resultants prior executive experiences to obtain business and determine appropriate client project teams

we are compensated for our professional services and solutions in one or more of three ways fixed fees  task based fees  or incentive fees 
the majority of our revenue is derived from fixed fee and task based fee contracts 
our fee type and structure for each client engagement is dependent on a number of variables  including size of the client  the complexity and geographic dispersion of its business  the level of the opportunity for us to improve the client s processes and other factors 
our contracts are generally cancellable by the client upon days notice 
historically  we have worked in several divisions of the navy  each governed by a separate contractual agreement 
contracts related to these engagements are executed within the united states government s budget cycle and are fully funded for up to one year at a time and may be renewed annually for successive one year periods over the remaining life of the engagement 
for our engagements with the navy  we contract either directly with the government through our listing with the general services administration  or gsa  or we use an intermediary that acts as a prime contractor providing contracting and administrative services for the majority of our government programs 
we utilize caci  inc federal  a wholly owned subsidiary of caci international  inc  or caci  as an intermediary 
in these instances  caci plays a limited role in contract execution  and does not provide any client consulting services 
in the spring of  we learned that the government was formally moving to combine many of our us navy programs into one contracting vehicle using a competitive request for proposal 
based on our consistent delivery of results  access to multiple contracting vehicles  and the strength of our bidding team s major incumbents  we assessed the risk of an adverse outcome of not being able to procure our government programs through this or other contracting vehicles as low 
in january  we learned that we and the team with which we were partnered were not named as a provider under the new fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle 
although this meant we would not be able to contract to provide services for our two largest government programs through the fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle  we believed that we would continue to perform services for these programs at reduced volumes through existing government contracting vehicles that we already possess or new contracts we could obtain 
we now believe that there is a high likelihood that we will not continue to provide services for these programs in significant volume beyond april and there can be no assurances we will be able to replace these programs revenues 
fixed fee revenue is recognized on the proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
in order to calculate the completion ratio on a given project  time and effort to date are divided by the total estimated time and effort for the entire project 
this ratio is then multiplied by the total fixed fee to be earned on the project  resulting in the amount of revenue earned to date 
a few of our fixed fee contracts  primarily assessments  are recognized using the completed contract performance model as these contracts are generally one to six weeks in duration and conclude with a presentation or agreed upon deliverable to the clients management 
revenues attributable to fixed fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
task based fees are recognized as revenue when the relevant task is completed 
revenues attributable to task based fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
incentive fees are tied to improvements in a variety of client performance measures typically involving cycle time  asset utilization and productivity 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related client improvements are achieved and we obtain the client s acceptance 
our incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis for the payment of incentive fees 
in order to mitigate the risk of disputes arising over the achievement of performance improvements  which drive incentive fees  we obtain customer agreement to these achievements prior to recognizing revenue 
incentive fees are affected by our clients business performance and prevailing economic conditions 
revenues attributable to incentive fees were  for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of march   we had one contractual agreement for incentive fees 
reimbursement revenue represents our clients repayment of our mutually agreed upon travel expenses as incurred 
all billable travel expenses are submitted to and approved by the client 
revenues attributable to reimbursement were  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in our business under commitment  also known as backlog  we include signed client contracts and funded government contract commitments with terms generally ranging from three months to one year 
in and  a portion of our backlog included projects that were funded as a specific line item in the united states government s budget  as opposed to inclusion in a general category 
budgeting in this manner was considered equivalent to full funding  therefore  these commitments are included in backlog 
backlog at december  was million  all of which is expected to be realized in backlog at december  and was million and million  respectively 
financial information about segments and geographic areas financial information about our segments and information related to the geographic areas in which we operate appears in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
competition the consulting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
we compete with a large number of diverse service providers  including business operations consulting firms  such as huron consulting group  financial consulting firms  such as fti consulting  inc  management consulting firms  such as mckinsey company and booz allen hamilton  accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
in addition  since there are relatively low barriers to entry into the consulting services market  we expect new entrants into our operations management consulting field to result in continued and additional future competition 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs  industry expertise  and name recognition than we do 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and solutions  either of which could harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors 
our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies are trade secrets not capable of being patented  and there can be no assurance our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
therefore  there can be no assurance we will not be subject to competition from others using substantially similar methodologies 
however  we believe our competitive strengths differentiate us from competitors 
employees at december   we had a total of employees  consisting of full time resultants  part time resultants  sales and marketing employees and administrative employees 
our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we are highly selective in our hiring of resultants 
we recruit primarily experienced professionals with operational expertise 
we believe these highly sought after professionals choose to work for us because of the credentials  experience and reputation of our resultants  the opportunity to work on a diverse range of matters and our strong reputation 
we also develop and support our resultants in their career progression through training and development programs designed to match the skill sets of our resultants with the needs of our clients 
we believe our attractiveness as an employer is reflected in our low turnover rate among resultants 
our compensation plan includes competitive base salary  incentives and benefits 
the compensation and corporate governance committee of our board of directors  at its discretion  determines the incentives to be granted to our officers and our equity based compensation offered to any of our employees 
our chief executive officer and senior management determine performance compensation for our resultants  commissions for our sales professionals and any other non equity incentives granted to employees 
we have entered into nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees 
there can be no assurance the agreements will deter any of our employees from disclosing confidential information to third parties or from using such information to compete with us in the future 
intellectual property we are dedicated to providing industry leading operations and process improvement solutions to our clients and fostering a culture of continuous learning for our resultants 
our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies have been developed at great expense  have required considerable effort on the part of skilled professionals and are considered trade secrets 
therefore  only in certain circumstances will we grant clients a limited license to make internal use of certain of our proprietary methodologies 
we maintain our trade secrets in strict confidence and include nondisclosure provisions as part of our standard engagement 
despite our efforts to protect proprietary trade secrets from unauthorized use or disclosure  such as use of nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees  our current or former employees or others may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our trade secrets 
since our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies and solutions are trade secrets not capable of being patented  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or that our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
we have secured federal registration for the service marks total cycle time and tct 
these registrations expire from august to may we have secured federal service mark registration for several other marks important to our business 
we have also made appropriate filings in several european countries securing protection of our marks in those countries 
we consider each of these service marks to be significant to our business

item a 
risk factors 
risk factors we derive a portion of our revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process 
if we are unable to win new awards consistently over any extended period  our business could be adversely affected 
a portion of our contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process 
the competitive bidding process increases competition and pricing pressure  and we may be required to decrease our profit margins on our professional services and solutions in order to win a contract over our competitors 
if we are unable to win new contract awards consistently over any extended period or if the proportion of our contracts obtained through a competitive bidding process increases  our business will be adversely affected and cause our results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services and solutions of the type provided by the contract  there may be a competitive re bidding process 
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
the termination or non renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated 
we recently failed to win a competitive bid for future work under a us navy program that previously comprised a large portion of our business 
if we are unable to replace that business  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in the spring of  we learned that the government was formally moving to combine many of our us navy programs into one contracting vehicle using a competitive request for proposal 
based on our consistent delivery of results  access to multiple contracting vehicles  and the strength of our bidding team s major incumbents  we assessed the risk of an adverse outcome of not being able to procure our government programs through this or other contracting vehicles as low 
in january  we learned that we and the team with which we were partnered were not named as a provider under the new fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle 
although this meant we would not be able to contract to provide services for our two largest government programs through the fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle  we believed that we would continue to perform services for these programs at reduced volumes through existing government contracting vehicles that we already possess or new contracts we could obtain 
we now believe that there is a high likelihood that we will not continue to provide services for these programs in significant volume beyond april and there can be no assurances we will be able to replace these programs revenues 
if we are unable to replace these programs with other sources of revenue  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we derive our revenue from a limited number of engagements and our revenue could be adversely affected by the loss of a significant client or the cancellation of a significant engagement 
historically we derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of engagements 
from year to year  revenue from one or more individual clients may exceed of our revenue for such period 
for example  revenue from projects with the united states navy navy totaled million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
if we lose any major clients or if any of our significant engagements is reduced in scope or cancelled  like the loss of our contracts with the navy  as discussed in the risk factor above  we would lose a significant amount of revenue 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year due to the specific engagement nature of our business 
a client accounting for a significant portion of our revenue in one year may not comprise a significant portion of our revenue in the following year due to completion of the project  early termination of the project or a reduction of the scope of our engagement in the following year 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from government client engagements and this exposes us to various risks inherent in government contracts and the government contracting process 
we perform work for various government entities and agencies 
as a result  our business is susceptible to special risks inherent in government contracts and the government contracting process  including the following government entities fund projects annually through congressionally appropriated monies pursuant to the government budgeting cycle beginning on october of each year 
while our government engagements are often planned and executed as multi year projects  the initial contract term is typically one year or less  running through the next september after the contract is signed  and contains options to annually extend the term through the end of the project 
extensions are generally awarded each october through the end of the project in conjunction with the government budgeting cycle 
our government clients reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects with limited notice for lack of approved funding and at their convenience 
occasionally  congressional approval for appropriations extends beyond october in such a case  we typically obtain short term extensions to fund the project until congressional approval is obtained 
our government clients reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts 
such an audit may result in prospective adjustments to previously agreed rates for our work and affect our future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with related or other government entities 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than commercial contracts 
the number and terms of new government contracts signed can be affected significantly by political and economic factors  such as pending elections and revisions to government tax policies 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of its accuracy  may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
we may have difficulty finding suitable professionals to enable us to comply with such regulations due to the unique experience qualifications for our resultants 
many of our government clients are affected by the timing and duration of military conflicts in which the united states is involved 
funds intended for future contract renewals could be re appropriated and may not be available for our services and solutions as a result of the fiscal needs of other areas of the military during times of conflict 
government personnel who make decisions with respect to the award of military and other government contracts move in and out of such decision making positions 
we must expend significant effort educating such decision makers about our business and capabilities  and developing and maintaining relationships with decision makers at appropriate levels within our client organizations 
if we fail to successfully identify  educate and maintain relationships with appropriate decision makers within our clients organizations  our ability to compete for new contracts  and therefore our business generally  may suffer 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entity involved  but also other related and unrelated government entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as discussed in the risk factor above  we were unable to renew our contracts with the navy  but we plan on continuing our relationships within the navy and pursuing any new business opportunities 
our engagements with clients may be terminated by our clients on short notice 
the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients without cause  with short notice typically days and without penalty 
when contracts are terminated unexpectedly  the costs associated with the lost revenue may not be reduced in a timely manner 
following an unexpected termination  we may not be able to rapidly deploy our resultants to other projects  which would result in under utilization of resources 
in addition  because much of our work is project based rather than recurring in nature  we may not be able to replace cancelled contracts and maintain our utilization rates with new business 
consequently  our revenue and results of operations in subsequent periods may be lower than expected 
failure to maintain strong relationships with our contracting intermediary could result in less favorable contract terms and a decline in our revenue 
historically  we have derived substantial revenue from government engagements in which we utilize a contracting intermediary  caci  inc federal  a wholly owned subsidiary of caci international  inc  or caci 
although we also contract directly with the federal government through our listing with the general services administration  we evaluate  on a project by project basis  whether to use an intermediary such as caci to act as a prime contractor and provide contracting and administrative services 
we expect to continue to use intermediaries as prime contractors for certain contracts when appropriate in the foreseeable future 
in such cases  we will enter into agreements with such intermediaries that define the terms of our arrangement such as payment terms and specific deliverables 
future terms with contracting intermediaries may be less favorable than the terms under which we currently operate 
financial difficulties of an intermediary could cause a delay in remission of government funds to us and force us to seek other intermediaries 
we enter into fixed  task based and incentive fee engagements with our clients and unexpected costs  delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions or performance improvements could make our contracts less profitable 
we charge for our professional services and solutions based on fixed fee arrangements  task based fees or incentive fees 
fixed fee contracts require us to price our contracts by estimating our expenditures in advance 
our ability to properly estimate the costs and timing for completing client projects is critical to the profitability of our fixed fee contracts 
task based contracts also require us to estimate our expenditures in advance  and an appropriate billing amount is assigned to each completed task or deliverable based on the estimated cost for each specific task 
incentive fees are based on client specific measures  such as the achievement of specified process improvements  cost reductions or designated goals 
we must estimate our costs to deliver such client specific measures and design the incentive calculation accordingly to achieve our desired profit margin 
our cost  pricing and margin estimates reflect our professional judgment regarding our costs and the efficiencies of our resultants and processes 
any increased or unexpected costs  delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions or performance improvements in connection with the performance of these engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  incentive fees are affected by the client s business performance and prevailing economic conditions  both of which are beyond our control  which may cause variability in revenue and profit margins earned on such contracts and may limit our ability to forecast future revenue 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and fluctuations in operating results could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in future quarters  operating results may be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock may decline 
factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include the beginning and ending of significant contracts during a quarter  the number  size and scope of our ongoing engagements  variations in the amount of revenue attributable to incentive fees  our ability to recruit and retain qualified professionals  the extent to which our resultants can be reassigned efficiently from one engagement to another  fluctuations in demand for our professional services and solutions resulting from budget cuts  project delays  cyclical downturns or similar events  the occurrence and duration of conflicts involving the united states military  which could cause delays or changes in program operations related to our government clients  clients decisions to divert resources to other projects  collectability of receivables  and reductions in the prices of services and solutions offered by our competitors 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
our profitability is largely a function of the fees we are able to charge for our services and solutions and the efficiency with which we are able to utilize our resultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services and solutions or an appropriate utilization rate for our resultants without corresponding cost reductions  our profitability will suffer 
pricing for our professional services and solutions is affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services and solutions  introduction of new services or solutions by us or our competitors  pricing policies of our competitors  and market demand for our services and solutions and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of our client engagements  unanticipated changes in the duration or scope of client engagements  our ability to transition resultants from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and solutions and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each area of expertise  and our ability to manage attrition 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve 
budgets for consulting services typically decrease during times of adverse economic conditions 
a decline in the level of business activity of our clients could affect our ability to secure new client engagements  increase the likelihood of existing client engagement contract cancellations and reduce our utilization rates  which would have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue and our operating results 
for example  during the general economic slowdown in and  our industry averaged an approximate decrease in revenue 
as a result  during the third quarter of through and including the third quarter of  we were not profitable 
economic downturns could cause some clients to reduce or defer their expenditures for consulting services 
we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives to manage our expenses as a percentage of revenue  however  current and future savings initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain our margins if the economic environment should weaken for a prolonged period 
the consulting services industry is highly competitive and actions by competitors could render our services and solutions less competitive  causing revenue and profit margin to decline 
the consulting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
we compete with a large number of diverse service providers  including business operations consulting firms  financial consulting firms  management consulting firms  accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
in addition  since there are relatively low barriers to entry into the consulting services market  we expect new entrants into our operations management consulting field to result in continued and additional future competition 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs  industry specific expertise and name recognition than we do 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and solutions  either of which could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to compete depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the prices at which others offer competitive services  including aggressive price competition and discounting on individual engagements  the ability of our competitors to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  the extent  if any  to which our competitors develop proprietary tools that improve their ability to compete  the ability of our clients and potential clients to perform the services themselves  and the extent of our competitors responsiveness to client needs 
we may not be able to compete effectively on these or other factors 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our market position  and therefore our revenue and results of operations  could decline 
if we are unable to attract  hire  develop  train and retain experienced resultants and sales professionals  our competitive position and financial performance could suffer 
our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services and solutions and our success depends upon the efforts  abilities and project execution of our business consultants  whom we call resultants 
our resultants have highly specialized skills 
if key resultants leave and we are unable to replace them with suitable candidates  we could experience difficulty in managing the affected client engagements 
professionals with requisite credentials and experience qualified to be our resultants are in great demand and we face significant competition for these professionals from our competitors  academic institutions  government entities  research firms and other organizations  including our clients 
in addition  we rely on our sales professionals to develop business opportunities and client relationships 
we face significant competition for these sales professionals from our competitors 
competing employers for both resultants and sales professionals may be able to offer greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
typically  our resultants have close relationships with the clients they serve 
our agreements with our clients typically include non solicitation arrangements 
if a client hires one of our resultants in violation of the non solicitation provisions  we will consider any legal remedies we may have on a case by case basis 
however  we may decide preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with our clients  or other concerns  outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recovery 
therefore  we may determine not to pursue legal action 
furthermore  our employment agreements with our employees  including resultants and sales professionals  typically include non competition provisions 
however  many states  including texas  generally interpret non competition clauses narrowly 
therefore  if a resultant or salesperson leaves and goes into business in competition with us or joins a competitor  we may not have reasonably available legal recourse and our client relationships could suffer 
our inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain resultants or sales professionals could limit our ability to accept or complete engagements and adversely affect our competitive position and financial performance 
it may be difficult for us to differentiate the professional services and solutions we offer to our clients from those offered by our competitors 
many of our competitors offer consulting services of a nature similar to those provided by our resultants 
although we strive to differentiate our services and solutions by using experienced professionals to deliver improvements using our proprietary pvm approach  there can be no guarantee potential clients will find such differentiation persuasive 
if we cannot effectively differentiate our services and solutions from those offered by our competitors  our sales efforts could be adversely affected  and therefore our revenue and our results of operations could decline 
we must continually enhance our services and solutions to meet the changing needs of our clients or face the possibility of losing future business to competitors 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing services and solutions and to introduce new services and solutions to meet the requirements of our clients in a rapidly developing and evolving market 
for example  certain clients may require a different methodology from what our resultants typically utilize 
in such cases  we may have to train our resultants to utilize different methodologies 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs and expertise in certain methodologies than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in client requirements 
if we are unable to anticipate or respond adequately to our clients needs  our revenue could decline and our results of operations could suffer 
maintaining our reputation is critical to our future success 
we have invested significant time and resources in building our reputation and name recognition 
our ability to gain market acceptance of the thomas group brand and to secure new engagements depends heavily on our reputation and our ability to provide high quality  reliable and cost effective services and solutions 
some of our engagements come from former or existing clients or from referrals by former or existing clients 
consequently  if we fail to perform our services and solutions in a manner meeting our clients expectations  our reputation may be damaged and our ability to attract new business or new resultants  our competitive position and our results of operations could suffer 
if we are unable to grow or if we fail to manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business successfully our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected 
any failure on our part to grow or to manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business successfully could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect over time to grow our operations by expanding into other areas of the government and by strengthening our position in the commercial sector 
expanding our position in these areas will likely require extensive management attention and may increase our overall selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also may expand by hiring additional resultants  either individually or as members of existing groups  or acquiring complementary businesses 
alternatively  from time to time  we may need to take labor force resizing actions to account for fluctuations in the level of our business 
these activities could result in the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company 
we also could encounter difficulties in integrating persons from other firms with diverse professional backgrounds  experiences and organizational cultures into our own organization 
expansion creates new and increased management and training responsibilities for our employees 
expansion also increases demands on our internal systems  procedures and controls and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
if we do not manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and damage our reputation 
our engagements typically address complex business challenges which require us to exercise professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
if a client questions the quality of our work  the client could bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities and  regardless of the merits or outcome  could be very costly and could distract our management and damage our reputation 
although our engagement agreements typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims  they may not protect us under some circumstances 
in addition  we carry professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims  but policy limits and breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of our legal defense 
for example  we provide services and solutions on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
liability in excess of our insurance limits would have to be borne directly by us and could seriously harm our profitability  financial position and reputation 
inability to protect intellectual property could harm our competitive position and financial performance 
we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which are important to our success 
our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies are trade secrets not capable of being patented  and there can be no assurance our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary trade secrets from unauthorized use or disclosure  such as use of nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees  our current or former employees or others may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our trade secrets 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary trade secrets may not prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect intellectual property rights as fully as in the united states 
the unauthorized use of our trade secrets or use of substantially similar methodologies and solutions by our competitors or others could harm our competitive position and financial performance 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  if we are unable to timely complete our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest to our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence and the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively detect and prevent fraud 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which we refer to as section  under currently published sec rules  beginning with our fiscal year ended december   we are required to perform an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose the assessment in our annual report on form k for the year ending december  attestation by our auditor will be required for the year ended december  we dedicated significant management  financial and other resources in connection with our compliance with section in these efforts included a review of our existing internal control structure 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls and do not address any deficiencies that may be identified by our auditors  we may not be able to conclude  on an ongoing basis  that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act of moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
as a result  our failure to satisfy the requirements of section on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
operating internationally exposes us to special risks and factors that could negatively impact our business or operations and could result in increased expenses and declining profit margin 
we currently operate primarily in the united states and have minimal operations in asia and europe  however  in the future  we may expand our international operations 
if our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense associated with establishing and maintaining our international operations  our results of operations could suffer 
international operations create special risks  including the following local legal and regulatory requirements  such as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs and foreign taxes  sanctions  data privacy laws and labor regulations  may impair our ability to operate efficiently or expatriate foreign profits  enforcing agreements with clients and collecting accounts receivable may be more difficult in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign intellectual property laws may make enforcement of our intellectual property rights in foreign countries more difficult  increased competition from local consultants may hamper our marketing and sales opportunities in certain locations  general economic and political conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our earnings from operations in those countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  may affect demand for our services and solutions and may adversely affect the profitability in united states dollars of services and solutions provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our services is made in the local currency  and more burdensome employee benefit requirements may impair our ability to maintain appropriate gross profit margins 
we may not pay dividends 
the determination of future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictive covenants in our credit facility  future business prospects and any other matters that our board of directors deems relevant 
there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
we may need additional capital in the future  and this capital may not be available to us 
the raising of additional capital may dilute stockholders ownership in us 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to expand our international operations  develop new services and solutions  respond to competitive pressures  or pursue strategic acquisitions 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute stockholders ownership percentage in us 
we believe that existing cash resources  the amounts available under our credit facility and cash generated from current operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash needs at least through december  any future decreases in our operating income  cash flow  or stockholders equity may impair our future ability to raise additional funds to finance operations 
any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  stockholder rights plan  delaware law and arrangements we have with certain significant stockholders may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan which could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding stock 
we have entered into an agreement with two of our directors and significant stockholders  general john t 
chain  jr 
and mr 
edward p 
evans  which grants general chain the right to designate three nominees to our board of directors as long he owns greater than of our outstanding common stock and mr 
evans the right to designate two nominees to our board of directors as long as he owns greater than of our outstanding common stock 
these contractual obligations could make it difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors in the event of an acquisition 
in addition  these directors and significant stockholders currently have and may continue to have a significant ownership interest in our common stock which could make it difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock

we may become subject to various claims and other legal matters  such as collection matters initiated by us in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
we believe neither such claims and legal matters nor the cost of prosecuting and or defending such claims and legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
no material claims are currently pending  however  no assurances can be given that future claims  if any  may not be material

overview we are an operations and process improvement services firm headquartered in irving  texas that provides process improvement solutions that enhance business efficiency  competitiveness and financial performance 
we develop and employ methodologies to transform the processes  procedures and people within our clients organizations to enable more efficient and seamless operations 
our methodologies address business processes throughout the extended enterprise 
extended enterprise is a term we use to describe the full spectrum of a client s value chain from its suppliers  through its internal operations  and to its customers 
as specialists in operations and process improvement  we create and implement process improvement solutions that remove barriers  increase productivity  improve cultures and enable our clients to improve and sustain operational performance as measured by the following total cycle time  time to market  delivering lead times  operational and administrative productivity  cost savings  product yields  inventory turns  and return on assets 
to deliver these solutions  we utilize our staff of professionals  whom we refer to as resultants  who average over years of business experience 
to manage our client engagements  our resultants typically leverage our process value management  or pvm  approach  which incorporates our proprietary total cycle time  or tct  methodology along with other industry accepted process improvement methodologies 
pvm is used to manage client engagements  identify process inefficiencies and implement change within our clients in order to achieve a total transformation to what we refer to as the process managed enterprise 
a process managed enterprise is one in which management focus and systems are centered on customers and managed around processes 
historically  most of our clients have been large  diversified commercial or government enterprises in north america  europe  and asia 
during the last four years  however  our engagements have involved primarily various government entities 
we have also served international clients in previous years from our former offices in switzerland  sweden  germany  singapore  china and hong kong 
currently  we are focused on delivering our solutions in north america 
in some instances  we provide solutions to the same organization under separate contract agreements 
while we believe our methodologies are applicable to any industry  we have developed a significant amount of subject matter expertise relevant to specific industries  including automotive  aviation  distribution  government  healthcare  manufacturing  semiconductor  textiles and transportation 
we generally derive our revenue from fees for the implementation of business operations improvement programs delivered by our resultants 
total revenue consists of fees and other billings derived from fixed fees  task based fees  incentive fees and reimbursed travel expenses 
our fee type and structure for each client engagement is dependant on a number of variables  including the size of the client  the complexity and geographic dispersion of its business  the level of the opportunity for us to improve the client s processes and other factors 
fixed fee revenue is recognized on the proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
in order to calculate the completion ratio on a given project  time and effort to date are divided by the total estimated time and effort for the entire project 
this ratio is then multiplied by the total fixed fee to be earned on the project  resulting in the amount of revenue earned to date 
a few of our fixed fee contracts  primarily assessments  are recognized using the completed contract performance model as these contracts are generally one to six weeks in duration and conclude with a presentation or agreed upon deliverable to the clients management 
revenues attributable to fixed fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
task based fees are recognized as revenue when the relevant task is completed 
revenues attributable to task based fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
incentive fees are tied to improvements in a variety of client performance measures typically involving cycle time  asset utilization and productivity 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related client improvements are achieved and we obtain the client s acceptance 
our incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis for the payment of incentive fees 
in order to mitigate the risk of disputes arising over the achievement of performance improvements  which drive incentive fees  we obtain customer agreement to these achievements prior to recognizing revenue 
incentive fees are affected by our clients business performance and prevailing economic conditions 
revenues attributable to incentive fees were  for each of the years ended december    and as of march   we had one contractual agreement for incentive fees 
reimbursement revenue represents the client s repayment of our mutually agreed upon travel expenses as incurred 
all billable travel expenses are submitted to and approved by the client 
revenues attributable to reimbursement were  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cost of sales represents the direct costs involved in providing services and solutions to our clients 
the components include  but are not limited to  direct labor and benefit costs  support costs such as telecommunications and computer costs  travel costs and other costs incurred in providing services and solutions to our clients 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of all labor and other goods and services necessary for our selling and marketing efforts  human resource support  accounting and finance services  legal and other professional services  facilities and equipment  information technology and telecommunications support and services  and other corporate functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization on the fixed assets used to support these functions 
sublease losses and income arose from the sublease contracts we maintained with subtenants in our reston  va and troy  mi offices 
losses are generally the result of a subtenant defaulting on a lease or at the termination of a lease in which we anticipate that the future subtenant income will not be sufficient to recoup our costs associated with the subleased office space 
sublease income is recognized generally upon the termination of a sublease in which we  as a result of the termination  are able to avoid future anticipated costs previously recognized as sublease losses 
as of december   we no longer maintain any sublease contracts 
on december   we adopted a policy under which we would pay an aggregate annual cash dividend of on each outstanding share of common stock  payable quarterly at a rate of per share 
on june   our board of directors amended our dividend policy to increase the annual dividend to per share  payable quarterly at a rate of per share 
on december   we revised our dividend policy to provide for an increased annual cash dividend of per share  payable quarterly at a rate of per share

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when realizable and earned generally as services and solutions are provided over the life of a contract 
fixed fee revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
task based  or deliverable based  fees are recognized when the relevant task or deliverable is completed 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related improvements are achieved 
our incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis of our incentive fees earned 
we do not recognize incentive fee revenue until the client has agreed that performance improvements have in fact been achieved 
unbilled receivables although fixed fee revenue recognition generally coincides with billings  as an accommodation to our clients  we may structure fee billings to increase in the latter stages of a program 
in such instances  amounts collectible for services and solutions provided but not yet billed are represented in unbilled receivables 
deferred taxes income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method required by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences resulting from timing differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
these timing differences are associated with differences between the financial and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
under fas no 
 a statutory change in tax rates will be recognized immediately in deferred taxes and income 
net deferred taxes are recorded both as a current deferred income tax asset and as other long term liabilities based upon the classification of the related timing difference 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered when determining the need for a valuation allowance 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in accordance with sfas no 
 evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
in addition to timing differences arising from operating assets and liabilities  we also record deferred tax assets for the tax benefits of net operating losses and foreign tax credits 
for united states federal tax purposes  at december   we had net operating loss nol carryovers of approximately million 
under the section limitation  discussed below  million was used to offset united states taxable income in in  million expired under section  but an million in united states net operating loss was generated  resulting in a balance of million at december  in  we used million of the net operating loss to offset united states taxable income and used million of the net operating loss carryforward limited under section  resulting in a net operating loss carryforward balance of million at december  in each of fiscal years and  we used million of the net operating loss carryforward balance  resulting in a million and million balance at december  and december   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during  however  we determined that a valuation allowance was only appropriate on approximately  of the nol carryforward  due to annual limitations under section  and therefore  we removed million of the valuation allowance 
there were no valuation adjustments in if future analyses of the positive and negative evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized  a partial or full valuation allowance may be required  which could have a negative on net income in the period that it becomes more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized

government contracts in the spring of  we learned that the government was formally moving to combine many of our us navy programs into one contracting vehicle using a competitive request for proposal 
based on our consistent delivery of results  access to multiple contracting vehicles  and the strength of our bidding team s major incumbents  we assessed the risk of an adverse outcome of not being able to procure our government programs through this or other contracting vehicles as low 
in january  we learned that we and the team with which we was partnered were not named as a provider under the new fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle 
although this meant we would not be able to contract to provide services for our two largest government programs through the fleet readiness enterprise contracting vehicle  we believed that we would continue to perform services for these programs at reduced volumes through existing government contracting vehicles that we already possess or new contracts we could obtain 
we now believe that there is a high likelihood that we will not continue to provide services for these programs in significant volume beyond april and there can be no assurances we will be able to replace these programs revenues 
in light of this new assessment  we are adjusting our selling efforts and taking steps intended to strengthen our ability to generate new government business in other areas of the us navy and the department of defense 
we are diligently working to replace these programs with revenues from other areas of the us navy 
we are also considering measures intended to reduce costs in the event we are unable to continue or replace the affected us navy programs

during  however  we determined that a valuation allowance was only appropriate on approximately  of the nol carryforward  due to annual limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and therefore  we removed million of the valuation allowance 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance of approximately  against our net deferred tax assets against net operating loss carryforwards subject to annual limitation under section while the factors listed above were considered in assessing the sufficiency of a valuation allowance  there is no assurance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would not need to be made in the future if information about future years change 
any change in the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made

our liquidity plan our ability to generate cash from operations is due primarily to our ability to generate revenue  cost saving measures such as downsizing and subleasing facilities  and more aggressive collection policies 
our ability to maintain gross margins  control costs and generate cash flow from operations in the future will determine our ability manage our debt facilities and to remain in future compliance with debt covenants

we believe the bank debt facility described above provides adequate liquidity based on our current growth strategies and cost control measures 
we also believe cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to service debt payments as they become due 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe inflation had a material effect on the results of operations during the years ended december   or however  there can be no assurance our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

our credit agreement provides for borrowings  which bear interest at the prime rate  or libor plus  if elected 
since january   the prime rate has fluctuated between and and the year libor rate has fluctuated between and 
based on the volatility of the prime rate in recent years  a five percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in of additional interest expense in through march   we had no borrowings or repayments on our revolving line of credit 
the outstanding balance at march  was due to our foreign operations in asia and europe  we are exposed to transaction adjustments with respect to foreign currency 
our functional currency is the united states dollar 
under united states dollar functional currency  the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are remeasured from the recording currency to the united states dollar 
the resulting remeasurement adjustment is recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of operations 
there is no translation adjustment to the separate component of stockholders equity or adjustment to comprehensive income 
we incurred foreign exchange losses of and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
due to liquidating the hong kong office during  there is no interest rate risk at december  at december   we had no exposure to the euro related to our operations in europe 
at december   the effect of a increase in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a foreign currency exchange loss on our non united states denominated assets and a foreign exchange gain on the company s non united states denominated liabilities 
as such  the net effect of a increase in the company s foreign exchange rates  at december   would have been a foreign currency exchange loss 
the company believes that operating under united states dollar functional currency  combined with transacting business in countries with traditionally stable currencies mitigates the effect of any near term foreign currency transaction adjustments on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the company have any derivative financial instruments 
however  going forward  the company will assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates
