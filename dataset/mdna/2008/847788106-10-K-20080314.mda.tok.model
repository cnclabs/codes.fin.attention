item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
also  additional information on the company s revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
the company sponsors and promotes outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
significant growth in our revenues will depend  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as further described in capital expenditures below  the company has several capital projects underway at each of its speedways 
management does not believe the company s financial performance has been materially affected by inflation  and has generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
results of operations the company s revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues

earnings or losses on equity investees primarily includes the company s share of its motorsports authentics merchandising joint venture equity investee profits or losses 
the company s revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of tsi  legends cars  oil chem  smi trackside  mbm  bulk petroleum transactions  oil and gas exploration and production activities  or other operating revenues 
the company classifies expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting revenues  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to nascar for associated events held at the company s speedways

all of the company s  and several of its  nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event sponsorships are already sold  and pre sales for other corporate event related revenues are showing similar trends 
almost million fans attended the company s events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained strong even in challenging circumstances 
for the company s upcoming events  tickets are essentially sold out for bms s and lvms s march sprint cup events 
ticket sales at nhms are above  and at ams  ir  lms and tms are slightly below or below  ticket sales at this same time last year 
however  at this early date  management is unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated 
rising fuel prices  volatile interest rates  and difficult consumer credit and housing markets  among other geopolitical and economic factors  may continue to dampen consumer spending 
natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita could cause further increases in fuel prices and significant adverse economic effects 
the national incidents of september   along with the iraq war and terrorism alerts  continue to affect public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
economic conditions could be severely affected by future actual or threatened events of a similar nature or other national  regional or local incidents  which could materially adversely affect the company s future operating results 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions surrounding racing events can have a negative effect on successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
these factors affect consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
the company believes that reduced consumer spending impacted admissions and the demand for souvenir  apparel and other merchandise  with related effects on event related and other operating revenues 
while management believes the company s strong operating cash flow will continue  economic conditions  rising fuel prices  competitiveness of racing  popularity of drivers and teams for nascar s sprint cup series  and the success of nascar s car of tomorrow can affect ticket  corporate marketing  sponsorships and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  similar to past years  management again decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices in to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for the company s core business 
a substantial portion of the company s profit growth in recent years  notwithstanding  has resulted from a significant increase in television revenues received from nascar contracts with various television networks 
nascar ratings can impact attendance at company events and sponsorship opportunities 
the former six year nascar domestic television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx expired after nascar has announced new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series events for through nascar also announced these agreements have an approximate billion contract period value  representing approximately million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and a increase over the former contract annual average of million 
the announced total nascar broadcasting rights fees for the entire industry approximated million and  although initially lower than the rights fees of approximately million  this eight year arrangement provides us with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
the company s nascar broadcasting revenues were million  reflecting a decrease of approximately million or from these lower revenues were partially offset by a decrease in associated contracted nascar purse and sanction fees of approximately million or 
the company s total contracted nascar broadcasting revenues  based on the current race schedule including nhms  are approximately million 
management believes this long term contracted revenue source helps solidify the company s financial strength  stabilize earnings and cash flows  and bodes well for the future of smi and the motorsports industry 
management also believes these new contracts have long term strategic benefits 
for instance  over the past several speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k years  major sports programming has begun to shift between network and cable 
cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which is resulting in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
however  cable reaches fewer households than network broadcasts 
nascar s decision to retain approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television is believed to be important to the sport s future growth  and should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three nascar racing series  which should help increase long term attendance and corporate marketing appeal 
management believes espn s involvement should result in the nationwide series benefiting from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn  and motorsports in general should benefit from increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to that espn provides with the other major sports 
future changes in race schedules would impact broadcasting revenues 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the company s share of the television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis 
purchase of new hampshire speedway and amendment of bank credit facility on january   the company purchased of the outstanding stock of new hampshire speedway  inc  d b a new hampshire international speedway  for million in cash 
the new hampshire international speedway is being renamed new hampshire motor speedway 
nhms owns and operates a multi use complex located in loudon  new hampshire  featuring a mile oval superspeedway and a mile road course on approximately  acres 
nhms currently has approximately  premium permanent seats and luxury suites 
nhms has sanction agreements to host two nascar sprint cup and one nascar nationwide series race in  among other events and track rentals 
the purchase of nhms expands the company s motorsports business into one of the largest media markets in north america 
management believes its facilities and racing events provide the company with opportunities for increasing revenues and profitability 
the purchase price was funded with available cash and million in borrowings under the amended credit facility as further described below 
management anticipates that increased debt interest payments and working capital requirements  if any  for nhms will be largely funded by advance ticket and other event related revenues associated with upcoming nascar and other racing events at nhms 
the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method  and the results of operations after acquisition will be included in the company s consolidated statements of income 
in and future years  the company plans to make various improvements at nhms  including possible expansion of concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities 
these improvements may involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
on january   the company amended its credit facility to increase the amount available for borrowing under revolving loans from million to million  and to specifically exclude the nhms purchase from the provision that aggregate cash consideration for the company s motorsports industry related transactions in any fiscal year could not exceed of its consolidated net worth at the immediately preceding fiscal year end 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s credit facility 
motorsports authentics joint venture the company and isc equally own a joint venture formed in august that operates independently under the name motorsports authentics to produce  market and sell exclusive and non exclusive licensed motorsports collectible and consumer products 
ma has license agreements with many of the top nascar  irl  and nhra teams and drivers

as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company uses the equity method of accounting for its ownership in ma 
the fiscal operating results of ma include sizable impairment charges for inventory  tooling  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these charges were due primarily to several nascar driver  team and sponsor changes  including dale earnhardt  jr  a material ma licensor  renaming of the nascar nextel cup and busch series in  nascar s introduction of the car of tomorrow  car manufacturer changes  other excess merchandise inventory and tooling no longer used for a secondary product line 
the company s share of these ma charges approximated million for reduction of inventory and tooling to estimated net recoverable value and million for reduction of ma s business net assets to estimated fair value 
the impact of ma s results on the company s net income and diluted earnings per share is presented above in item selected financial data  motorsports authentics joint venture equity investment and speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k non gaap financial information reconciliation

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ma continues to have a material amount of inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets and the company s share of future associated profits or losses may or may not be significant 
future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports  the popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s sprint cup series  the success of the car of tomorrow  competition for ma products  and the success of ma management in achieving sustained profitability 
the company may increase its investment in ma  including additional equity contributions or loans 
ma s ability to compete successfully and profitably depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
the company s current and future carrying value of this equity investment could become impaired for changes in profitability  operating cash flows  market and economic conditions  and other factors that could adversely impact recovery 
should future ma inventory or long lived assets become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge  the company would be required to record its share which could have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
also  should the fair value of the company s equity investment in ma decline below its carrying value  and such decline was other than temporary  the company would be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to fair value  which could have a material adverse impact on its future financial condition or results of operations

non event and event souvenir and other merchandising revenues management is developing new merchandising opportunities  including expanded product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and marketing of motorsports and non motorsports related souvenir merchandise at our speedways  third party speedways and other venues  and with corporate customers 
the company s merchandising event related and other operating revenues may increase or decrease depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts 
future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports and popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s sprint cup series  the success of the car of tomorrow  and competition for the company s non event products and outside venues 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
such changes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse impact on the outcome of management s realization assessment and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on provisions reflected for receivable and inventory realization assessments 
oil and gas activities and plans to discontinue operations the company has engaged in oil and gas exploration and production activities  and the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products and associated commodity transactions 
the company has conducted these business activities primarily in russia  central america  north america  south america  kuwait  africa  and the united kingdom 
oasis trading group llc oasis  a united states company  provides the company strategic  management and operational capabilities in connection with these activities

at times  the company enters into futures contracts associated with petroleum products  utilizes letters of credit for the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products  and guarantees obligations of certain third parties to facilitate the purchase of bulk petroleum products in exchange for part of the anticipated profits that may be derived by those third parties on such transactions 
the company also had profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain foreign entities on the purchasing and selling of specified bulk petroleum products  and the company s share of profits and losses is negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis  but generally ranges from to 
purchases  sales  bulk petroleum  oil and gas activities  futures contracts  and letters of credit hereafter are collectively associated with or referred to as oil and gas activities  oil and gas business  oil and gas transactions or bulk petroleum transactions 
in may  the company formed speedway motorsports international limited bvi smil  a wholly owned sub speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k sidiary of oil chem  to conduct oil and gas exploration and production activities  and possibly expand into asia  the middle east and other foreign regions

capitalized expenditures for oil and gas exploration and production activities  including acquisition related costs  amounted to million in see note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to legal actions affecting or involving visheraneft  one of the entities owning certain mineral rights the company purchased 
while management believes the outcome of legal actions affecting visheraneft should be resolved in the company s favor  an unfavorable outcome of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on its future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from oil and gas transactions are included in other operating revenue and other direct operating expense  respectively 
operating profits or losses associated with energy supply contracts are reported on a net basis in other operating revenue 
there were no oil and gas transactions reported on a gross basis in or for oil and gas transactions reported on a gross basis during  revenues totaled approximately million 
there were no energy supply contract related oil and gas transactions reported on a net basis in for oil and gas transactions reported on a net basis  associated billings totaled approximately million in and million in  and associated profits  excluding recovery allowances  amounted to million in and million in there were no significant revenues from russian oil and gas exploration and production activities in or  and associated operating costs were not significant 
the company was not involved in any energy supply contracts as of december  notwithstanding these oil and gas activities  the company s core business has been and remains motorsports 
management recognizes that this oil and gas business has financial and operational risks different from those of our core operations 
many are risks ordinarily experienced by any new business  risks ordinarily associated with conducting business in foreign countries  as well as risks generally associated with petroleum products  commodities  oil and gas activities  hedging and similar transactions of this nature 
however  the company s oil and gas activities involve concentrations of credit and other risks different from motorsports operations as of december  these credit and other risks are further described above in part i item a risk factors our oil and gas business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of our other operations  and below in critical accounting policies and accounting estimates recoverability of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  and equity investments in associated entities 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has credit risk concentration in receivables associated with bulk petroleum sales and purchase transactions 
as of december   approximately million of net accounts receivable are due from a relatively small number of petroleum industry customers and merchants in russia and central america 
also  from time to time  bulk petroleum inventory products may be located in and managed by a relatively small number of vendors in central america or russia 
as of december   the company had  in outstanding standby letters of credit associated with oil and gas activities and no bulk petroleum product inventory 
as of december   uncertainty exists as to the recovery of million drawn by a bank under a company guarantee for obligations owed by certain third parties for petroleum product purchases utilizing their bank line of credit 
the bank claimed and took possession of funds for payment under the guarantee for non payment by the third parties  notwithstanding the company s belief that payment was not required nor rightfully drawn upon by the bank 
the company believes it has lawful recourse against the third parties and the bank  and is seeking recovery of the funds 
however  uncertainty exists as to ultimate recovery of the amount due  which is reflected in accounts receivable  and has been fully reserved as of december  a recovery allowance of million is reflected in other direct operating expense in this assessment is subjective and based on facts  circumstances and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  all of which are subject to significant change 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k at december   uncertainty exists as to the full realization of receivables due from two foreign entities and oasis under certain profit and loss sharing arrangements 
uncertainty exists about collecting amounts from two foreign entities because of problems with respect to access to funds  creditworthiness and certain other factors outside of management s control when conducting operations in foreign countries 
management is currently pursuing available recovery alternatives 
under its profit and loss sharing arrangement  the company has recorded receivables from oasis  a significant portion of which pertains to that entity s reimbursable share of loss associated with the recoverability assessment of amounts due from these two foreign entities 
oasis s ability to repay the company this or any future amount is largely dependent on sufficient profitability of future oil and gas activities  therefore  uncertainty exists regarding recoverability 
as of december   the company has recorded allowances for these possibly uncollectible amounts of approximately million based on estimated ultimate realization after possible recovery  settlement and other costs and insurance 
as of december   the company has recorded allowances for possible uncollectible amounts aggregating approximately million 
this amount includes recovery allowances of approximately million recorded in  which are reflected in other direct operating expense 
this assessment is subjective and based on facts  circumstances and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  all of which are subject to significant change 
such changes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse impact on the outcome of management s realization assessment and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in march  because of the ongoing challenges with oil and gas activities  the company is contemplating discontinuing those operations during  although no final decision has been made 
at this time  the company no longer plans to expand or increase its investment in connection with the two foreign entities or make other foreign investments except as described herein 
the company may decide or be required to spend certain additional amounts or take legal actions to protect or preserve its interests in oil and gas mineral rights and maintain or maximize the potential recovery value of proven and unproven reserves  and to protect other aspects of the company s oil and gas investments 
this may include entering into other contracts or joint venture arrangements depending on perceived opportunities for maintaining or maximizing potential recovery value 
such additional expenditures  although presently undeterminable  could become material depending on the facts  circum stances and ultimate outcome of any attempted recovery or resolution 
those costs  if significant and ultimately not recovered  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although discontinuation plans are being formulated  many or most of the following and other risk factor discussions remain relevant to the company s oil and gas business activities 
oil and gas transactions may continue to occur in the near future  and they may or may not be significant 
while revenues could become significant  resulting profit margins could be affected by market and other factors such as transaction  unrecoverable and other operating costs  and could be less than those on existing operations 
realization of receivables  inventories and investments  including property and equipment  and the ability to invest and compete successfully and profitably  are subject to many factors outside management s control 
factors that can adversely impact realization include changes or deterioration in customer financial condition and creditworthiness  current and future market demand  customary risks associated with oil and gas exploration and production and other business activities  regional and global market and economic conditions  elevated terrorism alerts  terrorist attacks or military actions including geopolitical situations in and surrounding specific countries or regions  government actions that restrict transactions  access to or transfers of assets or funds  other factors outside of management s control when conducting operations in russia and other foreign countries  global petroleum product supply and demand  regional or worldwide natural disasters such as hurricanes that adversely impact supply channels  merchandising  distribution and operating costs  and other factors 
default on payment by one or more customers  or should inventory not be realized or recovered  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
the company s oil and gas activities include exploration and production arrangements that may be unsuccessful for many reasons including weather  cost overruns  dry wells  equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties 
proven or unproven reserves may be less than originally expected or found not cost beneficial to extract 
successful drilling of a well does not ensure ultimate realization of sufficient profits or return on investments because of a variety of factors  including geological  market  geopolitical and other unforeseen factors 
additionally  unsuccessful wells can result in costs with no direct associated revenue streams 
the carrying value of current and future investments could become impaired from insufficient sustained profitability and operating cash flows resulting from the aforementioned and other factors 
such factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in an impairment charge that has a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations

lowe s motor speedway renovation and construction of new dragway the company s report on form q for the third quarter disclosed that management was contemplating relocation or renovation of lowe s motor speedway  including construction of a modern dragstrip 
after evaluation of various proposed initiatives to develop a new motorsports facility  the company decided to renovate lowe s motor speedway  including construction of a modern dragstrip  rather than relocate the speedway facilities 
renovation of lms will likely involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
earnings guidance in connection with the company s fourth quarter and full year earnings release  management provided full year guidance of per diluted share  assuming current industry and economic trends continue  and excluding the company s share of motorsports authentics joint venture operating results  non core businesses  capital expenditures exceeding current plans  the impact of further increases in fuel prices  interest rates  geopolitical conflicts  poor weather surrounding events and other unforeseen factors 
insurance coverage heightened concerns and challenges regarding property  casualty  liability  business interruption  and other insurance coverage have resulted from the national incidents on september   natural disasters and incidents such as the pedestrian bridge collapse at lms in the company has a material investment in property and equipment at each of its seven speedway facilities that are generally located near highly populated cities and hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical  and situational factors  among others  have resulted in significant increases in insurance premium costs  and further increases are possible 
while management believes it has reasonable limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  management cannot guarantee that such coverage would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur 
the occurrence of such an incident at any of the company s speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on its future financial position  results of operations or cash flows if asset damage and or its liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits 
the occurrence of additional incidents  and particularly incidents at sporting events  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair the company s ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
management cannot assure you that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact the company s profitability  thereby possibly impacting its operating results and growth 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with its speedway and other properties  and motorsports events and other business risks 
motorsports can be dangerous to participants and to spectators 
the company maintains insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in management s judgment  to protect from material financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by persons on our premises in the ordinary course of business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
the company may increase the marketing of certain products using self insured promotional warranty programs which could subject it to increased risk of loss should the number and amount of claims significantly increase 
also  as described in oil and gas activities above  the company has conducted oil and gas transactions for which customary insurance was obtained with experienced carriers 
while management believes it has reasonable limits of property  casualty  and liability insurance in force  including coverage for environmental pollution and loss of or damaged cargo  management cannot guarantee that such coverage would be adequate should a significant incident occur 
the occurrence of such an incident could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows if damages  losses and or its liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits 
the company has increased and may further increase its self insurance limits which could subject the company to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents  damages  casualties or other claims below such self insured limits increase 
while management believes it has reasonable self insurance limits in place  management cannot guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase 
an increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows

year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for decreased by million  or  from such revenues for due to the factors discussed below 
admissions for increased by million  or  over such revenue for essentially all of this increase is due speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k to higher overall attendance at nascar sanctioned racing events 
the increase reflects the continued growth in admissions at nascar sanctioned racing events held at bms  ir  lms and lvms in the overall increase was partially offset by the cancellation of tms s nascar sprint cup series qualifying and iroc racing event in the second quarter comparable racing events were held at tms in although largely similar to last year  management believes admission revenues at nascar sanctioned racing events held in the current period were negatively impacted by declines in consumer spending from high fuel prices  volatile interest rates and difficult consumer credit and housing markets 
event related revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for approximately of this increase is due to higher sponsorship  display advertising  camping  track rentals  radio broadcasting  luxury suite rentals  and other event related revenues associated with nascar sanctioned racing events as compared to last year 
the increase also reflects event related revenues associated with the opening of lvms s new infield media center  garage and fan zone entertainment facilities in in addition  souvenir merchandising revenues and commissions from food and beverage sales were higher in  partially reflecting the negative impact of poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events held at ams  bms and lvms in the overall increase was partially offset by revenues of the jrg driving school which was sold in december  and by the cancellation of tms s nascar sprint cup series qualifying and iroc racing event in the current period as discussed earlier

concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in the company s operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
one nascar sprint cup racing event is scheduled at the newly purchased nhms in the second and third quarters of fiscal  and operating income will likely increase in those quarters and decrease in the first and fourth quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s motorsports business

the purchases can be in the open market or private transactions 
in february  the board of directors increased the authorized total number of shares that can be repurchased under this program from one million to two million shares 
the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
the company repurchased  and  shares of common stock for approximately million in each of and  and could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current authorization as of december  capital expenditures management believes significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   the company had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and for other site improvements at its speedways 
similar to prior years  the company plans to continue expanding concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities  particularly at its newly acquired nhms 
in  lms plans to continue renovating and modernizing certain grandstand seating and expand its hospitality areas  and construct a modern  lighted dragstrip 
the company also plans to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  and reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at its speedways  and may purchase additional land for expansion or development 
projects in  the company completed various construction projects to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and for other site improvements at its speedways

lms significantly expanded its available hospitality areas and other marketing facilities to better attract and entertain fans and corporate clientele 
also  lms started renovating and modernizing certain grandstand seating and further expanding its hospitality areas 
the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in is approximately to million 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under the revolving facility as needed 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at its facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes which  if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company also continually evaluates new opportunities that will add value for its stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon the company s results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility allows annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million  increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on october  to shareholders of record as of october  the annual cash dividend was paid using available cash and cash investments 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  as of december   the company had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of million and contingent guarantee obligations associated with an equity investment that are limited to million  decrease annually and expire through based on specified terms and conditions 
at this time  management believes the fair value of this guarantee is presently insignificant 
as further described in near term operating factors above  the credit facility provides for a separate sub limit for letters of credit of up to million for use in the company s oil and gas activities and other business transactions 
the company presently does not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on its financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
the company continually reviews its accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on its financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
the company s critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements are not repeated in this section 
the company believes the critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  and equity investments in associated entities as of december   the company has net prop speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k erty and equipment of  million  net goodwill and other intangible assets of million  and equity investments in associated entities of million 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company follows sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and expanded testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  the company evaluates long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management believes no impairment exists at december   however  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements oil and gas activities  the company s property and equipment includes capitalized oil and gas exploration and production costs associated with consolidated foreign entities of million as of december  these amounts consist principally of capitalized costs for oil and gas mineral rights  road construction  and exploration and drilling predominately with unproven reserves and  to a lesser extent  proven reserves accounted for under the full cost accounting method 
oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
direct and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and gas properties are capitalized and included in property and equipment as capitalized oil and gas exploration and production costs 
amortization of these costs is determined using the unit of production method based on estimated proven oil and gas reserves 
costs associated with properties under development or unevaluated are initially excluded from full cost amortization bases until determined proven or not  at which time capitalized amounts become subject to the full cost ceiling limitations 
the company performs a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether carrying values of our full cost pools exceed ceiling limitations 
proven or unproven reserves may be less than originally expected or found not cost beneficial to extract 
successful drilling of a well does not ensure ultimate realization of sufficient profits or return on investments because of a variety of factors  including geological  market  geopolitical and other unforeseen factors 
additionally  unsuccessful wells can result in costs with no direct associated revenue streams 
ceiling tests could be found to no longer support some or all of the recorded carrying values due to many reasons  most of which are not under management s control 
while management believes no writedown of capitalized costs was necessary as of december   the carrying value of current and future investments could become impaired from failed ceiling tests  insufficient sustained profitability or operating cash flows resulting from the aforementioned and other factors 
such factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in an impairment charge that has a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to legal actions affecting or involving visheraneft  one of the entities owning certain mineral rights the company purchased 
while management believes the outcome of legal action affecting visheraneft should be resolved in the company s favor  an unfavorable outcome of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on its future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the company has equity investments in associated entities of million 
the company follows the impairment provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock whereby declines in investment value assessed as other than temporary would be recognized as a charge to earnings 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s carrying value for its ma equity investment was significantly reduced as of december  for impairment charges reflected by ma 
as of december   the company believes there were no indications of a decline below ma s carrying value that was other than temporary 
however  ma continues to have a material amount of inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as further described in near term operating factors motorsports authentics joint venture above  future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors 
the company s current and future carrying value of this equity investment could become impaired for changes in profitability  operating cash flows  market and economic conditions  and other factors that could adversely impact recovery 
should future ma inventory or long lived assets become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge  the company would be required to record its share which could have a material adverse impact on speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
also  should the fair value of the company s equity investment in ma decline below its carrying value  and such decline was other than temporary  the company would be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to fair value  which could have a material adverse impact on its future financial condition or results of operations 
there are various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment that are further described in item a risk factors above 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the company has net property and equipment of  million and net amortizable intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company has nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because the company has a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on its financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
as further described above in near term operating factors oil and gas activities and risk factors our oil and gas business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of its other operations  oil and gas transactions may involve risks and other factors with respect to the realization of receivables and inventories that are different from its motorsports operations 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net current and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million and million  after reduction for current and noncurrent deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million and million are provided against current and noncurrent deferred tax assets  respectively 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements and below  the speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k change was due primarily to reflecting a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets  associated with equity investee losses of motorsports authentics because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not 
the company s effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense

the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
the company accrues a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
management believes amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position or results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against the company  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and the company s future financial condition or results of operations
