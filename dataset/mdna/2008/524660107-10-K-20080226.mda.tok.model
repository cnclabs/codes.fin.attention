overview of our four segments in continuing operations residential furnishings segment logo our residential furnishings segment began with an patent of the steel coil bedspring 
today  we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
our wide range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs 
long production runs  internal production of key raw materials  and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than our customers can produce the same parts for their own use 
in addition to cost savings  sourcing components from leggett allows our customers to focus on designing  merchandising and marketing their products 
products products manufactured or distributed by our residential furnishings groups include bedding group innersprings sets of steel coils  bound together  that form the core of a mattress wire forms for mattress foundations adjustable electric beds home furniture consumer products group steel mechanisms and hardware enabling furniture to recline  tilt  swivel  rock and elevate for reclining chairs and sleeper sofas springs and seat suspensions for chairs  sofas and loveseats steel tubular seat frames bed frames  ornamental beds  comforters  decorative pillows and other top of bed accessories

table of contents customers customers of the commercial fixturing components segment include retail chains and specialty shops brand name marketers and distributors of consumer products office  institutional and commercial furniture manufacturers industrial materials segment logo the high quality of the industrial materials segment s products and service  together with low cost  have made us north america s leading supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing 
our wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately  tons  nearly all of which is used by our own wire mills 
we have six wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by leggett s other domestic businesses 
our tubing group operates two major plants that also supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing 
in addition to supporting our internal requirements  the industrial materials segment supplies many external customers with wire and tubing products 
products products manufactured or distributed by our industrial materials groups include wire group steel rod drawn wire fabricated wire products  such as wire ties to bale cotton  shaped wire for automotive and medical supply applications  tying heads  boxed wire  and parts for automatic baling equipment  coated wire products  including dishwasher racks  and wire retail fixtures and point of purchase displays 
tubing group welded steel tubing fabricated tube components customers leggett uses about half of our wire output and about one quarter of our welded steel tubing output to manufacture our own products 
for example  we use our wire and steel tubing to make bedding and furniture components motion furniture mechanisms commercial fixtures  point of purchase displays and shelving automotive seat components and frames 
table of contents the industrial materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers  including bedding and furniture makers automotive seating manufacturers lawn and garden equipment manufacturers mechanical spring makers waste recyclers  waste removal businesses and cotton balers medical supply businesses specialized products segment logo our specialized products segment designs  produces and sells components primarily for automotive seating  specialized machinery and equipment  and service van interiors

table of contents acquisitions and divestitures historically  our typical acquisition targets have been small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either within our existing product lines or one step away from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses 
as part of the strategic plan  we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed 
all acquisitions must create value by enhancing tsr  they must have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets 
acquisitions we acquired businesses during with annualized sales of approximately million broken down by segment as follows commercial fixturing components million industrial materials million specialized products million in commercial fixturing components we added one business located in china which produces office furniture components 
we also added one business to the industrial materials segment  which produces coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers 
finally  in the specialized products segment  we added a business which is a designer and assembler of docking stations that secure computer and other electronic equipment inside vehicles 
acquisitions we acquired businesses in with annualized sales of about million 
all of the transactions occurred in the residential furnishings segment 
these acquisitions broadened our geographic presence and product offering in geo components  expanded our carpet underlay business  and added to our international spring operations 
acquisitions in  we acquired businesses with annualized sales in continuing operations of approximately million million in residential furnishings and million in specialized products 
these businesses primarily expanded our presence in the conversion and distribution of geo components  broadened our offerings for carpet underlay  and added to our business that manufactures and installs products for commercial vehicles 
for further information about acquisitions  see note g on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
divestitures for a description of our planned divestitures associated with the strategic plan  see the strategic plan in this item business on page in the first quarter of  we divested our prime foam products business unit  which primarily produced commodity foam used for cushioning by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers 
we retained our operations that manufacture carpet underlay 
this sale marked the largest divestiture in our history  generating a pre tax gain of approximately million 
for the full years and  the prime foam products business unit contributed  respectively  million and million of sales 
our former prime foam products business unit is classified as a discontinued operation 
for further information about divestitures and discontinued operations  see note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents foreign operations the percentages of our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown in the table below 
year percent our international continuing operations  measured by trade sales  are principally located in canada  europe  mexico and china 
we have production facilities in china 
the products we make in these countries associated with continuing operations primarily consist of canada innersprings for mattresses fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries shelving and point of purchase displays for retailers chair frames and bases  table bases and office chair controls lumbar supports for automotive seats wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles europe innersprings for mattresses structural fabric for industrial and residential uses wire and wire products lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components design and distribution of point of purchase displays for retailers mexico innersprings and fabricated wire for the bedding industry structural fabric for industrial and residential uses retail shelving and point of purchase displays automotive control cable systems china innersprings for mattresses recliner mechanisms and bases for upholstered furniture formed wire for upholstered furniture retail store fixtures and gondola shelving office furniture components  including chair bases and casters stamped seat frames and formed metal products for automotive seating cables and small electric motors used in lumbar systems for automotive seating machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing 
also  in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we have located facilities nearby to supply them efficiently 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country 
these risks include nationalization of private enterprises 
table of contents political instability in certain countries foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation these and other foreign related risks could result in cost increases  reduced profits  the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business 
geographic areas of operation we have manufacturing  warehousing and distribution facilities in countries around the world 
below is a list of countries where we have facilities associated with continuing operations segment north america europe south america asia pacific africa residential furnishings canada mexico united states croatia denmark france spain united kingdom brazil australia china south africa commercial fixturing components canada mexico united states italy united kingdom china industrial materials mexico united states china specialized products canada mexico united states austria belgium croatia germany hungary italy spain switzerland united kingdom china india south korea for further information concerning our long lived assets and sales outside the united states  refer to note o on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales by product line the following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales from continuing operations by product line for the last three years product line bedding components home furniture consumer products fabric  foam fiber fixtures displays office furniture components wire wire products steel tubing automotive products commercial vehicle products specialized machinery 
table of contents distribution of products in each of our segments  we sell and distribute our products primarily through the company s sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials the products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials 
among the most important are various types of steel  including scrap  rod  wire  coil  sheet and angle iron foam scrap woven and non woven fabrics leggett supplies its own raw materials for many of the products we make 
for example  we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire  which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas displays  shelving and racks for retailers automotive seating components we currently supply roughly two thirds of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our us requirements for steel wire 
we also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers 
we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials used by the company 
however  we have experienced volatility in raw material prices in the last three years  most notably in the following areas steel early in the cost of steel scrap increased  leading to higher rod costs 
we have implemented price increases to pass through some of these costs 
in late  once again we began seeing higher steel costs which are continuing into early since early december  market prices have increased to depending upon the type of steel 
foam scrap the cost of foam scrap increased significantly throughout with the overall cost doubling from the prices at the end of foam scrap costs declined in these decreases have led to lower selling prices in carpet underlay  and a sales decline versus in our carpet underlay business unit 
the future pricing of raw materials is uncertain 
the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs  should they occur  could influence our earnings 
higher raw material costs have led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost components  causing us to shift production accordingly 
this has primarily impacted profit margins in our residential furnishings segment 
we are responding by developing new innersprings designed to enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
customers we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
in  no customer accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues from continuing operations 
our top customers accounted for approximately of these consolidated revenues 

table of contents some of our segments have customers whose purchases exceeded of the segment s sales from continuing operations in commercial fixturing components has one customer accounting for approximately and specialized products has one customer accounting for approximately 
the loss of these customers may have a material adverse effect upon the relevant segment 
patents and trademarks leggett holds approximately  patents and has about in process for its various product lines associated with continuing operations 
seventy five issued patents and around pending patents are associated with discontinued operations 
we have registered almost trademarks  with more than in process associated with continuing operations 
we have approximately registered trademarks and almost pending trademarks associated with discontinued operations 
no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our continuing operations 
most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
some of our most significant trademarks include semi flex and semi fold boxspring components and foundations mira coil  verticoil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings lifestyles  s cape and adjustables by leggett platt adjustable electric beds wall hugger recliner chair mechanisms super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag wire forms used in seating tack jump and pattern link quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lator automotive seating products spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing machines abc america s body co  quietflex and masterack equipment and accessories for vans and trucks research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we estimate the cost of research and development associated with continuing operations was approximately to million in each of the last three years 
employees as of december   the company had approximately  employees associated with its continuing operations  of which  were engaged in production 
of the  approximately  are international employees 
labor unions represent roughly  of our employees associated with continuing operations 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 
table of contents the table below shows the approximate number of employees associated with continuing operations by segment 
segment employees residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products unallocated total employees associated with discontinued operations at december  the company had approximately  employees associated with its discontinued operations  of which  employees are in the aluminum products segment   employees are in the residential furnishings segment  employees are in the commercial fixturing components segment  and employees are in the specialized products segment 
for more information on our discontinued operations  see note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we tend to attract and retain customers through product quality  innovation  competitive pricing and customer service  while many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america  in terms of revenue  of the following components for residential furniture and bedding retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays components for office furniture drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems carpet underlay adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe our operations should be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
accordingly  at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
we have experienced increased price competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices and developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
we believe asian manufacturers currently benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as steel and chemicals 
foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
we believe innersprings are being imported into the us at low prices that violate our trade laws  and also are frequently imported under improper tariff classifications  thus avoiding duties 
in late  we filed an anti dumping petition with the us government on behalf of the innerspring industry to attempt to remedy this situation 

table of contents seasonality as a diversified manufacturer  we do not experience significant seasonality  although our quarter to quarter sales have generally varied in proportion to the total year by roughly 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
our four segments associated with continuing operations tend to experience seasonality as follows residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during those periods 
commercial fixturing components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
industrial materials minimal variation in sales throughout the year 
specialized products relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships 
working capital items for information regarding working capital items  see the discussion of cash from operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  on page environmental regulation the company s operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment 
we have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and a commitment to protect the natural and workplace environments 
while we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies  management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition or results of operations

item a 
risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking and other statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 
our strategic plan may not produce the benefits expected 
in november  the company adopted the strategic plan 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement the strategic plan on terms and conditions that are favorable to us 
the timing of the implementation may be longer than expected 
we may not be able to complete the planned divestitures on terms 
table of contents favorable to us 
we may also experience a negative impact from our employees  customers and vendors 
as such  the strategic plan may not produce the benefits expected by the company 
these setbacks could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow from operations and the value of our common stock 
costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we often attempt to implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
we encounter greater difficulty in implementing these price increases in businesses where we have a smaller market share and in products that are of a commodity nature 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
steel is our most significant raw material 
in late  we began seeing higher steel costs which are continuing into early the global steel and scrap markets are very cyclical in nature  and can result in large swings in margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by the cost of other raw materials 
in  the cost of foam scrap increased steadily with the overall cost doubling from the prices at the end of in  the cost of foam scrap decreased significantly 
since our carpet underlay selling prices are tied to the cost of foam scrap  this cost decrease has impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  our reported amount of carpet underlay sales 
higher raw material costs led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this has primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that may affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore drive demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
significant changes in these economic factors may negatively impact the demand for our products and our results of operations 
asian competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished product from asia 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed 

table of contents if our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe that our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
at december   we operated facilities in china 
if demand in china and other foreign countries increases at a more rapid rate than we are able to establish operations  our market share and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
also  we have experienced increased price competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
if this price competition continues we could lose further market share and our earnings could continue to be negatively impacted 
we may not be able to improve operating results in the store fixtures business unit 
the store fixtures business unit in our commercial fixturing components segment has been placed in the fix category as a result of our strategic plan and given a month deadline by which to improve performance 
factors within the company s control could contribute to increased margins and earnings improvements in this unit 
these factors include  but are not limited to addressing performance issues at underperforming facilities  and purchasing  pricing and continuous improvement initiatives 
we have initiated restructuring in the store fixtures business unit which includes the elimination of approximately million of the unit s least profitable revenue 
however  through this restructuring activity we may not achieve the margin and earnings improvements that we anticipate 
the store fixtures business unit is part of the fixture display group  which incurred goodwill impairment charges of million for the year ended december our long lived assets are subject to potential impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets not held for sale represented approximately billion  or of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment  sundry assets and non current assets held for sale totaled approximately  million  or approximately of total assets 
goodwill is assessed for impairment annually  and as triggering events may occur 
other long lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted interim impairment testing as a result of the changes announced with the strategic plan and determined that some long lived assets were impaired 
for the year ended december   we incurred goodwill impairment of million  and long lived asset impairment of million 
if our business units do not perform as expected we may be required to recognize additional  material reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of long lived assets 
also  as of december  the company had million of net assets classified as held for sale  of which million represented assets not associated with the strategic plan 
if the proceeds generated from these divestitures do not recover their carrying value  the company will be required to recognize losses on the sale of these assets to the extent of the shortfall 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales from continuing operations was generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
we cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
highlights we changed strategic course in during the year we completed an extensive strategic review of our business portfolio 
we realigned our goals to focus on improving total shareholder return 
we adopted role based portfolio management with different roles for each business unit based upon competitive advantages  strategic position  and financial health and implemented a much more rigorous strategic planning process 
we also began eliminating or rapidly improving the parts of our business that have been weighing us down 
many of the planned divestitures and necessary operating improvements should occur during as a result of these changes  we expect to generate significant amounts of cash  spend less cash than in recent years  and return more cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in support of this objective  the board of directors authorized a increase to the annual dividend  beginning in january the board also approved  in february  the repurchase of up to million shares during at management s discretion  limited to the amount of divestiture proceeds 
this authorization is in addition to a standing approval to repurchase million shares each year 
sales and earnings of our ongoing businesses declined in as demand in many us markets softened 
international markets were generally stronger  and growth in our international businesses offset some of the domestic weakness 
in addition  we recognized significant  non cash goodwill and asset impairment charges in late following the implementation of the strategic plan 
these charges represent virtually all of the costs we anticipate for the strategic plan 
cash from operations increased significantly in despite generally weak market conditions 
this strong cash from operations coupled with the proceeds from the divestiture of our prime foam business early in the year resulted in significant available funds 
a portion of these funds was used for capital expenditures and acquisitions  and much of the remainder was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
the balance sheet remains very strong  we ended the year with net debt as a percentage of net capital slightly below our long term  targeted range 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 
introduction what we do leggett platt is a fortune diversified manufacturer that conceives  designs  and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes  retail stores  offices  and automobiles 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  adjustable beds  carpet underlay  retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays  components for office furniture  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and machinery used by the bedding industry for wire forming  sewing  and quilting 
our segments our continuing operations are composed of business units  with approximately  employee partners  and more than facilities located in countries around the world 
our segments are residential furnishings  commercial fixturing components  industrial materials  and specialized products 

table of contents logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  carpet cushion  geo components  and other finished products 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point of purchase displays used by retailers 
we also produce chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers 
industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  retail store fixtures and displays  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we manufacture and install the racks  shelving  and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans 
we also produce machinery  both for ourselves and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
discontinued operations and other divestitures we divested our prime foam operations in early and expect to divest seven additional businesses during as a result of these activities  several businesses are disclosed in our year end financial statements as discontinued operations 
those businesses  listed according to the segment in which they previously resided  include aluminum products entire segment residential furnishings prime foam sold in march  fibers  and wood products commercial fixturing components storage products and plastics specialized products commercial vehicle products dealer unit we also plan to divest our coated fabrics business which is a part of residential furnishings in  but that divestiture is in an early stage and does not yet qualify the business as a discontinued operation 

table of contents customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with no single one representing even of our sales from continuing operations 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
we primarily sell our products through our own sales employees  although we also use independent sales representatives and distributors in some of our businesses 
strategic changes during  we completed an extensive review of our business portfolio  triggered in part by our underperformance versus stated growth and operating targets 
for each business unit  we considered factors such as competitive advantages  market position  financial performance  and potential growth opportunities 
we are making significant changes to our financial targets  portfolio mix  and planning processes as a result of the review 
total shareholder return tsr is now the key success measure that we will monitor 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends received beginning stock price 
historically  our primary objective was profitable growth 
going forward  we intend to generate higher tsr through a greater emphasis on improving returns and maximizing cash flow  with growth representing just one of several means to achieve that result 
we are modifying our incentive plans to emphasize the importance of  and reward  tsr 
beginning in  we introduced tsr based incentives for senior executives and modified business unit bonuses to include a link to return on assets 
we are adopting role based portfolio management and plan to tilt our investments toward businesses with competitive advantages and financial health 
certain of our businesses growth businesses are positioned to generate value through further growth  while others core businesses are positioned to drive value by improving returns and maximizing cash flow 
both are critical drivers of tsr 
we will allocate capital to each business unit bu based upon its role in the portfolio 
we plan to invest aggressively in growth businesses that hold strong competitive positions and consistently achieve compelling returns on those investments 
we plan to maintain or improve our competitive position in core businesses that typically hold stable positions in solid markets where returns are somewhat lower and focus on improving returns  but limit further investment in these operations 
in total  we anticipate lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisitions in the near term 
in addition  we are implementing a more rigorous strategic planning process to continually assess our business units and help guide future decisions regarding the role of each bu  capital allocation priorities  and new areas in which to grow 
after significant study  we are narrowing our focus and eliminating over of the portfolio based upon each bu s strategic value and financial returns 
most of this activity is expected to occur in the largest portion of the revenue reduction  approximately million  will come from the divestiture of the aluminum products segment and six additional business units 
additionally  the store fixtures business unit was given a month deadline by which to significantly improve performance  we expect to prune about million of the unit s least profitable revenue 
finally  several business units  though otherwise healthy  contain individual plants that are operating at unacceptable profit levels 
we expect to close or divest a number of these unprofitable facilities  resulting in a revenue reduction of approximately million 
we believe these changes will increase available cash  and we intend to return more of this cash to shareholders 
in support of this objective  the board of directors authorized a dividend increase  moving the annual rate to per share from the previous 
this increase was effective with the quarterly dividend paid in january we also expect to continue repurchasing our shares  and have a standing million share annual authorization from the board 
in addition to the standing authorization  the board has approved the repurchase of up to an additional million shares during at management s discretion  limited to the amount of divestiture proceeds 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand for our products  raw material cost trends  and competition 

table of contents market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
throughout  demand weakness in the us home related and retail markets led to lower volume in certain of our businesses 
in contrast  we saw strength in most international markets  including bedding  furniture  and automotive  as well as the non dealer portion of our domestic commercial vehicle products business 
several factors  including higher energy costs  have reduced disposable income  leading to more conservative spending by us consumers on major discretionary purchases 
in addition  a slump in the housing market and increased competition from other types of consumer goods such as electronics have led to lower demand for our products 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can change significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
purchasing arrangements vary across the company 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly our raw material costs generally move with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term purchase contracts with pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors do not always honor those contracts 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
we have few long term  fixed pricing contracts with customers 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
although we are generally able to pass through most cost increases  we encounter greater difficulty i in businesses where we have a smaller market share  and ii in products that are of a commodity nature 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time negatively impacts our earnings 
steel is our principal raw material and at various times during the past three years we have experienced cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers via selling price adjustments 
in late  once again we began seeing higher steel costs which are continuing into early since early december  market prices have increased from to  depending on the type of steel 
we have announced price increases to recover some of these higher costs 
we also experienced significant inflation in foam scrap  chemicals  fibers  and resins during the past three years  but recovered most of the higher costs through selling price increases 
during the cost of foam scrap declined from peak levels  resulting in lower selling prices in our carpet underlay business 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments in recent years  as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation 
our profit margins were negatively impacted as a result of this de contenting 
we are responding by developing new products including new types of innersprings that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
some of these new products were introduced during 
table of contents competition many of our markets are highly competitive  with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  superior manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  and greater financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
in recent years  we experienced increased price competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components is partially due to lower wire costs in china 
asian manufacturers currently benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as steel and chemicals 
foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
we believe innersprings are being imported into the us at low prices that violate our trade laws  and also are frequently imported under improper tariff classifications  thus avoiding duties 
in late we filed an anti dumping petition with the us government on behalf of the innerspring industry to attempt to remedy this situation 
divestiture in march  we completed the divestiture of our prime foam operations  which primarily produced commodity foam used for cushioning by upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturers 
we retained our foam operations that produce carpet underlay 
with revenue of approximately million  this divestiture is the largest in leggett s history 
asset impairments and restructuring during  we recognized million of net impairment and restructuring related charges  the vast majority of which were non cash items incurred following the implementation of the strategic plan announced in november and discussed earlier in this md a 
of these charges  approximately million were associated with the planned divestitures included in discontinued operations 
the remaining million relates to continuing operations and includes million of goodwill impairment in the fixture display business 
the table below provides more detail regarding the net charges 
in  we expect an additional to million of costs associated with the strategic plan 
millions of dollars amount cash non cash restructuring charges goodwill impairment charges other asset impairment charges inventory obsolescence and other costs costs related to the strategic plan other restructuring related costs in gains from sales of assets in net costs 
table of contents in the third quarter of  we launched a significant broad based restructuring project to reduce excess capacity and improve performance in a number of our businesses 
that restructuring was essentially completed in as part of the restructuring plan  we identified underutilized or underperforming facilities that were subsequently closed  consolidated  or sold 
we also took a more critical look at other underperforming operations  as a result  we modified or accelerated restructuring activities that were previously underway  and identified other operations with impaired assets 
net costs recognized in and for all restructuring related activities were million and million  respectively 
we provide additional details about asset impairment and restructuring in notes c and d on pages and  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations vs

we experienced soft demand throughout in the us home related and retail markets that we serve  but these declines were partially offset by strength in most of our international markets and the non dealer portion of the domestic commercial vehicle products business 
these trends are discussed in the segment results below 
full year earnings from continuing operations of 
per share were significantly lower than the prior year  primarily due to the non cash charges and tax items  but also from weak demand in many of our domestic markets 
the tax items include  in  adjustments to valuation allowances related to potential foreign tax benefits  and in  a benefit from the write off of an acquired company s stock

acquisitions net of two small divestitures partially offset the decline 
the sales decrease is primarily due to soft demand in the us residential markets during and very strong sales in our carpet underlay business during international demand for both bedding and upholstered furniture components was considerably stronger  and partially offset the domestic sales declines

ebit and ebit margins improved significantly  reflecting higher sales in the segment and earnings from a company acquired early in these gains were partially offset as the strength of the canadian dollar negatively impacted our automotive business we incur costs in canadian dollars and sell in us dollars

the restructuring related sales decrease occurred as we chose to walk away from business that was marginally profitable  or in some instances  unprofitable 
internal sales declines reflect lower volume in certain businesses partially offset by inflation related sales growth from price increases we implemented to recover higher raw material costs 
in the north american bedding market  volume was weak for most of the year and softened further beginning in september 
automotive demand  and to a lesser extent  custom store fixture demand was also soft for most of the year 
in contrast  our residential furniture components  office furniture components  machinery  and carpet underlay businesses performed very well 
these trends are discussed in the segment results below 
net earnings and earnings per share increased versus primarily due to lower restructuring related charges and lower workers compensation expense 
in  we significantly increased our reserves for workers compensation to reflect higher costs of medical care and longer durations of claims 
workers compensation costs returned to normal levels in earnings also benefited in from restructuring related operating improvements and acquisitions 
a lower share count drove a portion of the increase in earnings per share 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by product mix higher raw material costs in recent years have led some customers to modify their product design and replace higher cost components with lower cost and lower margin components

over the prior three year period  we also increased net debt to fund a portion of our requirements 
in keeping with our stated financial goals  net debt to net capital has increased from at the beginning of to at the end of our long term target is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the range  while maintaining our longstanding single a debt rating 
the table on page shows the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital for the past two years 

table of contents uses of cash finance capital requirements we use cash to fund internal growth through capital expenditures and external growth through acquisitions 
for the next two years  we plan to focus primarily on improving returns of the existing asset base 
that pursuit will require much of senior management s time and attention  and revenue growth during this period is expected to be minimal 
logo capital expenditures are investments we make to modernize  maintain  and expand manufacturing capacity 
with our move to role based portfolio management  we expect to be more restrictive in funding capital projects 
accordingly  we expect future capital spending to be less than in recent years 
capital spending in is expected to be about million 
growth capital  which has historically been available to all our businesses  will now be predominantly earmarked for our growth business units 
operations that are a part of our core business units will receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements  but expansion capital will be limited 
logo 
table of contents we have also set a higher bar for acquisitions  and do not anticipate many coming to fruition over the next one to two years 
longer term  we plan to pursue disciplined growth through fewer  but more strategic  opportunities 
we will seek acquisitions within our growth businesses  and will also look for longer term opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets that meet strict criteria 
in  we acquired three businesses that should add about million to annual revenue million in commercial fixturing components  million in industrial materials  and million in specialized products 
these businesses establish a foothold in asian production of office chair controls manufacture coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers  and present leggett with expanded technologies and cross segment selling opportunities broaden our suite of products for commercial vehicle interiors we acquired five businesses in with annualized sales of about million 
all these transactions occurred in the residential furnishings segment 
these acquisitions broadened our geographic presence and product offerings in geo components expanded our rubber carpet underlay business added to our international spring operations in  we acquired companies with annualized sales in continuing operations of approximately million million in residential furnishings and million in specialized products 
these businesses primarily expanded our presence in the conversion and distribution of geo components broadened our offerings for carpet underlay added to our business that manufactures and installs products for commercial vehicles in addition to the initial cash outlays for acquisitions shown in the accompanying chart  we also assumed debt of million  million  and million  respectively in the   and transactions 
we provide additional details about acquisitions in note g to the financial statements on page pay dividends logo with improvement in returns  the expected decrease in capital spending and acquisitions  and the planned divestitures  we should have more available cash to return to shareholders 
higher annual dividends are one means by which that will occur 
with the january 
dividend payment  we have now raised annual dividends for consecutive years at a compound annual rate of over 
we expect to spend approximately million on dividends in long term  our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings  but will likely be higher for the next two years 

table of contents repurchase stock logo share repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during the past three years  we purchased a total of million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by about 
the cash available to repurchase shares will fluctuate each year  primarily from changes in earnings  timing of divestitures  and the pace of spending on acquisitions 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have a standing authorization from the board of directors to repurchase up to million shares annually 
in addition to the standing authorization  the board has approved the repurchase of up to an additional million shares in at management s discretion  limited to the amount of divestiture proceeds 
cash from operations logo cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
changes in earnings and working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
in  cash from operations increased from  as significant working capital improvements offset lower earnings 
the working capital improvements resulted primarily from better accounts receivable collections and ongoing efforts to manage inventories 

table of contents in  cash from operations increased over earnings grew in  but were partially offset by increased working capital due to higher inventories 
this inventory increase resulted primarily from softening demand in certain markets and opportunistic pre buys of raw materials 
working capital levels vary by segment  with the requirements of commercial fixturing components generally higher than overall company averages 
accounts receivable balances in this segment are typically higher due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the fixture display business 
this business also requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 
in the december  balance sheet  we have classified certain assets and liabilities of the planned divestitures as amounts held for sale 
depreciation and amortization are no longer recognized on these assets  accordingly  we anticipate that the depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately million lower than capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities shareholders equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these calculations include current maturities but exclude commercial paper 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  and implied interest included in operating leases 

table of contents the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and we show this calculation in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization  each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 
we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows more meaningful comparison to recent periods during which cash fluctuated significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities decreased million in during the year  we added million of debt  including million of commercial paper borrowings  and repaid million of debt that came due 
since  we ve issued million of fixed rate debt with an average remaining life at the end of of years  and a weighted average interest rate of 
to further facilitate the issuance of debt and other securities  million remains available under a shelf registration 
in addition to issuing long term notes  we can also raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit commitment that terminates in we expect any commercial paper issued under this agreement to be classified as long term debt since we intend to maintain or increase the balance until it is replaced with long term notes 
at the end of  million in commercial paper was outstanding under this program 
with both the shelf registration and the commercial paper program in place  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations  return cash to shareholders  and fund planned growth 
most of our debt has fixed repayment dates 
at the end of  this debt consisted primarily of term notes 
we have maintained a single a rating from both moody s and standard poor s on our term notes and public debt for over a decade 
our commercial paper program carries a moody s rating of p and a standard poor s rating of a this discussion is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold the company s public debt 
furthermore  these ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time  and each should be evaluated separately 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including pensions and reserves for tax contingencies total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
long term debt includes million of outstanding commercial paper  which is generally due overnight 
we have classified commercial paper as long term debt due in years since the commercial paper program is supported by a million revolving credit agreement which terminates in purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 
these totals include interest on the million of outstanding commercial paper discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed here are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements asset and goodwill impairment inventory workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs credit losses pension accounting income taxes contingencies we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the financial statements on page 
table of contents asset and goodwill impairment goodwill is assessed for impairment annually  and as triggering events occur 
other long lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the assessments are performed to ensure that future cash flows from use of the assets exceed the assets book value 
in doing so  we make judgments and estimates about a the future cash flows expected from use and eventual disposition of the assets  and b the assets fair market values 
if actual future cash flows are lower than our estimates  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
our ten reporting units for goodwill purposes related to continuing operations are one level below our operating segments  and are the same as the business groups disclosed in item business 
we assess our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment on an annual basis and whenever events warrant 
in doing so  we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price to earnings ratios 
key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate  internal sales growth  margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor  but not the only factor  in our assessment 
in june  we performed the annual goodwill impairment review and determined that no impairments were indicated for any reporting units 
in the fourth quarter  we performed an interim goodwill impairment review as a result of the november strategic plan which was considered a triggering event as defined in fas the fair value of each reporting unit was adjusted to reflect the significant decrease in the company s overall market value since june 
in addition  individual reporting units impacted by the november strategic plan were revised to reflect updated margin and growth assumptions 
as a result of this interim review  we determined that impairments were indicated for the aluminum and fixtures display reporting units  resulting in goodwill impairments of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded goodwill and asset impairments of million in the fourth quarter relating to other held for sale locations 
inventory in determining the value of inventories  we make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
at december   we had reduced inventory values by million approximately of total inventory not held for sale valued on a fifo basis to account for obsolete and slow moving items 
workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs we are substantially self insured for certain costs related to workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance 
when estimating the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured  we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
in  we significantly increased our reserve for workers compensation to reflect higher costs of medical care and longer durations of claims as more treatment options are available and can continue over longer periods of time 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with these insurance programs 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 

table of contents credit losses our customers are diverse 
many are small to medium sized companies  and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
we regularly evaluate the ability of our customers to pay what they owe us 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
we consider factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical experience 
the total amount of credit losses over the last three years is million 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts not held for sale totaled million about of our accounts and notes receivable of million 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the two most critical assumptions affecting these estimates are the discount rate and the expected return on assets 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
we have recognized the impact of individual plans funded amounts on the balance sheet  and continue to use a september measurement date for our most significant plans 
to reflect market interest rates  in we increased the discount rate for our major pension plans from to 
this follows an increase in from to 
we continued to assume long term returns of on the assets of these plans  which was identical to our and assumptions 
sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for our major plans is as follows discount rate a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 
million and decrease the plans funded status by approximately million 
expected return on assets a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
we expect that the combined contribution in to our defined benefit plans will total approximately million 
on december   our defined benefit retirement plan covering non union employees was frozen  thereby eliminating the future accrual of benefits to participants and closing the plan to future enrollment 
this plan change reduced the projected benefit obligation by million  and reduced pension expense by million 
participants were moved to a defined contribution plan with a company contribution based upon the age of the participant 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
at december   five open years were undergoing or subject to audit by the united states internal revenue service irs and canada revenue agency 
in  audits in both countries for the years and 
table of contents were settled in all material respects with no significant adjustments 
in  the irs examination for the years and was concluded 
a final report was issued  and the net refund of approximately million  plus interest  under review by the joint committee on taxation as of december   was received in the largest issue pertained to a refund claim we made for a worthless stock deduction 
the resolution of this item was reflected in as a reduction in the company s overall tax rate 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
valuation reserves are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts that we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of such earnings 
contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
the company has been named as one of numerous defendants in several cases consolidated as gray v 
derderian  case no 
cv l  usdc usdc this litigation resulted from a nightclub fire in west warwick  rhode island involving multiple deaths and injuries 
along with other foam manufacturing defendants  the company is alleged to have manufactured and sold bulk polyurethane foam to a foam fabricator in rhode island  who in turn  is alleged to have fabricated and sold foam sheets to the nightclub 
the foam was among other materials alleged to have caught fire when pyrotechnics were ignited inside the nightclub 
the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages in an unspecified amount 
the litigation is in its early stages 
we believe the company has raised valid defenses to the claims 
we intend to continue vigorously defending these claims 
the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from this litigation 
however  the company s insurance coverages including a million self retention amount are sufficient to satisfy the latest settlement demand 
management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
in  we recorded a receivable of million related to an ongoing international dispute over duties imposed by the united states on softwood lumber imported from canada 
in the us and canada finalized an agreement to settle this dispute and as a result  we were refunded million in duties and interest for our claim 
the refund was recorded as income million in and million in and is reflected in earnings from discontinued operations 
since this claim is now settled  we do not anticipate any further payments 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas requires the company to recognize the funded status of each of its defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
this requirement was effective as of december   and is reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
sfas will also require the company to measure the funded status of its plans as of year end beginning with the december  balance sheet 
the company currently uses september as the measurement date for its most significant plans 
the company has chosen to perform a measurement that covers the month period of october  through december  a proportionate allocation is made to cover the net benefit expense or income for the transition period and that amount will be recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings on january  
table of contents the company has evaluated the effect of this standard and determined that it will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect fair value measurements have on earnings 
the primary areas in which the company utilizes fair value measures are valuing pension plan assets and liabilities  valuing hedge related derivative financial instruments  allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  and evaluating long term assets for potential impairment 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial assets and liabilities of the company beginning january  sfas is effective beginning january  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the company has evaluated the effect of this standard and does not believe that it will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other instruments at fair value  with the objective of improving financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for the company beginning january  the company has evaluated the effect of this standard and determined that it will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes  and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas r amends sfas such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r would also apply the provisions of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which seeks to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in their consolidated financial statements 
sfas is also effective for the company beginning january   and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements
