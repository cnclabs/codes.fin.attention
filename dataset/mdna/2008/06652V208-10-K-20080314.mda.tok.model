banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
our primary business is that of traditional financial institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding our offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
lending activities include commercial business and commercial real estate loans  agriculture business loans  construction and land development loans  one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
a portion of banner bank s construction and mortgage lending activities are conducted through its subsidiary  community financial corporation cfc  which is located in the lake oswego area of portland  oregon 
over the past several years  we have invested significantly in expanding our branch and distributions systems with a primary emphasis on expanding our presence in the four largest areas of commerce in the northwest the puget sound region of washington and the greater boise  idaho  portland  oregon  and spokane  washington markets 
as a result of our aggressive franchise expansion  we have added new branches through acquisition  opened new branches and relocated eight others in the last three years 
in  we completed the acquisitions of three smaller commercial banks in the state of washington 
these acquisitions increased our presence within desirable marketplaces and allow us to better serve existing and future customers 
our branch expansion has been a significant element in our strategy to grow loans  deposits and customer relationships 
this emphasis on growth has resulted in an elevated level of operating expenses  however  we believe that over time these new branches should help improve profitability by providing lower cost core deposits which will allow us to proportionately reduce higher cost borrowings as a source of funds 
we now have reached our goal in terms of the number of branches required to generate deposit growth sufficient to fund our expected loan growth and produce significant fee generating opportunities 
as a result  we plan to open only three additional branches in  a normal level of growth for a bank of our size 
recent developments on may   we completed the acquisition of f m bank f m spokane  washington  in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million  with million of cash and  shares of banner corporation common stock  for of the outstanding common shares of f m 
f m was merged into banner bank and the results of its operations are included in those of banner bank starting in the quarter ended june  the purchase of f m allowed us to immediately expand banner bank s franchise in the spokane  washington area  the fourth largest metropolitan market in the pacific northwest  by the addition of branches and one loan office 
on may   we also completed the acquisition of san juan financial holding company sjfhc  the parent company of islanders bank  friday harbor  washington  in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million  with million of cash and  shares of banner corporation common stock  for of the outstanding common shares of sjfhc 
sjfhc was merged into banner corporation and islanders bank has continued to operate as a separate subsidiary of banner corporation 
the results of its operations are included in banner s consolidated operations beginning in the quarter ended june  the acquisition of islanders bank  with its three branches located in the san juan islands  added to our presence in the north puget sound region 
on october   we completed the acquisition of ncw community bank ncw  wenatchee  washington  in a transaction valued at approximately million  with million of cash and  shares of banner corporation common stock being exchanged for all of the outstanding common shares and stock options of ncw 
ncw operated one branch in wenatchee  washington and had another branch under construction in east wenatchee 
ncw merged into banner bank in connection with this transaction during the fourth quarter of the merger added to banner s customer base and market share in the north central washington area and allowed for the consolidation of the two banks branch locations and staffs 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for more detailed information with respect to our acquisitions 
lending activities general all of our lending activities are conducted through banner bank  its subsidiary  community financial corporation  and islanders bank 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers 
we originate loans for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
management s strategy has been to maintain a significant percentage of assets in the loan portfolio with more frequent interest rate repricing terms or shorter maturities than traditional long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
as part of this effort  we have developed a variety of floating or adjustable interest rate products that correlate more closely with our cost of funds 
however  in response to customer demand  we continue to originate fixed rate loans  including fixed interest rate mortgage loans with terms of up to years 
the relative amount of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment 
while we offer a wide range of loan products  we do not now and have not previously engaged in any sub prime lending 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties 
in response to strong housing markets  construction and land loan growth has been particularly significant over the past three years  although our origination of new construction and land loans did slow appreciably during the second half of as market conditions became much less favorable 
at december   construction and land loans represent nearly one third of our loan portfolio 
our lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
commercial lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
we have also recently increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans is still relatively small 
while continuing our commitment to construction and residential lending  we expect commercial lending including commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural lending and consumer lending to become increasingly important activities for us 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion 
for additional information concerning our loan portfolio  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and loans lending 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio  and tables and a  which contain information regarding the loans maturing in our portfolio 
one to four family residential real estate lending at both banner bank and islanders bank  we originate loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences in the northwest communities where we have offices 
banner bank s mortgage lending subsidiary  cfc  provides residential lending primarily in the greater portland and pasco tri cities  washington market areas 
as noted above  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending and we have not experienced a material increase in delinquencies on our residential loans despite clearly weakening housing market conditions 
at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgages arms at rates and terms competitive with market conditions  primarily with the intent of selling these loans into the secondary market 
fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from to years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing 
most arm products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to five years  subject to a limitation on the annual change of to and a lifetime limitation of to 
these arm products most frequently adjust based upon the average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year plus a margin or spread above the index 
generally  arm loans held in our portfolio do not allow for interest only payments nor negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment restrictions 
the retention of arm loans in our loan portfolio can help reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  borrower demand for arm loans versus fixed rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates  the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan 
in recent years  borrower demand for arm loans has been limited and we have chosen not to aggressively pursue arm loans by offering minimally profitable deeply discounted teaser rates or higher interest only option arm products 
as a result  arm loans have represented only a small portion of loans originated during this period and of our portfolio 
our residential loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or fhlmc and the federal national mortgage corporation fannie mae or fnma 
government insured loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the department of housing and urban development hud and the veterans administration va 
in the loan approval process  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the adequacy of the proposed security  the employment stability of the borrower and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
generally  we lend up to of the lesser of the appraised value of the property or purchase price of the property on conventional loans  although higher loan to value ratios are available on certain government insured programs 
we usually require private mortgage insurance on residential loans with a loan to value ratio at origination exceeding 
through our mortgage banking activities  we sell residential loans on either a servicing retained or servicing released basis 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
during the past three years  we have sold a significant portion of our conventional residential mortgage originations and nearly all of our government insured loans into the secondary market 
construction and land lending we invest a significant portion of our loan portfolio in residential construction and land loans to professional home builders and developers 
to a lesser extent  we also originate construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
residential construction and land development lending is a core competency of banner bank and the primary focus of its subsidiary  cfc 
our largest concentration of construction and development loans is in the portland vancouver market area 
we also have a significant amount of construction loans for properties in the puget sound region and to a much smaller extent in the greater boise and certain eastern washington and eastern oregon markets 
at december   construction and land loans totaled billion including million of land or land development loans and million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans  or of total loans of the company 
construction and land lending affords us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than are usually available on other types of lending 
construction and land lending  however  are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than other lending opportunities because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects 
loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan is dependent on the builder s ability to sell the property before the construction loan is due 
we address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies  disbursement procedures and monitoring practices 
construction loans made by us include those with a sale contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may be identified either during or following the construction period 
we actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to ensure an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations 
the maximum number of speculative loans approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors  including the financial capacity of the builder  the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains 
we have chosen to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic area 
loans for the construction of one to four family residences are generally made for a term of twelve months 
our loan policies include maximum loan to value ratios of up to for speculative loans 
individual speculative loan requests are supported by an independent appraisal of the property  a set of plans  a cost breakdown and a completed specifications form 
all speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers 
we also make land loans to developers  builders and individuals to finance the acquisition and or development of improved lots or unimproved land 
in making land loans  we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans 
the initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with interest only payments  payable monthly  and provisions for principal reduction as lots are sold and released from the lien of the mortgage 
we regularly monitor the construction and land loan portfolios and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and decrease this type of lending if we perceive unfavorable market conditions 
although certainly better than other parts of the country  housing markets in most areas of the pacific northwest have clearly weakened over the past six to twelve months and our origination of new construction loans has declined 
we believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place mitigate many of the risks inherent in construction and land lending  however  current slower housing market conditions have resulted in an increase of delinquencies in our construction and land loan portfolios 
while construction and land loans represent of our portfolio and approximately of our non performing assets  they are significantly diversified with respect to geography and sub markets  price ranges and borrowers 
the vast majority of these loans are performing as agreed and we are experiencing continuing loan payoffs and portfolio turnover 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate including  as noted above  loans for construction of multifamily and commercial real estate projects 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and million in commercial real estate loans which together comprised of our total loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate lending affords us an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
however  loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are generally greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  riskier than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in all multifamily and commercial real estate lending  we consider the location  marketability and overall attractiveness of the properties 
our current underwriting guidelines for multifamily and commercial real estate loans require an appraisal from a qualified independent appraiser and an economic analysis of each property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses  debt service coverage and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount 
in the approval process we assess the borrowers willingness and ability to repay the loan and the adequacy of the collateral in relation to the loan amount 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
most multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated in the past five years are linked to various us treasury indices  certain prime rates or other market rate indices 
rates on these adjustable rate loans generally adjust with a frequency of one to five years after an initial fixed rate period ranging from one to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no large concentrations by property type or location 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending  including the origination of loans guaranteed by the small business administration sba  and are engaged to a lesser extent in agricultural lending primarily by providing crop production loans 
our officers devote a great deal of effort to developing customer relationships and the ability to serve these types of borrowers 
management believes that many larger banks have neglected these lending markets  which has contributed to our success 
while strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on middle market corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
management has leveraged the past success of these officers with local decision making ability to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped us increase our deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services is currently an area of significant focus by us and staffing has been increased in the areas of credit administration  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
commercial business loans may entail greater risk than other types of loans 
commercial business loans may be unsecured or secured by special purpose or rapidly depreciating assets  such as equipment  inventory and receivables  which may not provide an adequate source of repayment on defaulted loans 
in addition  commercial business loans are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength and management ability  as well as market conditions for various products  services and commodities 
for these reasons  commercial business loans generally provide higher yields than many other types of loans but also require more administrative and management attention 
loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
we underwrite our commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than on the basis of the underlying collateral value 
we seek to structure these loans so that they have more than one source of repayment 
the borrower is required to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to make a lending determination 
in most instances  this information consists of at least three years of financial statements  tax returns  a statement of projected cash flows  current financial information on any guarantor and information about the collateral 
loans to closely held businesses typically require personal guarantees by the principals 
our commercial loan portfolio is geographically dispersed across the market areas serviced by our branch network and there are no significant concentrations by industry or products 
our commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit 
commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of fixed assets and have maturities of five years or less 
commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year 
adjustable or floating rate loans are generally tied to various prime rate and london inter bank offering rate or libor indices 
at december   commercial loans totaled million  or of our total loans 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many parts of our service areas 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operations of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile 
at december   agricultural business loans  including collateral secured loans to purchase farm land and equipment  totaled million  or of our loan portfolio 
agricultural operating loans generally are made as a percentage of the borrower s anticipated income to support budgeted operating expenses 
these loans generally are secured by a blanket lien on all crops  livestock  equipment  accounts and products and proceeds thereof 
in the case of crops  consideration is given to projected yields and prices from each commodity 
the interest rate is normally floating based on the prime rate as published in the wall street journal  plus a negotiated margin 
because these loans are made to finance a farm or ranch s annual operations  they are written on a one year review and renewable basis 
the renewal is dependent upon the prior year s performance and the forthcoming year s projections as well as the overall financial strength of the borrower 
we carefully monitor these loans and related variance reports on income and expenses compared to budget estimates 
to meet the seasonal operating needs of a farm  borrowers may qualify for single payment notes  revolving lines of credit and or non revolving lines of credit 
in underwriting agricultural operating loans  we consider the cash flow of the borrower based upon the expected operating results as well as the value of collateral used to secure the loans 
collateral generally consists of cash crops produced by the farm  such as milk  grains  fruit  grass seed  peas  sugar beets  mint  onions  potatoes  corn and alfalfa or livestock 
in addition to considering cash flow and obtaining a blanket security interest in the farm s cash crop  we may also collateralize an operating loan with the farm s operating equipment  breeding stock  real estate and federal agricultural program payments to the borrower 
we also originate loans to finance the purchase of farm equipment 
loans to purchase farm equipment are made for terms of up to seven years 
on occasion  we also originate agricultural real estate loans secured primarily by first liens on farmland and improvements thereon located in our market areas  although generally only to service the needs of our existing customers 
loans are written in amounts up to to of the tax assessed or appraised value of the property at terms ranging from five to years 
these loans have interest rates that generally adjust at least every five years based typically upon a us treasury index plus a negotiated margin 
fixed rate loans are granted on terms generally not to exceed five years 
in originating agricultural real estate loans  we consider the debt service coverage of the borrower s cash flow  the appraised value of the underlying property  the experience and knowledge of the borrower  and the borrower s past performance with us and or the market area 
these loans normally are not made to start up businesses but are generally reserved for existing customers with substantial equity and a proven history 
among the more common risks to agricultural lending can be weather conditions and disease 
these risks can be mitigated through multi peril crop insurance 
commodity prices also present a risk  which may be reduced by the use of set price contracts 
normally  required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies 
in addition to these risks  we also consider management succession  life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural loans 
consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business  with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years and management anticipates increased activity in future periods 
part of this emphasis has been the reintroduction of a banner bank funded credit card program which we began marketing in the fourth quarter of similar to other consumer loan programs  we primarily focus this credit card program on our existing customer base to add to the depth of our customer relationships 
as a result of increased marketing efforts  an improved retail delivery network and strong borrower demand  as well as the three bank acquisitions  our consumer loans increased significantly in the past year 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer related loans  an increase of million or from december similar to commercial loans  consumer loans often entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loans such as us  and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
loan solicitation and processing we originate real estate loans in our market areas by direct solicitation of real estate brokers  builders  depositors  walk in customers amd visitors to our internet website 
loan applications are taken by our loan officers and are processed in branch or regional locations 
most underwriting and loan administration functions for our real estate loans are performed by loan personnel at central locations 
our commercial loan officers solicit commercial and agricultural business loans through call programs focused on local businesses and farmers 
while commercial loan officers are delegated reasonable commitment authority based upon their qualifications  credit decisions on significant commercial and agricultural loans are made by senior loan officers or in certain instances by the board of directors of banner bank  islanders bank or banner corporation 
we originate consumer loans through various marketing efforts directed primarily toward our existing deposit and loan customers 
consumer loan applications may be processed at branch locations or by administrative personnel at our main office 
loan originations  sales and purchases while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments  of million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in originations  net of repayments  in the current year is primarily the result of a decrease in the production of new construction and land loans 
in recent years  we generally have sold most of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans and a portion of our sba guaranteed loans to secondary market purchasers as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
sales of loans generally are beneficial to us because these sales may generate income at the time of sale  provide funds for additional lending and other investments and increase liquidity 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
all loans are sold without recourse 
see loan servicing 
at december   we had million in loans held for sale 
we periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market area and at times to support our community reinvestment act lending activities 
any such purchases are made consistent with our underwriting standards  however  the loans may be located outside of our normal lending area 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
loan servicing we receive fees from a variety of institutional owners in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual payments and managing portfolios of sold loans 
at december   we were servicing million of loans for others 
loan servicing includes processing payments  accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related items such as private mortgage insurance 
in addition to earning fee income  we retain certain amounts in escrow for the benefit of the lender for which we incur no interest expense but are able to invest the funds into earning assets 
at december   we held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   million of loan servicing fees  net of  of servicing rights amortization  was recognized in operations 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the cost of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  million  and  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by higher levels of current or anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december   msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization 
asset quality classified assets state and federal regulations require that the banks review and classify their problem assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  state and federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
banner bank s credit policy division reviews detailed information with respect to the composition and performance of the loan portfolios  including information on risk concentrations  delinquencies and classified assets for both banner bank and islanders bank 
the credit policy division approves all recommendations for new classified assets or changes in classifications  and develops and monitors action plans to resolve the problems associated with the assets 
the credit policy division also approves recommendations for establishing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
significant problem loans are transferred to banner bank s special assets department for resolution or collection activities 
the banks and banner corporation s boards of directors are given a detailed report on classified assets and asset quality at least quarterly 
for additional information with respect to asset quality and non performing loans  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality  and table contained therein 
allowance for loan losses in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with the generally acceptable accounting principles gaap guidelines 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible loan losses against our income 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of net loans and of non performing loans compared to and  respectively  at december  for additional information concerning our allowance for loan losses  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and provision and allowance for loan losses  and tables and contained therein 
investment activities under washington state law  banks are permitted to invest in various types of marketable securities 
authorized securities include but are not limited to us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies including government sponsored enterprises  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements  federal funds  commercial paper  corporate debt and equity securities and obligations of states and their political subdivisions 
our investment policies are designed to provide and maintain adequate liquidity and to generate favorable rates of return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk 
our policies generally limit investments to us government and government agency including government sponsored entities securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  marketable corporate debt obligations and mortgage backed securities 
investment in mortgage backed securities may include those issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  government national mortgage association ginnie mae or gnma and privately issued mortgage backed securities that have an aa credit rating or higher  as well as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
a high credit rating indicates only that the rating agency believes there is a low risk of loss or default 
to the best of our knowledge  we do not have any investments in mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles that have a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
however  all of our investment securities  including those that have high credit ratings  are subject to market risk in so far as a change in market rates of interest or other conditions may cause a change in an investment s earning performance and or market value 
at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  and stock of fannie mae and freddie mac 
from time to time  investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives  and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in loan originations  deposits and other activities 
during the year ended december   investments and securities decreased by million 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  recent developments and significant events 
during the year ended december   holdings of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million  us treasury and agency obligations increased million to million  corporate and other securities increased million to million  and municipal bonds decreased million to million 
for detailed information on our investment securities  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and investments  and tables   and contained therein 
off balance sheet derivatives derivatives include off balance sheet financial products whose value is dependent on the value of an underlying financial asset  such as a stock  bond  foreign currency  or a reference rate or index 
such derivatives include forwards  futures  options or swaps 
we generally have not invested in off balance sheet derivative instruments  although investment policies authorize such investments 
however  through our acquisition of f m we became a party to approximately million million as of december  in notional amounts of interest rate swaps 
these swaps serve as hedges to an equal amount of fixed rate loans which include market value prepayment penalties that mirror the provision of the specifically matched interest rate swaps 
the fair value adjustments for these swaps and the related loans are reflected in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate  and in the carrying value of the hedged loans 
also  as a part of mortgage banking activities  we issue rate lock commitments to borrowers and obtain offsetting best efforts delivery commitments from purchasers of loans 
while not providing any trading or net settlement mechanisms  these off balance sheet commitments do have many of the prescribed characteristics of derivatives and as a result are accounted for as such in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
accordingly  on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
on december   we had no other investment related off balance sheet derivatives 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general deposits  fhlb advances or other borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced by general economic  interest rate and money market conditions and may vary significantly 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes  including funding loans and investments 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our recent branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances  and we have enjoyed strong deposit growth in recent years 
in addition  our electronic banking activities including debit card and automated teller machine atm programs  online internet banking services and  most recently  customer remote deposit capabilities are all directed at providing products and services that enhance customer relationships and result in growing deposit balances 
growing deposits is a fundamental element of our core business strategies 
deposit accounts we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability to us  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits 
for additional information concerning our deposit accounts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and deposit accounts 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the balances of deposits in the various types of accounts offered by us  and table  which sets forth the amount of our certificates of deposit greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december  borrowings while deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes  we also use borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to more efficiently leverage our capital position 
the fhlb seattle serves as our primary borrowing source 
the fhlb seattle provides credit for member financial institutions such as banner bank and islanders bank 
as members  the banks are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of their mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
at december   we had million of combined borrowings from the fhlb seattle at a weighted average rate of 
at that date  banner bank had been authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to million under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement 
the banks also have access to additional short term funds through million in commercial bank credit lines 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on these commercial banking credit lines 
for additional information concerning our borrowings from the fhlb seattle  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and borrowings  table contained therein  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we issue retail repurchase agreements  generally due within days  as an additional source of funds  primarily in connection with cash management services provided to our larger deposit customers 
at december   we had issued retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average interest rate of  which were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities with a market value of million 
we also may borrow funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
however  we did not have any wholesale repurchase borrowings at december  in these instances  the broker holds our investment securities while we continue to receive the principal and interest payments from the securities 
in addition to our borrowings  we have also issued million of trust preferred securities tps 
the tps were issued in     and by special purpose business trusts formed by banner corporation and were sold in private offerings to pooled investment vehicles 
the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition  however  at december   all of the tps qualify as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
we have invested a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the tps as additional paid in capital at banner bank 
for additional information about deposits and other sources of funds  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item personnel as of december   we had  full time and part time employees 
banner corporation has no employees except for those who are also employees of banner bank  its subsidiaries  and islanders bank 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
taxation federal taxation general for tax reporting purposes  we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting on a consolidated basis 
we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for additional information concerning the income taxes payable by us 
provisions of the small business job protection act of the job protection act significantly altered our tax bad debt deduction method and the circumstances that would require a tax bad debt reserve recapture 
prior to enactment of the job protection act  savings institutions banner bank was previously chartered as a savings institution were permitted to compute their tax bad debt deduction through use of either the reserve method or the percentage of taxable income method 
the job protection act repealed both of these methods for large savings institutions and allows bad debt deductions based only on actual current losses 
while repealing the reserve method for computing tax bad debt deductions  the job protection act allowed savings institutions to retain their existing base year bad debt reserves but required that reserves in excess of the balance at december   be recaptured into taxable income over six years 
the reserves in excess of the base year december  had been fully recaptured into taxable income as of december  the base year reserve is recaptured into taxable income only in limited situations  such as in the event of certain excess distributions  complete liquidation or disqualification as a bank 
none of the limited circumstances requiring recapture are contemplated by us 
the amount of our tax bad debt reserves subject to recapture in these circumstances was approximately million at december  as a result of the remote nature of events that may trigger the recapture provisions  no tax liability has been established in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
state taxation washington taxation we are subject to a business and occupation b o tax which is imposed under washington law at the rate of of gross receipts  however  interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties  residential mortgage backed securities  and certain us government and agency securities is not subject to such tax 
our b o tax expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oregon and idaho taxation corporations with nexus in the states of oregon and idaho are subject to a corporate level income tax 
our operations in those states resulted in corporate income taxes of approximately   and  net of federal tax benefit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for  corporate income taxes for oregon were reduced approximately  due to a one time biannual state credit that is not guaranteed to be repeated 
in addition  for our oregon and idaho taxes also decreased as a result of the overall decrease in pre tax book income due to balance sheet restructuring transactions 
as our operations in these states increase  the state income tax provision will have an increasing effect on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
environmental regulation our business is affected from time to time by federal and state laws and regulations relating to hazardous substances 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  owners and operators of properties containing hazardous substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the substances 
cercla and similar state laws can affect us both as an owner of branches and other properties used in our business and as a lender holding a security interest in property which is found to contain hazardous substances 
while cercla contains an exemption for holders of security interests  the exemption is not available if the holder participates in the management of a property  and some courts have broadly defined what constitutes participation in management of property 
moreover  cercla and similar state statutes can affect our decision whether or not to foreclose on a property 
before foreclosing on commercial real estate  our general policy is to obtain an environmental report  thereby increasing the costs of foreclosure 
in addition  the existence of hazardous substances on a property securing a troubled loan may cause us to elect not to foreclose on the property  thereby reducing our flexibility in handling the loan 
competition we encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial and savings banks  savings associations and credit unions with offices in our market areas 
we also experience competition from securities firms  insurance companies  money market and mutual funds  and other investment vehicles 
we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future  including increasing competition from on line internet banking competitors 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to provide transaction services and investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of depositors 
we compete for deposits by offering a variety of accounts and financial services  including robust electronic banking capabilities  with competitive rates and terms  at convenient locations and business hours  and delivered with a high level of personal service and expertise 
competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks  loan brokers  mortgage banking companies  savings banks and credit unions 
the competition for loans is intense as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas 
we compete for loans primarily by offering competitive rates and fees and providing timely decisions and excellent service to borrowers 
regulation banner bank and islanders bank general as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  banner bank and islanders bank the banks are subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements  including prescribed minimum capital standards 
the banks are regularly examined by the fdic and state banking regulators and file periodic reports concerning their activities and financial condition with the regulators 
the banks relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law  especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the banks  including reserves  loans  investments  deposits  capital  issuance of securities  payment of dividends and establishment of branches 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
the respective primary federal regulators of banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
state regulation and supervision as a washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  banner bank is subject to the applicable provisions of washington  oregon and idaho law and regulations 
state law and regulations govern banner bank s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon  to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate  to make consumer loans  to invest in securities  to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices 
in a similar fashion  washington state laws and regulations apply to islanders bank 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits  up to applicable limits  of depository institutions 
as insurer of the banks deposits  the fdic has examination  supervisory and enforcement authority over banner bank and islanders bank 
the deposits of the banks are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  or dif  which is administered by the fdic 
the fdic insures deposits up to the applicable limits and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the fdic 
it also may prohibit any institution insured by the fdic from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
under regulations effective january   the fdic adopted a new risk based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution s ranking in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations 
well capitalized institutions generally those with capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk  or camels  composite ratings of or are grouped in risk category i and assessed for deposit insurance at an annual rate between five and seven basis points 
the assessment rate for an individual institution is determined according to a formula based on a weighted average of the institution s individual camels component ratings and either five financial ratios or  in the case of an institution with assets of billion or more  the average ratings of its long term debt 
institutions in risk categories ii  iii and iv are assessed at annual rates of   and basis points  respectively 
further  the fdic issued one time assessment credits that could be used to offset this new risk based expense 
banner bank s total credits were utilized against assessments and covered the majority of those assessments 
banner bank does not have any remaining credits to offset assessments in islanders bank s total credits covered all of its assessments and are expected to cover one additional quarter in absent those credits for most of  even without any increases in the assessment rate  the company s earnings will be materially affected by the addition of fdic expenses 
insured institutions are required to pay a financing corporation assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the s 
for the semi annual period ended december   the financing corporation assessment equaled basis points for each in domestic deposits 
these assessments  which may be revised based upon the level of dif deposits  will continue until the bonds mature in the years through for  the banks incurred  in fico assessments 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of either banner bank or islanders bank 
prompt corrective action federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements  regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized 
failure by either bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would  if unremedied  result in restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
additionally  approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements 
at december   both banner bank and islanders bank were categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the fdic 
capital requirements federally insured financial institutions  such as banner bank and islanders bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core tier capital and supplementary tier capital 
tier capital generally includes common stockholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less most intangible assets 
tier capital  which is limited to of tier capital  includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible debt  term subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock  however  the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock original maturity of at least five years but less than years that may in included in tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the fdic currently measures an institution s capital using a leverage limit together with certain risk based ratios 
the fdic s minimum leverage capital requirement specifies a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets 
most banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least to of total assets 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier leverage capital ratios of and  respectively 
the fdic retains the right to require a particular institution to maintain a higher capital level based on an institution s particular risk profile 
fdic regulations also establish a measure of capital adequacy based on ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of the category 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts  and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories 
under the guidelines  the ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least  and the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least 
in evaluating the adequacy of a bank s capital  the fdic may also consider other factors that may affect the bank s financial condition 
such factors may include interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentration of credit risk  risks arising from nontraditional activities  loan and investment quality  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s ability to monitor and control financial operating risks 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
the washington department of financial institutions requires that net worth equal at least of total assets 
intangible assets must be deducted from net worth and assets when computing compliance with this requirement 
at december   banner bank had a net worth of of total assets under this standard  while islanders bank had a similarly calculated net worth of 
fdic capital requirements are designated as the minimum acceptable standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound  which are well managed and have no material or significant financial weaknesses 
the fdic capital regulations state that  where the fdic determines that the financial history or condition  including off balance sheet risk  managerial resources and or the future earnings prospects of a bank are not adequate and or a bank has a significant volume of assets classified substandard  doubtful or loss or otherwise criticized  the fdic may determine that the minimum adequate amount of capital for the bank is greater than the minimum standards established in the regulation 
we believe that  under the current regulations  banner bank and islanders bank exceed their minimum capital requirements 
however  events beyond the control of the banks  such as weak or depressed economic conditions in areas where they have most of their loans  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the banks to meet their capital requirements 
for additional information concerning banner bank s and islanders bank s capital  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed  by regulation  guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if the fdic determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines  it may require an institution to submit to the fdic an acceptable plan to achieve compliance 
we believe that at december   banner bank and islanders bank met all of the fdic guidelines 
activities and investments of insured state chartered financial institutions federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of fdic insured  state chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks 
an insured state bank is not prohibited from  among other things  acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary  investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition  rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project  provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed of the bank s total assets  acquiring up to of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors  trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions  and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met 
washington state has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity 
primarily  the law affords washington chartered commercial banks the same powers as washington chartered savings banks 
in order for a bank to exercise these powers  it must provide days notice to the director of the washington department of financial institutions and the director must authorize the requested activity 
in addition  the law provides that washington chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers that the federal reserve has determined to be closely related to the business of banking and the powers of national banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations 
the law also provides that washington chartered savings banks may exercise any of the powers of washington chartered commercial banks  national banks and federally chartered savings banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations 
finally  the law provides additional flexibility for washington chartered commercial and savings banks with respect to interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit 
specifically  they may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally chartered financial institutions to washington residents 
federal reserve system the federal reserve board requires  under regulation d  reserves on all depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits 
these reserves may be in the form of cash or non interest bearing deposits with the regional federal reserve bank 
now accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to regulation d reserve requirements  as are any nonpersonal time deposits at a bank 
under regulation d  at the end of  an institution was required to establish reserves equal to of the first million of transaction accounts  of which the first million was exempt  and of the remainder 
similarly  islanders bank was also required to establish reserves equal to of the first million of transaction accounts  of which the first million was exempt  and of the remainder 
currently there is no reserve requirement on nonpersonal time deposits 
as of december   the banks met their reserve requirements 
affiliate transactions banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank are separate and distinct legal entities 
various legal limitations restrict the banks from lending or otherwise supplying funds to us an affiliate  generally limiting such transactions with the affiliate to of the bank s capital and surplus and limiting all such transactions to of the bank s capital and surplus and requiring eligible collateral to secure a loan to an affiliate 
such transactions  including extensions of credit  sales of securities or assets and provision of services  also must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices  including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to banner bank or islanders bank as those prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies 
federally insured banks are subject  with certain exceptions  to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates  on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower 
in addition  such banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service 
community reinvestment act banner bank and islanders bank are also subject to the provisions of the community reinvestment act of  which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank s record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulatory agency s assessment of the bank s record is made available to the public 
further  a bank s performance under the cra must be considered in connection with a bank s application to  among other things  to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits  relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with  or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of  a federally regulated financial institution 
both banner bank and islanders bank received a satisfactory rating during their most recent examinations 
dividends dividends from banner bank and islanders bank constitute the major source of funds for dividends paid by us to our shareholders 
the amount of dividends payable by the banks to us will depend upon their earnings and capital position  and is limited by federal and state laws  regulations and policies 
federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution which includes a cash dividend if  after making the distribution  the institution would be undercapitalized  as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations 
moreover  the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice

interstate banking and branching the federal reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of  or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of  a bank located in a state other than the holding company s home state  without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state 
the federal reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period not exceeding five years specified by the statutory law of the host state 
nor may the federal reserve approve an application if the applicant and its depository institution affiliates controls or would control more than of the insured deposits in the united states or or more of the deposits in the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
individual states may also waive the state wide concentration limit contained in the federal law 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to june  which applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks 
interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions 
interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above 
dividends the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws  a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
capital requirements the federal reserve has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements of the fdic for the banks  although the federal reserve regulations provide for the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities for up to of tier capital in determining compliance with the guidelines 
the federal reserve regulations provide that capital standards will be applied on a consolidated basis in the case of a bank holding company with million or more in total consolidated assets 
the guidelines require that a company s total risk based capital must equal of risk weighted assets and one half of the must consist of tier core capital 
as of december   banner corporation s total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets and its tier core capital was of risk weighted assets 
stock repurchases a bank holding company  except for certain well capitalized and highly rated bank holding companies  is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to or more of its consolidated net worth the federal reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve order or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve

item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below  other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities are mismatched and subject us to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our net earnings and economic value 
our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
significant changes in market interest rates or errors or misjudgments in our interest rate risk management procedures could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and economic value 
we currently believe that declining interest rates will adversely affect our near term net earnings 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on our earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for our rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income and net market value of equity resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
we update and prepare our simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and our directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net market value of our equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used and  as a result  our interest rate risk management strategies may prove to be inadequate 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and market risk and asset liability management for additional information concerning interest rate risk 
our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
we originate construction and land loans  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural loans as well as residential mortgage loans primarily within our market areas 
generally  the types of loans other than the residential mortgage loans have a higher risk of loss than the residential mortgage loans 
we had approximately billion outstanding in these types of higher risk loans at december   which is a significant increase since december  these loans have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons and the reasons discussed under item  business lending activities construction and land loans 
this type of lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
in addition  speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre sold  and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences 
loans on land under development or held for future construction also poses additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the security 
these risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions 
as a result  this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
during the years ended december  and  we significantly increased our origination of construction and land loans 
while new construction loan originations decreased by approximately in  we continue to have a significant investment in construction loan balances 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans  and repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service  which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment 
commercial business loans 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
the borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates among others 
collateral securing these loans may be difficult to evaluate  manage or liquidate and may not provide an adequate source of repayment 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
for additional information  see item i  business lending and item  management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of or borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and the loss and delinquency experience  and evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in the need for additions to our allowance 
material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may face risks with respect to our recent acquisitions and future expansion 
we have recently completed three acquisitions and may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future 
we also plan to continue to engage in additional de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities  including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders and to investors purchasing common stock 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisition  our integration efforts will be successful or our company  after giving effect to the acquisition  will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
there is no assurance that the change in the mix of our assets and liabilities will improve our operating results 
in addition to lending and deposit gathering activities  we previously emphasized investments in government agency and mortgage backed securities  funded with wholesale borrowings 
this policy was designed to enhance profitability by allowing asset growth with low overhead expense  although securities generally have lower yields than loans  resulting in a lower interest rate spread and lower interest income 
in recent years  we have pursued a strategy to change the mix of our assets and liabilities to have proportionately more loans and fewer securities and more customer deposits  particularly transaction and savings deposits  and fewer borrowings 
our implementation of this strategy has included significant loan and deposit growth and was accelerated by a series of balance sheet restructuring transactions which we executed in the fourth quarter of while the objective of this strategy  including the balance sheet restructuring  is to improve our net interest income and net income in future periods through an enhanced net interest margin  there is no assurance that this strategy will succeed 
see item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information concerning implementation of this strategy 
if we are not able to achieve profitability on new branches it may negatively affect our earnings 
we have expanded our presence throughout the market area  and intend to pursue further expansion by opening additional new branches 
the profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches 
largely as a result of this de novo branching strategy  our operating expenses have increased significantly  adversely affecting our operating efficiency 
as a result  the efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of non interest expense to net interest income and other income  is higher than many of our competitor institutions 
we expect that it may take a period of time before certain of these branches can become profitable  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
during this period  the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income 
if external funds were not available  this could adversely impact our growth and prospects 
we rely on deposits and advances from the fhlb of seattle and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition or the financial condition of the fhlb of seattle or market conditions were to change 
although we consider such sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long term business objectives 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our growth and future prospects could be adversely affected 
our growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth  both internally and through acquisitions 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the states of washington  oregon and idaho and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers located primarily in these three states 
the local economic conditions in our market areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
adverse economic conditions unique to these northwest markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets  increases in credit costs or other factors could impact these state and local markets and  in turn  also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
during  the housing market in the united states began to experience significant adverse trends  including accelerated price depreciation in some markets and rising delinquency and default rates 
as a result of these trends  we saw an increase in delinquency and default rates particularly on construction and land loans in our primary market areas 
these trends if they continue or worsen could cause further credit losses and loan loss provisioning and could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete in our market areas with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets 
for additional information see item  business competition 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision  primarily through banner bank and islanders bank and certain non bank subsidiaries 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
see item  business regulation 
the level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny 
the fdic  the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency  have recently promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
under the guidance  a financial institution actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations 
a financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if  among other factors  i total reported loans for construction  land development  and other land represent or more of total capital or ii total reported loans secured by multifamily and non farm residential properties  loans for construction  land development and other land and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market  including loans to commercial real estate related entities  represent or more of total capital 
management should also employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning  development of underwriting standards  risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing 
while we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with the guidance  bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance which could result in additional costs to us 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on dividends from subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
banner corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that banner bank  islanders bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to banner corporation 
also  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event the banks are unable to pay dividends to banner corporation  we may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on banner corporation s common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the banks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item  business regulation 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  and  as a result  investors and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could adversely affect our business  the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits 
in connection with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of act and the implementation of the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the act 
this requires us to prepare an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting  including among other matters  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
if we fail to identify and correct any significant deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud  current and potential shareholders and depositors could lose confidence in our internal controls and financial reporting  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits

sixty two branches are located in washington  fourteen in oregon and eight in idaho 
of those offices  approximately half are owned and the other half are leased facilities 
we also have twelve leased locations for loan production offices spread throughout the same three state area 
the lease terms for our branch and loan production offices are not individually material 
lease expirations range from one to years 
administrative support offices are primarily in washington  where we have facilities  of which we own four and lease seven 
additionally we have one leased administrative support office in idaho and two in oregon 
in the opinion of management  all properties are adequately covered by insurance  are in a good state of repair and are appropriately designed for their present and future use 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have various legal proceedings and other contingent matters outstanding 
these proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable 
these claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to action to enforce liens on properties in which we hold a security interest 
we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that they believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
there have not been any internal revenue service audits of our federal income tax returns during the past five years

under federal regulations  the dollar amount of dividends the banks may pay depends upon their capital position and recent net income 
generally  if the bank satisfies its regulatory capital requirements  it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed under state law and fdic regulations 
however  an institution that has converted to a stock form of ownership may not declare or pay a dividend on  or repurchase any of  its common stock if the effect thereof would cause the regulatory capital of the institution to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established in connection with the conversion 
under washington law  we are prohibited from paying a dividend if  as a result of its payment  we would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the normal course of business  or if our total liabilities would exceed our total assets 
payments of the distributions on our trust preferred securities from the special purpose subsidiary trusts we sponsored are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
the junior subordinated debentures that we have issued to our subsidiary trusts are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make required payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the interest and principal obligations under the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we may defer the payment of interest on each of the junior subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters  provided that the deferral period does not extend beyond the stated maturity 
during such deferral period  distributions on the corresponding trust preferred securities will also be deferred and we may not pay cash dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington 
we are primarily engaged in the business of planning  directing and coordinating the business activities of our wholly owned subsidiaries  banner bank and  subsequent to may   islanders bank  a recent acquisition  as explained below 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and  as of december   its branch offices and loan production offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
islanders bank is also a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from three locations in san juan county  washington 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
the banks primary business is that of traditional banking institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding their offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
lending activities include commercial business and commercial real estate loans  agriculture business loans  construction and land development loans  one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
branch expansion has been a significant element in our strategy to grow loans  deposits and customer relationships 
over the past several years  we have invested significantly in expanding our branch and distributions systems with a primary emphasis on expanding our presence in the four largest areas of commerce in the northwest the puget sound region of washington and the greater boise  idaho  portland  oregon  and spokane  washington markets 
as a result of our aggressive franchise expansion  we have added new branches through acquisitions  opened new branches and relocated eight others in the last three years 
in alone  we opened ten branches  relocated five others and closed three acquisitions 
in large part because of this expansion activity  we have experienced loan growth of billion and deposit growth of billion over the last three year period 
the acquisitions and new branches have increased our presence within desirable markets and allow us to better serve existing and future customers 
this emphasis on growth has resulted in an elevated level of operating expenses  however  we believe that over time these new branches should help improve profitability by providing lower cost core deposits which will allow us to proportionately reduce higher cost borrowings as a source of funds 
we now have reached our goal in terms of the number of branches required to generate deposit growth sufficient to fund our expected loan growth and produce significant fee generating opportunities 
as a result  we plan to open only three additional branches in  a normal level of growth for a bank of our size 
we completed the acquisitions of f m bank and san juan financial holding company effective may   and ncw community bank effective october  san juan financial holding company was merged into banner corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  islanders bank  has continued operations as a subsidiary of banner corporation 
f m bank and ncw community bank were merged into banner bank upon acquisition and now operate under the banner bank name 
the financial results for the year ended december  include the assets  liabilities and results of operations for all three of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates of may  and october  our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  composed primarily of customer deposits  fhlb advances  other borrowings and junior subordinated debentures 
net interest income is primarily a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million for the year ended december  to million as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of significant growth in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  including growth resulting from the three acquisitions  and as a result of changes in the mix of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our net income also is affected by provisions for loan losses and the level of our other income  including deposit service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our operating expenses and income tax provisions 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses in the current year reflects an increase in delinquencies and non performing loans  balanced against slower growth in the size of the loan portfolio  excluding the effects of the mergers  continuing changes in the loan mix and a modest level of net charge offs 
other operating income  excluding the fair value adjustments  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased deposit fees and other service charges reflecting in part the recent acquisitions 
revenues net interest income before the provision for loan losses plus other operating income  excluding the gain on sale of securities and fair value adjustments  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  other operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for  an increase of from a year earlier  largely reflecting our continued growth and the effect of our acquisitions 
other operating expenses in the prior year were reduced by a million net of costs insurance recovery 
without the recovery  those expenses would have been million for the year ended december  excluding the insurance recovery  recurring other operating expenses for the year ended december  would have increased by million from million in  a increase that was largely driven by the franchise expansion strategy  including the effect of the acquisitions 
net income increased by million to million for the year ended december   while earnings from recurring operations see following paragraph  exclusive of the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and the insurance recovery  increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the modest increase in earnings from recurring operations despite a much larger earning asset base primarily reflects a moderately narrower net interest margin and a higher level of operating expenses as a result of the new branches and integration activities associated with the acquisitions 
earnings from recurring operations and other earnings information excluding the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and the insurance recovery represent non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures 
management has presented these non gaap financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes that they provide more useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations 
where applicable  we have also presented comparable earnings information using gaap financial measures 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers  however  we do not now and have not previously engaged in any sub prime lending 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties 
our lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
we have also recently increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans is still relatively small 
while continuing our commitment to construction and residential lending  we expect commercial lending including commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural loans and consumer lending to become increasingly important activities for us 
deposits  including customer retail repurchase agreements  and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our recent branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability  matching deposit and loan products  and customer preferences and concerns 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related interim consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to i the methodology for the recognition of interest income  ii determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses and iii the valuation of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  goodwill  mortgage servicing rights and real estate held for sale 
these policies and judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail below in management s discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition 
there have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since december   except for the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and discussed below 
for additional information  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
adoption and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements banner corporation elected early adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  and sfas no 
 fair value measurements  effective january  sfas no 
 which was issued in february  generally permits the measurement of selected eligible financial instruments at fair value at specified election dates 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
we made this election to allow more flexibility with respect to the management of our investment securities  wholesale borrowings and interest rate risk position in future periods 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on january   we adopted fin currently  we are subject to us federal income tax and income tax of the states of idaho and oregon 
the years through remain open to examination for federal income taxes and state income taxes 
as of january  and december   we believe we had insignificant unrecognized tax benefits or uncertain tax positions 
in addition  we have no material accrued interest or penalties as of january  or december  it is our policy to record interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
the amount of interest and penalties for the year ended december  was immaterial 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the statement specifies under what situations servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be recognized 
it requires these assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and specifies acceptable measurement methods subsequent to their recognition 
separate presentation in the financial statements and additional disclosures are also required 
this statement became effective january  the adoption of the statement has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general total assets increased billion  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  recent acquisitions on may  and october  contributed million in assets  while the remaining increase largely resulted from growth in the loan portfolio and was funded primarily by deposit growth 
net loans receivable gross loans less loans in process  deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  internal loan growth was substantial and broad based  however  the portfolio growth largely reflects the million of loans acquired as of the closing dates of may and october  through the purchases of f m  sjfhc and ncw 
although internally generated production of new loans declined appreciably in the second half of  we continue to maintain a significant investment in construction and land loans  reflecting a core competency of banner bank 
including the effect of the acquisitions  loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential real estate increased by million  or  and land and development loans increased by million  or  since december  in addition  and largely reflecting the acquisitions  loans to finance commercial real estate increased by million  or  while loans secured by multi family real estate increased by million  or 
loan growth also included commercial business loans  which increased by million  or  consumer loans  which increased by million  or  and loans to finance existing one to four family residential properties  which increased by million  or  at december  compared to december  by contrast  at december  loans to finance commercial and multifamily construction decreased by million  or  from december  securities decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december   as sales and repayments exceeded purchases and the million added as a result of the acquisitions 
effective january   we elected to reclassify all our securities available for sale to fair value following our adoption of sfas no 
at december   the amortized cost of our securities available for sale  which are carried at fair value  exceeded their fair value by million 
property and equipment increased by million to million at december   from million at december  the increase included additional site  construction and equipment costs associated with new facilities recently opened or in progress as part of our continuing branch expansion strategy  and million added through recent acquisitions 
we also had an increase of million in bank owned life insurance  with nearly million coming from the growth of cash surrender values on existing policies and the remainder as a result of the acquisitions 
deposits increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the acquisitions of f m  sjfhc and ncw resulted in the addition of million in total deposits as of the acquisition dates 
non interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million  while interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  the aggregate total of transaction and savings accounts  including money market accounts  increased by million  or  to billion  reflecting our focused efforts to grow these important core deposits  as well as the effects of the acquisitions 
increasing core deposits is a key element of our expansion strategy  including the recent and planned additions and renovations of branch locations 
reflecting internally generated growth and the effects of the acquisitions  transaction and savings accounts represent of total deposits at december   compared to a year earlier 
fhlb advances decreased million from million at december   to million at december   while other borrowings decreased million to million at december  the decrease in other borrowings reflects an increase of million in retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts  as well as a decrease of million of repurchase agreement borrowings from securities dealers 
junior subordinated debentures decreased by million  primarily reflecting the cumulative fair value adjustments recorded subsequent to the adoption of sfas  as recent changes in credit market conditions had a particularly significant impact on this type of securities 
during the year ended december   we increased our capital by issuing  new shares of banner corporation common stock at an average net price of through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase and sale plan 
in addition  we issued a net  shares in connection with the exercise and forfeiture of vested stock options and grants  and  shares were issued in the acquisitions of f m  sjfnc and ncw 
this stock issuance  combined with the changes in retained earnings as a result of operations and the effects of fair value accounting  net of quarterly dividend distributions  resulted in a million increase in stockholders equity 
investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  and freddie mac stock 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   investment securities decreased by million million excluding acquisitions as we redeployed cash flow from securities to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings 
holdings of mortgage backed securities decreased million and us treasury and agency obligations increased million 
ownership of corporate and other securities increased million  largely as a result of the purchase of approximately million of trust preferred securities issued by other financial institutions  while municipal bonds increased million 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities totaled million  or of the consolidated investment portfolio 
included within this amount were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with a net carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities at december  was million  which is million less than the amortized cost of million 
at december   our portfolio of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a weighted average coupon rate of 
at that date  of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of the portfolio was years 
we do not believe that any of our mortgage backed obligations had a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
municipal bonds our tax exempt municipal bond portfolio at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost 
at december   general obligation bonds and revenue bonds had total estimated fair values of million and million  respectively 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a portion of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio had a weighted average maturity of approximately years  an average coupon rate of and an average taxable equivalent yield of 
the largest principal balance of any security in the municipal portfolio was a general obligation bond issued by the public hospital district no 
 columbia and walla walla counties  washington  with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which totaled million at fair value million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of intermediate term fixed rate securities issued by a finance company and long term fixed and adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions 
at december   the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a fair value of million million at amortized cost at december   a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity

loans lending our net loan portfolio increased million  or  million was added through acquisitions  during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or  during the year ended december  and an increase of million in the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
during the past three years  the low level of market interest rates and increasing real estate values led to very strong demand for new real estate loans  including construction loans  however  starting in the summer of  sales of new homes in the markets we serve slowed appreciably  which significantly reduced the demand for new construction and land development loans and slowed our portfolio growth compared to prior years 
by contrast  demand for and our production of commercial business loans strengthened somewhat during the second half of for the years ended december   and  we originated  net of repayments  million  million and million of loans  respectively 
in recent years  we generally have sold most of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
loans held for sale decreased slightly to million at december   compared to million at december  at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where we have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
despite softening markets in the second half of the year  continued in migration and strong employment gains in the northwest and the still relatively low mortgage interest rate environment in sustained demand for residential loans  permitting us to originate a combined total of million of one to four family residential loans for the year ended december  the loan sales noted above  coupled with principal repayments  offset much of the increase from current year acquisitions and origination activity  resulting in a million increase in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
construction and land lending a significant proportion of our loan portfolio consists of residential construction loans to professional home builders and  to a lesser extent  land loans and construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
in  in response to softening housing markets  higher mortgage rates and tighter credit standards  we significantly slowed our construction and development lending as the year progressed 
nevertheless  at december   construction and land loans totaled billion including million of land or land development loans and million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans  or of total loans  compared to billion  or  at december  construction and land development loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease compared to billion for the year ended december  the geographic distribution of our construction and land development loans is approximately in the greater puget sound market  in the greater portland  oregon market  and in the greater boise  idaho market  with the remaining distributed in various eastern washington and eastern oregon markets we serve 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  however  growth in these loan types was somewhat limited as certain competitors were willing to offer longer term fixed rate loans at interest rate levels that were lower than our investment objectives 
combined growth for these loan types was million for the year with much of that resulting from the acquisitions 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and million in commercial real estate loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans comprised of total loans at december   compared to a year earlier 
commercial lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
while continuing and strengthening our commitment to small business lending  we also have experienced officers and staff focused on middle market corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
we have leveraged the skills and relationships of these officers with responsive local decision making authority to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase the deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services has been an area of significant focus and staffing has been increased in the areas of credit administration  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
reflecting this effort along with the balances received through our acquisitions  for the year ended december   commercial business loans increased by 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we routinely make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
generally  in  weather conditions  production levels and market prices were quite good for our agricultural borrowers 
at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts and  although the balances are not currently significant  in we reintroduced credit card lending to our consumer loan products 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years 
this increased effort along with the impact of current acquisitions allowed non real estate related consumer loans to increase meaningfully despite continuing high levels of prepayments 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in non real estate secured consumer loans  compared to million  or  at december  in addition  consumer loans secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit  increased by million to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at december  while consumer loans remain a relatively small portion of the loan portfolio  aggregate growth was in and we anticipate increased consumer loan activity in future periods as our branch network and retail customer base continue to grow 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing million of loans for others  compared to million at december  the loan servicing portfolio at december  included million of freddie mac mortgage loans  million of fannie mae mortgage loans and million of loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   million of loan servicing fees  net of  of servicing rights amortization  was recognized in operations 
for the prior year  net loan servicing fees were million 
the increased servicing income for the current year primarily reflects an increase loan servicing fees  a greater level of late charge fees and growth through acquisitions 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the cost of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  million and  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by current and anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december  and  msrs were carried at a value  net of amortization  of and million  respectively

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits  of which billion had remaining maturities of one year or less 
total deposits increased by million  or  for the year ended december   including million of deposits acquired through acquisitions 
as illustrated in the following table  we have added significantly to total transaction accounts demand  now  savings and money market accounts since total transaction accounts increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this includes non interest bearing transaction accounts  which increased by  or million  over the same time period 
however  also as reflected in the table  certificates of deposit have accounted for a larger percentage of the deposit portfolio than have transaction accounts  and in certificates of deposit increased 
in addition  we offer a money market certificate of deposit which has limited withdrawal features but functions much like a savings account and competes effectively with our competitors money market accounts 
at december   we had million in three month maturity money market certificates of deposit  compared to million at december  further  although not included in deposit balances  in we had an increase of million in retail repurchase agreements  which are customer funds that are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements tied to transaction accounts 
while increased use of these cash management services has the effect of reducing transaction account balances  it contributes to increased deposit fee revenues 
deposit balances at december  also included million of public funds owned by various counties  municipalities and other public entities in washington  oregon and idaho  compared to million at december  growing deposits in general and transaction accounts in particular is a core element of our business plan and is a primary focus of our recent and ongoing branch expansion  relocation and renovation activities as well as the increased advertising and marketing campaigns

at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million 
retail repurchase agreement balances increased by million during  largely as a result of increased use of our cash management services by commercial deposit customers

at december   the tps had a weighted average rate of asset quality we have always placed a strong emphasis on managing our asset quality by applying a disciplined approach to credit approval and monitoring for signs of deterioration in loan quality 
nonetheless  although asset quality was very good for the previous three years  for the year ended december   we experienced a meaningful increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  primarily construction and land development loans for one to four family residential properties  as well as modestly higher net charge offs 
this higher level of delinquencies and non accruals had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues  increased loan loss provisioning and increased loan collection costs 
however  the level of net charge offs remained reasonable and we continue to build our reserves for possible loan losses 
non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  at december   compared to million  or of total assets  december   and million  or of total assets  at december  generally  non performing loans and assets reflect unique operating difficulties for individual borrowers rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  although slower sales and excess inventory in certain housing markets has been a clear contributing factor to the increase in delinquencies 
however  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending programs and have not been directly impacted by the asset quality issues emanating from that market segment 
nevertheless  we do share others heightened concerns relative to home values  housing markets and construction lending as a result of the problems associated with sub prime and other non traditional mortgage lending programs  and are currently exercising extra monitoring vigilance with respect to our asset quality 
aside from residential construction and development lending  to date we have not detected any meaningful deterioration in the performance or quality of any other segments of our loan portfolio 
we believe our level of non performing loans and assets is very manageable  the underlying asset values remain sufficient to minimize principal losses and our reserves are satisfactory 
at december   our largest non performing loan exposure was for a land development project totaling million secured by acres of undeveloped land near boise  idaho 
the second largest non performing loan exposure was for a residential land development loan totaling million secured by a project in salem  oregon 
this project contains fully developed and marketable single family building lots 
we acquired title to this property through foreclosure on january   and are optimistic about the prospects for a sale 
the third largest non performing loan exposure  totaling million  was also for a residential development project and is secured by a finished  lot residential plat in vancouver  washington 
we only have three additional non performing loan exposures which exceed million in size  ranging from million to million 
the largest is a residential development project in meridian  idaho which is secured by five single family homes and eight single family lots 
the second is a land development project  also in meridian  idaho which is secured by undeveloped land 
the third is a land development project in mt 
vernon  washington which is secured by developed  residential use land 
at december   we had million of real estate owned and other repossessed assets  the most significant component of which was a parcel of undeveloped land in federal way  washington with a book value of  we were awarded the undeveloped land in as a result of litigation relative to certain previously charged off loans 
while this award resulted in an increase in real estate owned  since the loans had been fully charged off in prior periods  it also was recognized as a recovery in the quarter ended september  the remaining balance of our real estate owned consists of two single family residential homes  one located in boise  idaho and the other in bend  oregon 
management is optimistic about the prospects for disposal of these properties 
despite the significant increase in non performing loans and delinquencies in the most recent quarter  we are confident in the quality of our loan portfolio  as well as the state of the pacific northwest economy and are proactively managing our credit exposures 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our non performing assets and restructured loans within the meaning of sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructuring  at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table non performing assets at december nonaccrual loans loans secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction land commercial business agricultural business consumer total loans outstanding loans more than days delinquent  still on accrual loans secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction land commercial business agricultural business consumer total loans outstanding total non performing loans real estate repossessed assets held for sale total non performing assets restructured loans total non performing loans to net loans before allowance for loan losses total non performing loans to total assets total non performing assets to total assets for the year ended december   million in interest income would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been current  and no interest income on these loans was included in net income for this period 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of its cost the unpaid principal balance of the related loan plus foreclosure costs or net realizable value 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
at december   we had million of real estate owned  which consisted of one parcel of undeveloped land in western washington  a single family residential home located in bend  oregon and another single family home in boise  idaho 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  further  our operating results for the year ended december  include an million million net after tax gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value pursuant to the early adoption of fair value accounting under sfas no 
excluding the net fair value adjustments  net income from recurring operations was million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  there was no similar adjustment for fair value in  however  we did receive a million insurance settlement in excluding that settlement  net income from recurring operations was million  or per diluted share  in net income from recurring operations reflects continued growth of loans and deposits  including growth from acquisitions  as well as changes in the mix of those assets and liabilities 
our operating results also included substantial increases in other operating expenses  particularly compensation  occupancy  information services  payment and card processing  amortization of core deposit intangibles  and miscellaneous expenses  reflecting the recent acquisitions  growth in locations  operations and staff as we continue to expand 
we have added new branches through acquisition during the year ended december   and opened new branches and relocated eight others in the last three years 
in addition to the branches added through acquisition  new or relocated offices that contributed to the higher level of operating expenses during this year compared to the prior year include boise  meridian and nampa  idaho  baker city  beaverton  la grande  portland and tualatin  oregon  plus bellingham  oak harbor  redmond  federal way  east wenatchee  selah and college place  washington 
the current year s operating expense was also burdened with approximately  of one time costs associated with completing the conversion of the former f m bank branches onto the banner bank data processing platform 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the growth in average interest earning assets noted above and despite market pressures on the net interest margin as discussed below 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  declined nine basis points from the prior year  primarily as a result of the effect of higher deposit costs but also because of the negative effect of non accrual loans on asset yields 
subsequent to the federal reserve s decision to stop increasing short term interest rates after june and as a result of the lag effect on deposit pricing  increases in deposit costs generally exceeded increases in loan yields for the twelve months ended june  further  in the two most recent quarters  following the federal reserve s decision to lower interest rates  loan yields have declined more significantly than deposit costs 
mitigating in part the adverse effects of these market forces on loan and deposit pricing  our average asset mix for the year ended december  reflected proportionately more loans  and fewer investment securities than for the same period a year earlier 
at the same time  our average funding liability base had proportionately more deposits  including more non interest bearing deposits  and proportionately fewer borrowings than in the prior year 
reflecting generally higher market interest rates as well as these mix changes  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  increased by seven basis points compared to the prior year  while funding costs for year ended december  increased by basis points over the same period 
importantly  beginning in september  the federal reserve began aggressively lowering short term interest rates 
the initial effect of lower short term rates was to immediately reduce the yield on a significant portion of our loan portfolio  which  when combined with an increase in non accrual loans  was particularly damaging to our net interest margin in the fourth quarter of similar federal reserve policy actions have continued in the first quarter of as a result  we expect further compression of our net interest margin over at least the first two quarters of  despite the fact that we anticipate that funding costs will also significantly decline over that same time frame 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million one year earlier  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income occurred as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a seven basis point increase in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the yield on earning assets was achieved despite modestly lower loan yields as a result of significant growth in loans coupled with a reduction in lower yielding securities balances 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  interest income on loans for the year increased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the increase in average loan balances offset by a five basis point decrease in the average yield on loans 
the decrease in average loan yield reflects the lower average level of market interest rates late in the current year  following the federal reserve s recent actions designed to lower those rates  particularly in short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
while the recent level of market interest rates was lower than the same period a year earlier  loan yields did not change to the same degree as most fixed rate loans and certain adjustable rate loans did not adjust downward due to our use of interest rate floors  below which the loan will not adjust 
the decrease in average loan yields also reflects changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and slower turn over in the construction and development portfolio which resulted in less recognition of deferred loan fee income  as well as the adverse effect of increased loan delinquencies 
additional factors were changes in the average credit risk profile of new borrowers and competitive pricing pressure which resulted in lower spreads and yields on new loan originations 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock decreased by million for the year ended december   and  as a result  the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the year ended december  the lower average balance was offset to some degree as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents increased slightly to for the year ended december   from in the prior year 
while insignificant in amount  we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock in  an increase of  compared to the prior year as the fhlb of seattle received approval to resume paying its members cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of the fhlb of seattle ceased the payment of dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of to improve its capital position 
we anticipate that the yield on this asset will increase modestly in as the earnings and capital position of the fhlb of seattle have improved slightly 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable period in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense reflects a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  coupled with a basis point increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
the higher interest expense reflects a large increase in average deposits of million  partially offset by a million decrease in fhlb advances  junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings  as well as an overall lower cost of those non deposit funding sources 
the effect of modestly higher average market rates for the year on the cost of these funds was partially mitigated by pricing characteristics noted below and as deposits  including non interest bearing deposits  became a proportionately larger source of funds 
deposit interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  largely as a result of the significant deposit growth during the past twelve months including growth due to our acquisitions  as well as an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
reflecting the acquisitions  branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances increased basis points to 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits help mitigate the effect of higher market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing have been evident in the modest increase in deposit costs as the federal reserve moved to increase short term interest rates by basis points from september to june  and more recently as it decreased short term rates by basis points from september  to december  nonetheless  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits has been quite intense in recent quarters  as many financial institutions until very recently experienced strong loan growth and related funding needs 
however  in recent weeks  following the federal reserve s even more aggressive actions to lower short term interest rates  deposit market pricing has moderated and  as a result  we expect that the cost of deposits will decline over the near term 
average fhlb advances decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the prior year  resulting in a million decrease in the related interest expense 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances for the year ended december  decreased to  a decrease of basis points compared to one year earlier  as we benefited from repaying certain higher cost advances 
junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had an average balance of million with a higher average rate of 
generally  the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current year reflects a lower spread on the most recently issued debentures and the early redemption of a higher costing tranche of debentures  which was partially offset by the effect of increases in short term market interest rates on earlier issues over the first nine months of the year 
more recently  these debentures have been repricing lower as short term rates have been declining 
effective april   we exercised the early redemption provision with respect to approximately million of the junior subordinated debentures which had a spread of to six month libor and an average cost of during the six months preceding redemption 
we replaced the redeemed debentures with a new million tranche of junior subordinated debentures issued on july  with an initial rate of and a repricing spread of to three month libor 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers and reverse repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities 
the average balance for other borrowings decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  while the related interest expense decreased  to million from million for the respective periods 
the average balance of customer retail repurchase agreements increased by million while the average balance of the wholesale borrowings from brokers decreased approximately million 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
other borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits and fhlb advances  which generally lag current market rates  although  similar to deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements have a lower degree of volatility than most market rates 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million from the year ended december  as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves as more fully explained below 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  reflects an increase in delinquencies and non performing loans  balanced against slower growth in the size of the loan portfolio  excluding the effects of the mergers  continuing changes in the loan mix and a modest level of net charge offs 
there were net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to  one year earlier  and non performing loans increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  generally  these non performing loans reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  although slower sales in certain housing markets are clearly a significant contributing factor and the greatest increase in delinquencies and non performing loans was centered in construction and land development lending 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million  including million added through the acquisitions  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses remained unchanged at for both december  and the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and values impaired loans consistent with the guidelines in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared 
although we use the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on our continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio  including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience and current economic conditions  as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
and had established million of loss allowances related to these loans 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by us at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding loans with specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant factors including the experience of other banking organizations that  in our judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
for the year ended december   we adjusted our loss factors in accordance with updated guidance from our regulators 
the adjusted factors resulted in somewhat lower general and specific reserves  however  in the current economic environment  management s judgment with respect to the appropriate level of loss provisioning and allowance resulted in a significantly greater amount of unallocated allowance than in prior periods 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the financial statements 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands table changes in allowance for loan losses years ended december balance  beginning of period allowances added through business combinations provision recoveries of loans previously charged off secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction and land commercial business agricultural business consumer loans charged off secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction and land commercial business agricultural business consumer net charge offs balance  end of period ratio of allowance to net loans before allowance for loan losses ratio of net loan charge offs to the average net book value of loans outstanding during the period ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans specific or allocated loss allowances loans secured by real estate commercial multifamily construction and land one to four family including consumer commercial agricultural business consumer unallocated general loss allowance n a n a n a n a n a total allowance for loan losses we establish specific loss allowances when individual loans are identified that present a possibility of loss ie  that full collectibility is not reasonably assured 
the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding fair value adjustments recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
 recurring other operating income increased to million compared to million in the prior year  largely as a result of increased deposit fees and service charges 
deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   largely influenced by the increase in deposit balances from our acquisitions  yet also reflecting internally generated growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services 
changes in certain pricing schedules and interchange fees also contributed to the increased fee income 
loan servicing fees increased to million for the current year  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of growth in the banks portfolios as well as in the amount of loans serviced for others 
although loan sales declined  gain on sale of loans increased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year as the average gain per sale improved from an abnormally low level in the earlier period 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year 
gain on sale of loans in the current year included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
by comparison  in the year ended december   gain on sale of loans included  of fees on million of brokered loans 
as noted above  other income also included a net gain of million for the change in valuation of financial instruments now carried at fair value pursuant to the early adoption of fair value accounting under sfas no 
this gain primarily resulted from changes in the value of the junior subordinated debentures that we have issued  caused by a significant change in the level of credit spreads demanded by buyers of that type of security as reflected in year end market prices for comparable issues 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  largely reflecting the growth resulting from our branch expansion strategy and the three acquisitions 
other operating expense from recurring operations  which excludes the insurance recovery  increased by from million for the year ended december   to million for the current year 
besides the acquisitions  the increase in expenses includes operating costs associated with the opening of twelve new branch offices over the two year period in boise  meridian and nampa  idaho  baker city  beaverton  la grande  portland and tualatin  oregon  and bellingham and oak harbor  washington and the relocation and upgrading of our branch offices in college place  redmond  federal way  east wenatchee and selah  washington 
primarily reflecting the additional branches and bank acquisitions  salary and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  and occupancy costs increased by million  or  compared to the same period a year earlier 
in addition  compensation was higher as a result of general wage and salary increases  as well as increased per employee costs associated with benefit programs and employer paid taxes 
further  direct expenses associated with payment and card processing services increased by million  as a result of growth in these fee generating activities 
we also continued our strong commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  which were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the current year s operating expenses also included million for amortization of the core deposit intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of f m  sjfhc and ncw and approximately  of one time costs associated with completing the conversion of the former f m bank branches onto the banner bank data processing platform 
other operating expenses from recurring operations including the conversion costs as a percentage of average assets increased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  reflecting the impact of the acquisitions  integration and conversion costs and continuing startup costs associated with branch growth 
our efficiency ratio  adjusted to exclude fair value adjustments and the insurance recovery  increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
we expect continued increases in the absolute level of operating expenses as a result of our expansion plans  however  the pace of increase should slow as we reduce the number of new branch openings beginning in further  we believe that this investment in our branch network will lead to a lower relative cost of funds and enhanced revenues over time which  combined with expected cost savings from the acquisitions  should result in an improved efficiency ratio and stronger operating results 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million in the prior year 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in both periods reflect the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments as well as certain tax exempt income 
the slightly lower effective tax rate in primarily reflects the fully tax deductible expense associated with the current year esop contribution  which is in contrast with the prior year when the tax deduction was limited to the cost basis in the shares released 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the prior year 
our improved operating results reflected significant growth of assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the mix of those assets and liabilities  including the effects of certain balance sheet restructuring transactions completed in the quarter ended december   which resulted in a significant expansion in our net interest margin as more fully explained below 
our earnings in were also positively affected by the collection of a million insurance settlement relating to a loss incurred in the net amount of the settlement  following costs  resulted in a million credit to other operating expense and contributed approximately million  or 
per share  to net income for the year ended december  our operating results also included substantial increases in other operating expenses  particularly compensation  occupancy  information services  advertising and miscellaneous expenses  reflecting the growth in locations  operations and staff as we continued to expand our franchise 
twelve new or relocated branches contributed to the higher level of operating expenses in compared to the prior year 
during  we opened two new branches in boise  idaho  and during we opened an additional boise branch  as well as new or relocated branches in twin falls  idaho  beaverton  oregon and mercer island  alderwood  east wenatchee  lynden  vancouver  pasco and walla walla  washington 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  largely as a result of the growth in average interest earning assets noted above and the net interest margin expansion as discussed in the remainder of this paragraph 
the net interest margin of in improved basis points from the prior year  reflecting the balance sheet restructuring and our success in attracting higher yielding loans and growing deposits 
while this improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflected changes in both the asset and liability mix  including those resulting from the balance sheet restructuring  the lagging effect of increasing market interest rates on deposit costs  as more fully explained below  also contributed to the improvement 
in particular  the average asset mix for the year ended december  reflected proportionately more loans  including more higher yielding commercial  construction and land development loans  and fewer investment securities than a year earlier 
at the same time  the average funding liability base had proportionately more deposits  and proportionately fewer borrowings than in the prior year 
reflecting higher market interest rates as well as these mix changes  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  increased by basis points  compared to a year earlier  while funding costs for the year increased by basis points over the same period 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income that occurred was a result of the basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets as well as significant growth in these assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to a year earlier 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion in the prior year 
interest income on loans for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the increase in average loan balances combined with a basis point increase in the average yield on loans 
the increase in average loan yield reflected the increases in the level of market interest rates during the year  particularly in short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
however  following the federal reserve s decision to stop increasing short term interest rates in june  the average yield on these types of loans generally stabilized in the second half of the year 
the increase in average loan yields also reflected changes in the mix of the loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
while the level of market interest rates was significantly higher than a year earlier  loan yields did not change to the same degree as previously originated fixed rate loans do not adjust upward to market rates 
in addition  competitive pricing pressure resulted in lower yields on new loan originations 
these factors were somewhat offset by changes in the loan mix  as growth was most significant in some of the higher yielding adjustable rate loan categories  particularly construction and land development loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock decreased by million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting the fourth quarter balance sheet restructuring transactions  and the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the average yield on our investment securities increased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  largely reflecting the sale of lower yielding securities and the effect of higher market rates on certain adjustable rate securities and interest bearing deposits 
we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock in the fourth quarter of  as the fhlb of seattle received approval to resume paying its members cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
the fhlb of seattle did not pay a dividend in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was the result of the growth in interest bearing liabilities combined with a basis point increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from in the prior year  reflecting the higher levels of market interest rates and the maturity of certain lower costing certificates of deposit and fixed rate borrowings 
deposit interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the significant deposit growth as well as an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
reflecting our branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the prior year  while the average rate paid on deposit balances increased basis points to 
although deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits help mitigate the effect of higher market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing were evident in the relatively modest increase in deposit costs as the federal reserve increased short term interest rates by basis points from june to june  including an increase of basis points from december  nonetheless  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits was quite intense  as many financial institutions experienced strong loan growth and related funding needs 
in addition  customers became more effective in managing their non interest bearing transaction account balances as demonstrated by deposit growth being concentrated in certificates of deposit 
average fhlb advances decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the prior year  reflecting the fourth quarter restructuring transactions and resulting in a million decrease in the related interest expense 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances increased to  just basis points higher than the prior year  as the effect of significantly higher market interest rates on the floating rate and short term portions of the advances was partially offset by the prepayment of million of higher fixed rate  fixed term advances in connection with the balance sheet restructuring transactions completed in the quarter ended december  junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had an average balance of million with a lower average rate of 
the junior subordinated debentures outstanding in were adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three to six months 
the increased cost of the junior subordinated debentures reflected recent increases in short term market interest rates 
other borrowings consisted of retail repurchase agreements with customers and reverse repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities 
the average balance for other borrowings increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year  while the related interest expense increased million  to million from million for reflecting growth in our customer cash management services  the average balance of customer retail repurchase agreements increased million while the average balance of the wholesale borrowings from brokers decreased million 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was in the year ended december   compared to in provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million for the prior year 
the provision in reflected a reduced amount of net charge offs  balanced against modestly higher levels of non performing loans  growth in the size of our loan portfolio and continuing changes in the loan mix 
there were net charge offs of  in  compared to million of charges for the prior year  and non performing loans increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  generally  these non performing loans reflected unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  housing or real estate markets  or depressed farm commodity prices or adverse growing conditions 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
and had established million of loss allowances related to these loans 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
however  in the fourth quarter of  as a part of our balance sheet restructuring initiatives  we recorded million of net loss on the sale of securities 
excluding the net loss on the sale of securities relating to the balance sheet restructuring transactions  total other operating income would have been million for the year ended december   resulting in a million increase in recurring other operating income for as compared to deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily reflecting growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services  although changes in certain pricing schedules also contributed to the increase 
loan servicing fees decreased by  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   when we received a higher amount of prepayment fees 
gain on sale of loans was relatively unchanged  increasing by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year as our mortgage banking activity maintained a similar pace despite modestly higher mortgage rates 
gain on sale of loans was adversely affected by continued competitive pressures in the mortgage market which tended to reduce the margin on sales compared to the prior year 
however  in addition to normal mortgage banking activity  gain on sale of loans was augmented modestly in the third quarter of by the sale of approximately million of one to four family loans that had previously been included in the held for portfolio portion of loans receivable 
this sale was initiated for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes  however  it generated a gain of  loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year 
gain on sale of loans in included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and were not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
the year ended december  also included a gain of  on the sale of the guaranteed portion of certain sba guaranteed loans  while no similar sales activity occurred in the previous year 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
our total operating expenses in were significantly reduced by a net million insurance recovery which occurred in the second quarter of  while previous year total operating expenses include million of fhlb prepayment penalties associated with our balance sheet restructuring in the fourth quarter of excluding the insurance recovery and prior year prepayment penalties  recurring operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase of largely resulted from our branch expansion strategy and increased loan origination activity 
the increase in expenses included operating costs associated with the opening of two new offices in and eight offices in that in each case contributed less than a full year s expense during the year in which they opened 
further  during the third quarter of  we increased staffing to support our small business administration sba lending activities and to more effectively market cash management services 
in addition  compensation was higher as a result of increased mortgage loan commissions and general wage and salary increases  as well as increased costs associated with employee benefit programs and employer paid taxes 
these increases were mitigated to a degree by an increase in the amount of capitalized loan origination costs  which reflected increases in both the cost to produce and the volume of new loan originations 
we had an increase of million in payment and card processing expenses  largely driven by increased customer accounts and a significant increase in merchant credit card activity  which also contributed to significantly higher fee revenues 
we also increased our commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  which were million in the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the prior year 
reflecting the insurance recovery and the prior year fhlb prepayment penalty  as well as significant growth in the average asset base  other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
our efficiency ratio also decreased to for the year ended december  from for  as a higher level of revenues more than offset the increased operating expenses 
excluding the effects of the insurance recovery and the balance sheet restructuring charges  the ratio of recurring operating expenses to average assets was nearly unchanged at for compared to for  while the efficiency ratio decreased to from  respectively  despite continuing start up costs associated with branch growth 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in both years reflect the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments 
the higher effective tax rate in was primarily a result of a decrease in the relative combined effect of the tax credits from cra investments and tax exempt income from interest on municipal securities and earnings on bank owned life insurance  compared to other taxable net revenue sources which increased substantially reflecting the growth in loans and deposits and the effects of the insurance recovery and prior year balance sheet restructuring

market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on a portion of our floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  as of december   we have very few floating rate loans with interest rates that were not at levels above their floors and therefore these loans should be responsive to modest decreases or increases in market rates should they occur 
further  in a declining interest rate environment  as loans with floors are repaid they generally are replaced with new loans which have lower interest rate floors 
an additional exception to the generalization has been the beneficial effect of lagging and somewhat inelastic pricing adjustments for interest rates on certain deposit products in the current rising market interest rate environment 
this beneficial effect is particularly relevant to the administered rates paid on certain checking  savings and money market accounts and contributed to our expanded net interest margin for the years ended december  and however  since the federal reserve ceased increasing market interest rates in june  this lag effect has contributed to the recent narrowing of the net interest spread in  as deposit costs continued to increase while asset yields stabilized  and again following the federal reserve s actions to lower market interest rates late in  as asset yields declined while the reduction in deposit costs lagged 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize market value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net market value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net market value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net equity value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net market value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

table interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months net market value table a interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months net market value assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities 
another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe interest rate increase 
tables and a  interest sensitivity gap  present our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown 
at december   total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded total interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap to total assets ratio of 
management is aware of the sources of interest rate risk and in its opinion actively monitors and manages it to the extent possible 
the interest rate risk indicators and interest sensitivity gaps as of december  and are within our internal policy guidelines and management considers that our current level of interest rate risk is reasonable

although regular savings  demand  now  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities 
if all of these accounts had been assumed to be short term  the one year cumulative gap of interest sensitive assets would have been million  or of total assets at december   and million  or  at december  interest bearing liabilities for this table exclude certain non interest bearing deposits that are included in the average balance calculations reflected in table  analysis of net interest spread 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million  million and million  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities  sales of loans  and deposit growth 
during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million and million  respectively  of loans 
net deposit growth was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with million of the current year growth coming from acquisitions 
fhlb advances decreased million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures  decreased million for the year ended december   increased million for the year ended december   and increased million for the year ended december  we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  to purchase securities  and to pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
in we also used approximately million to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and acquisition costs of our three acquisitions 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling billion  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling billion 
while reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances 
we maintain credit facilities with the fhlb seattle  which at december  provide for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million  and of islanders bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million 
advances under this credit facility totaled million  or of our assets at december we also have in place borrowing lines with certain correspondent banks which in aggregate total million  none of which was drawn upon as of december  at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including billion which were scheduled to mature within one year 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
management believes it has adequate resources and funding potential to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements

the capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require banner corporation and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital 
the federal reserve requires banner corporation to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the fdic requirements 
the fdic requires the banks to maintain minimum ratios of tier total capital to risk weighted assets as well as tier leverage capital to average assets

the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
