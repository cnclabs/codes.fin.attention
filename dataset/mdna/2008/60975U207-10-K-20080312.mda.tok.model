the estimates and certain other statements below are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements and the adequacies of our available funds will depend on many factors  including those under risk factors 
overview we are a life sciences company committed to advancing personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes through the development of innovative molecular diagnostic products that guide and target the most appropriate treatments 
through a comprehensive understanding of the genetics  biology and pathology of particular diseases  we have pioneered and are developing molecular diagnostics and laboratory services that are designed to enable physicians to better manage infectious diseases and cancers by providing the critical information that helps them prescribe personalized treatments for patients by matching the underlying molecular features of an individual patient s disease to the drug expected to have maximal therapeutic benefit  and enable pharmaceutical companies to develop new and improved anti viral therapeutics and targeted cancer therapeutics more efficiently and cost effectively by providing enhanced patient selection and monitoring capabilities throughout the development process 
we are a leader in developing and commercializing innovative products that help guide and improve the treatment of infectious diseases  cancer and other serious diseases 
our goal with personalized medicine is to enable the management of diseases at the individual patient level through the use of sophisticated diagnostics that permit the targeting of therapeutics to those patients most likely to respond to or benefit from them  thereby offering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time 
monogram s phenosense and geneseq products provide a practical method for measuring the impact of genetic mutations on human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  drug resistance 
this information is used to optimize various treatment options for the individual patient 
we currently market phenotypic and genotypic resistance testing products directed at patients with hiv infection and the traditional drug classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and entry fusion inhibitors 
in addition  we have resistance tests in development or already used in research that are relevant to the new drug classes for which first in class drugs have been approved by the fda ccr antagonists and integrase inhibitors 
in addition to these resistance tests  in we initiated commercial sales of the trofile co receptor tropism assay 
trofile is a patient selection assay for the new class of ccr antagonists 
the first drug in this class  selzentry maraviroc from pfizer inc pfizer  was approved by the fda and by the european commission during upon approval of selzentry in the us  we introduced our trofile assay commercially and it is now available to help physicians select patients for clinical use of selzentry 
outside of the us  we are making trofile available through our global collaboration with pfizer 
the first product based on the veratag technology platform  the hermark breast cancer assay  is approved for routine testing in our clia certified clinical reference laboratory 
clinical studies to determine the assay s clinical utility are in progress 
over the last several years  we have built a business based on the personalized medicine approach in hiv drug resistance testing and in patient selection 
we now seek to leverage the experience and infrastructure we have built in the hiv market to the potentially larger market opportunity of cancer utilizing our proprietary veratag technology  in the future  we plan to seek opportunities to address an even broader range of serious diseases 
new targeted drug therapies are being introduced for the treatment of cancer 
our proprietary veratag technology provides an assay platform for analyzing very small amounts of tumor samples recovered and 
table of contents prepared in a variety of methods  including formalin fixation  the current standard technique in hospital pathology laboratories 
we believe this analytical platform may be well suited for the next generation of targeted cancer therapeutics 
we believe that  upon completion of development  our veratag assays will permit the prediction  with a high degree of accuracy  of the likelihood of a patient s cancer responding to a given therapy  facilitating the selection of more precise and effective therapeutic options 
we are developing epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr her  veratag assays that we believe will enable physicians to identify the appropriate course of treatment for cancers that have a particular molecular profile 
our current focus is on drugs that target the egfr her receptor family  initially in breast cancer but subsequently in lung and other cancers 
we intend to develop veratag assays that target other protein drug targets and signaling pathways that are key drivers of proliferation or survival in cancer cells 
we have incurred losses each year since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses at least for the next twelve months as we complete the development of the veratag technology  transfer the assays into the clinical laboratory  conduct clinical studies and develop the commercial infrastructure to support a commercial launch 
issuance of convertible senior unsecured notes in january  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior unsecured notes  due the notes 
although the notes are due in december  the notes may be called at the holder s option at december   december  or december   at a price equal to of the accreted value 
the aggregate purchase price for the notes was approximately million 
the notes do not bear interest and are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock  at an initial conversion price of per share  which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of the notes 
the conversion price will adjust automatically upon certain changes to our capitalization 
we have the option to cause all or any portion of the notes to automatically convert at such time as the closing price of our common stock is greater than for twenty out of thirty consecutive trading days  provided that certain conditions are met 
the notes are subordinated to all of our present senior debt  including the million senior secured convertible note  due may   issued to pfizer in may  as amended as described below  and our million line of credit with merrill lynch capital subsequently acquired by general electric  or ge 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  the company elected to initially and subsequently measure the notes as a hybrid debt instrument in its entirety with adjustments to the fair value reflected in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the valuation led to a million favorable convertible debt valuation adjustment to the carrying value of the notes  respectively  net of debt issuance costs to fair value 
this net adjustment is reflected as a non operating expense in the statement of operations 
as of december   the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the notes was million and million  respectively 
agreements with pfizer inc in may  we entered into a non exclusive collaboration agreement the collaboration agreement with pfizer to facilitate the global availability for patient use of our proprietary co receptor tropism assay  trofile trofile assay 
our trofile assay is used to identify which co receptor a patient s hiv uses for entry to cells and has been used in connection with phase iii clinical trials of pfizer s investigational ccr antagonist  selzentry maraviroc 
in august  selzentry was approved by the fda for use in ccr tropic treatment experienced patients 
the fda approved label for selzentry indicates that tropism testing should be used for patient selection and we expect that the trofile assay will be used to select patients for selzentry 
in october  selzentry was approved by the european commission 
under the collaboration agreement we 
table of contents have responsibility for making our trofile assay available in the us pfizer has responsibility for sales  marketing and regulatory matters outside of the us and will reimburse us for our expenses in establishing and maintaining the logistics infrastructure that may be necessary to make the assay available outside the us as required by pfizer 
the collaboration agreement covers the period through december   and is renewable by pfizer for five successive one year terms 
we and pfizer also extended the co receptor portion of our existing services agreement to support potential additional pfizer clinical trials through december  we also entered into a note purchase agreement with pfizer under which pfizer purchased a senior secured convertible note in the principal amount of million the pfizer note 
the pfizer note bears a annual interest rate  payable quarterly in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option  and matures in may  unless converted earlier 
the pfizer note is convertible at pfizer s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and will automatically convert into shares of our common stock should the closing price of our common stock be greater than  of the conversion price  or per share  for twenty out of thirty consecutive trading days 
in addition  the pfizer note is secured by certain assets related to our hiv testing business  is subject to certain covenants on our part and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness  subject to certain limited exceptions 
in connection with the sale of the notes  as described above  pfizer and us bank  national association  as trustee  and we entered into a subordination agreement in january  setting forth the terms under which the notes are subordinated to the pfizer note 
we also amended our note purchase agreement with pfizer  and amended and restated the pfizer note  to conform to certain terms of the subordination agreement 
as amended  the pfizer note provides that monogram will be in default if i an event of default occurs and is continuing under the notes and ii the trustee or any holders of the notes gives notice to us of its or their intent to either accelerate the notes or exercise any other remedies thereunder subject to certain limited exceptions 
as a result of the issuance of the notes  we were required to value and account for certain derivative instruments that are embedded in the pfizer note 
we elected to early adopt sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities to measure the pfizer note as a hybrid debt instrument in its entirety with adjustments to the fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
at the initial adoption of sfas  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the pfizer note of million  resulting in a fair value of million at january  for the year ended december   the valuation led to a million decrease to the carrying value of the pfizer note  which is reflected as a non operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december  and  the value of the pfizer note was million and million  respectively 
the unpaid principal balance of the pfizer note was million for both periods ended december  and in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting or as a single unit of accounting 
revenues are allocated to a delivered product or service when all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if all of the three required criteria under eitf are met  then the deliverables would be accounted for separately  completed as performed 
otherwise  the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when a performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
the pfizer collaboration is a multiple element arrangement  including supply of the trofile assay in additional clinical studies including expanded access programs in both the us and outside the us  supply of 
table of contents the trofile assay for use outside of the us  reimbursement of costs for the establishment and operation of supply infrastructure outside of the us and potential assistance to pfizer in the establishment and operation of a second facility for processing of tropism assays 
under the guidelines of eitf  we have determined that the collaboration with pfizer should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting due to the absence of established fair values of certain undelivered elements 
accordingly  we have deferred revenue under this collaboration until the earlier of establishment of fair values or completion of the deliverables 
additionally  related direct costs for the establishment and operation of supply infrastructure outside of the us that are contractually reimbursable on a non refundable basis under this collaboration have been deferred 
as of december  and  we had million and million of deferred revenue and million and million of deferred costs  respectively  under the collaboration agreement  within the us and internationally 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements accounting for stock based compensation on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r under provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using the modified prospective approach  and therefore  has not restated results for prior periods 
under this approach  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company records stock based compensation as a charge to income  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  the company recognized stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
the company has no awards with market or performance conditions 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and 
table of contents made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the statement of operations because the exercise price of the stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with sfas r  we used the black scholes option pricing valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value for stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock over the expected term of the awards  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv actual and projected employee exercise behaviors referred to as the expected term 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities from our stock for the expected term in effect on the date of grant with considerations to similar public entities in similar markets 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury yield for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived from actual historical exercise data with considerations to the contractual and vesting terms 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plans is equal to the offering period 
in addition  sfas r requires us to estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate will be recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from our estimates or factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates  as considered necessary 
in addition  we accounted for stock option grants to non employees in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the options subject to vesting to be periodically re valued over their service periods  which approximates the vesting period 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized upon completion of tests made on samples provided by customers and the shipment of test results to those customers 
services are provided to certain patients covered by various third party payer programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payer programs are included in revenue  net of allowances  for differences between the amounts billed and estimated receipts under such programs 
we estimate these allowances based on historical payment information and current sales data 
if the government and other third party payers significantly change their reimbursement policies  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary 
revenue generated from our database of resistance test results is recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements  generally upon shipment of the requested reports 
contract revenue consists of revenue generated from nih grants  commercial assay development and other non product revenue 
nih grant revenue is recorded on a reimbursement basis as grant costs are incurred 
the costs associated with contract revenue are included in research and development expenses 
for commercial and research collaborations  we recognize non refundable milestone payments received related to substantive at risk milestones when performance of the milestone under the terms of the collaboration is achieved and there are no further performance obligations 
research and development fees from commercial collaboration agreements are generally recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the collaboration agreement or as the research work is performed 
up front payments received in advance of meeting the revenue recognition criteria described above are deferred 

table of contents license revenue consists of up front license fees when the earnings process is complete and no further obligations exist 
if further obligations exist  the up front license fee is recognized ratably over the obligation period 
royalties received are recorded as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting or as a single unit of accounting 
revenues are allocated to a delivered product or service when all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if all of the three required criteria under eitf are met  then the deliverables would be accounted for separately  completed as performed 
otherwise  the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  other accrued expenses and short term obligations approximate fair value based on the highly liquid  short term nature of these instruments 
we also have long term instruments consisting of debt obligations in the form of convertible promissory notes  which are subject to interest rate and market risk due to the convertible features of those notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
we value debt obligations in accordance with the guidelines set forth in sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments and sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities using the framework established by sfas  fair value measurements for measuring fair value 
accounts receivable the process for estimating the collectibility of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
billings for services under third party payer programs are recorded as revenue net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated receipts  based on final settlement with the third party payers  are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenue 
in addition  we review and estimate the collectibility of our receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we assess the current state of our billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on our reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
we believe that the collectibility of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes  most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide 
as such  we have implemented procedures to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information 
changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our collection and reserves processes  along with our close monitoring of our billing processes  helps to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
we write off accounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible 

table of contents goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our merger with aclara  in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  we are required to test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets include acquired developed product technology  costs of patents and patent applications related to products and products in development  which are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition or loss of key personnel 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to our lack of earnings history  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
contingent value rights as part of the merger with aclara biosciences  inc aclara  we issued contingent value rights cvr to aclara stockholders and were obligated to issue cvrs to holders of assumed aclara stock options upon future exercise of those options 
in june  the amount payable related to the outstanding cvrs was determined at per cvr and a cash payment of approximately million was made to cvr holders on june  holders of assumed aclara options are entitled to receive a cash payment of  upon future exercise of those options  for each cvr that would have been issuable to them had the option been exercised prior to the cvr maturity date 
the liability under the cvrs was recorded at the closing of the merger with aclara at fair value  estimated using a calculation based on a black scholes valuation of the underlying cvr securities of per cvr 
subsequent to the closing of the merger  an active trading market had been established and as a result  this liability was revalued based on the actual closing price of the cvrs on the otc bulletin board at the end of each quarter 
in addition  we record an additional liability each quarter for additional cvrs related to assumed aclara stock options as they vest during each quarter 
results of operations year ended december  compared to years ended december  and in thousands product revenue contract revenue license revenue total revenue revenue 
revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
product revenue consists of revenue from our hiv testing services 
the million decrease in product in revenue in as compared to  and the million increase in product revenue in as compared to  was due primarily to the substantial completion  in  of pfizer s phase iii clinical trial of selzentry  the first drug in a new class of hiv drugs called ccr antagonists 
the use of our testing services  including our 
table of contents trofile co receptor tropism assay in pfizer s phase iii clinical trial of selzentry  generated significant revenue in the second half of and first half of the decreased revenue of the phase iii clinical trial of selzentry  was partially offset by revenue generated from the commercialization of our trofile assay during  excluding trofile assay revenue earned under the collaboration agreement with pfizer  which is deferred 
in august  selzentry was approved by the fda for use in ccr tropic treatment experienced patients 
the fda approved label for selzentry indicates that tropism testing should be used for patient selection and we expect that the trofile assay will be used to select patients for selzentry 
medicare is already providing coverage and reimbursement for the assay 
however  if our test is not used to select patients for selzentry  this could have a significant negative impact on our potential future revenues 
contract revenue consists of revenues from veratag and oncology collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as national institutes of health  or nih  research grants and other non product and non license revenue 
in  these sources of revenue decreased by million compared to and decreased million as compared to  as we focused our oncology development efforts on enhancing the operational reproducibility and sensitivity of the veratag assays and studies designed to clinically validate the hermark assay  a veratag test for applications in oncology 
we intend to make hermark  our first oncology test  available to patients upon completion of clinical studies designed to establish clinical utility of hermark in breast cancer 
hermark is approved for routine testing in our clia certified clinical reference laboratory 
we have an active program of applying for nih funding and currently have a number of active grants that we believe will help support the development of analytical and database tools to facilitate the identification and characterization of drug resistant strains of hiv  and assays that will aid in the pre clinical and clinical evaluation of the next generation of anti viral therapeutics 
license revenue consists primarily of revenue from license agreements for the microfluidics patent portfolio acquired in our merger with aclara in under the license agreements  we receive payments from ongoing royalties related to product and service revenues that encompass the use of our patents  and royalty sharing for any sublicense revenue 
we recorded million for the year ended december   primarily from a non recurring  upfront royalty for one particular license 
license revenues are likely to be lower in and beyond 
we anticipate quarterly variations in revenue due primarily to fluctuations in the timing of various planned and ongoing clinical studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies 
we have significant customer concentration and the loss of any major customer or the reduced use of our products by a major customer could have a significant negative impact on our revenue 
in  and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from tests performed for the beneficiaries of the medicare and medicaid programs 
additionally  in  and  quest diagnostics incorporated represented approximately for each year  laboratory corporation of america represented approximately  and  pfizer inc represented approximately  and  and glaxosmithkline represented approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in these costs are materials  supplies  labor and overhead related to product revenue 
product revenue gross margins were in  in and in the decrease in gross margin percentage in  as compared to and in as compared to  was due to the benefit of higher volumes provided by the use of our trofile assay in pfizer s phase iii trial of maraviroc during and the first half of gross margin was higher than the yearly average in the fourth quarter of  due to commercial introduction of trofile and the related increase in revenue 
we anticipate that gross margin on product revenue may increase as trofile revenue increases  and also after the potential future introduction of oncology products  which we believe may have a higher gross margin than our hiv products 
research and development 
research and development costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  research and development expenses were 
table of contents approximately the same as compared to and  respectively 
in  a net increase relating to stock based compensation expense of million was offset by lower materials and supplies costs in our oncology programs and reduced facilities expenses as a result of vacating the office and laboratory space in mountain view  california  in the second quarter of the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
completion dates and research and development expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
our products in development for hiv and other infectious diseases  target viral diseases and reflect a number of approaches to assessing resistance in individual patients to particular drugs 
our product lines overlap and most of our research and development activities in infectious disease are advancing multiple potential product lines 
due to this substantial overlap  we do not track costs on a project by project basis  except for the costs related to contract revenue 
a portion of our infectious disease research and development expenses are funded by grants and development contracts 
the following table sets our costs included in research and development expenses that are associated with such revenues research and development expenses funded by grants and development contracts 
year ended december  in thousands nih grants hiv assays hiv database hcv assay commercial assay development and other projects total below is a summary of our products in development for hiv and other infectious diseases 
infectious disease products in development status replication capacity hiv  a measurement of fitness in development phenosense hiv entry  entry inhibitor assay in development geneseq hiv entry  entry inhibitor assay in development phenosense and geneseq hiv integrase  integrase inhibitor assays in development phenosense hiv antibody neutralization  a vaccine development and evaluation assay in development phenosense and geneseq hiv assembly maturation  virus assembly or maturation inhibitor assays in development phenosense hcv  a phenotypic hepatitis c inhibitor assay in development geneseq hcv  a genotypic hepatitis c inhibitor assay in development the replication capacity hiv assay is validated in our clinical laboratory and the data is currently reported on our phenosense hiv and phenosense gt tests to both pharmaceutical company customers and for patient testing 
clinical development work continues 
the phenosense hiv entry assay has been validated in our clinical laboratory for the subclass of entry inhibitors that block host cell virus membrane fusion  such as enfuvirtide fuzeon  and is available to pharmaceutical company customers and for patient testing 
the assay is also available to pharmaceutical company customers to evaluate subclasses of entry inhibitors in development or recently approved  such as receptor and co receptor antagonists eg maraviroc  vicriviroc but is not yet validated in the clinical laboratory for such use in patient testing 
the geneseq hiv entry assay is available to pharmaceutical company customers to evaluate subclasses of entry inhibitors in development or recently approved  such as receptor and co receptor antagonists eg maraviroc  vicriviroc but is not yet validated in the clinical laboratory for such use in patient testing 

table of contents the phenosense and geneseq hiv integrase assays are validated for research purposes and available to pharmaceutical company customers 
assays for the integrase class are being validated and are expected to be available for physician use as needed in the future 
the phenosense hiv antibody neutralization assay is validated for research purposes and available to pharmaceutical company customers 
with nih funding  additional development work related to the use of our assays in vaccine development is being conducted 
the phenosense and geneseq hiv assembly maturation inhibitor assays are in development 
additional development work may be conducted on these assays in the future 
the geneseq hcv nsb assay has been validated for research use and is available to pharmaceutical company customers 
the geneseq hcv ns and phenosense hcv assays are in development with partial funding from a pharmaceutical company customer 
a substantial portion of our research and development expenditures are directed at continuing the research and development of the veratag technology 
our veratag technology has the potential  through detection of unique protein based biomarkers  to differentiate likely responders from non responders to certain targeted therapies in certain patient groups 
assays based on this technology have the potential to be used as aides for patient selection in pharmaceutical companies clinical trials of therapeutic products targeted on specific patient populations and as diagnostic services and or kits to guide physicians in the selection of appropriate therapies for particular patients 
the first veratag assay  the hermark breast cancer assay  is approved for routine testing in our clia certified clinical reference laboratory and clinical studies are ongoing to establish clinical utility of hermark for differentiating breast cancer patients who are likely to respond to herceptin  a targeted cancer therapy 
additional assays based on the veratag technology are in development 
hermark is designed to provide quantitative measurements of the presence of her protein and her homodimer 
additional assays providing measurements of her and her proteins and heterodimers such as her her and her her are in development 
these additional assays may have clinical utility both in breast cancer and in other cancer types  such as lung cancer and colorectal cancer 
the development of these assays  including their validation in our clia certified clinical reference laboratory  and the completion of studies to determine the clinical utility of both these assays and the hermark breast cancer assay are expected to be time consuming and could exceed one year 
as with our infectious disease programs  many of our oncology research and development programs support multiple product areas 
in particular  there is substantial overlap between our research and development activities in support of protein expression assays and protein based clinical assays for clinical collaborations and patient testing 
because of this overlap we do not identify and track costs incurred on a project by project basis 
the completion of our research and development projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including unplanned delays or expenditures during our product development  the extent of clinical testing required for regulatory approvals  the timing and results of clinical trials  failure to validate our technology and products in clinical trials and failure to receive any necessary regulatory approvals 
because of these uncertainties  the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete our research and development projects cannot be determined or estimated with any degree of certainty 
any delays or additional research and development efforts may also require us to obtain additional sources of funding to complete development of our products 
our failure to complete development of our products would have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase revenue and on our financial position and liquidity 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively

stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized under sfas r and cvr charges related to options that vested in the year was million in  as compared to million in there was no stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in however  in connection with our merger with aclara  we recorded adjustments from stock based compensation related to variable accounting for assumed aclara stock options  deferred compensation amortization and cvr expenses related to vested options during those periods

convertible debt valuation adjustments and interest income  net 
convertible debt valuation adjustments were million for the year ended december  in january  we issued million principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
pursuant to the guidelines set forth in sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  we elected to initially and subsequently measure the notes as a hybrid debt instrument in its entirety with adjustments to the fair 
table of contents value reflected in the statement of operations 
as a result of the issuance of the notes  we were required to value and account for certain derivative instruments embedded in the pfizer note with adjustments to the fair value reflected in the statement of operations 
we elected to early adopt sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities to measure the pfizer note as a hybrid debt instrument in its entirety using the framework established by sfas for measuring fair value 
for the year ended december   this valuation led to a million decrease to the net carrying value of the pfizer note and a million decrease to the carrying value of the notes  net of debt issuance costs  marked to fair value 
such adjustments could be substantial in future quarters in certain circumstances  such as if the company s common stock price is higher or lower than at december  interest income  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in  as compared to  and the decrease in  as compared to  were primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash and investment balances 
contingent value rights revaluation 
our liability under the cvrs  issued to aclara stockholders as part of the purchase consideration in the merger with aclara  was recorded at the closing of our merger with aclara at fair value  estimated using a calculation based on a black scholes valuation of the underlying cvr securities of per cvr 
because subsequent to the closing of the merger  an active trading market had been established  this liability was revalued based on the actual closing price of the cvrs on the otc bulletin board at the end of each quarter 
in june  the amount payable related to the outstanding cvrs was determined at per cvr and a cash payment of approximately million was made to cvr holders on june  this revaluation led to a million increase to our liability and is reflected as a non operating expense in the statement of operations for the year ended preferred stock dividend 
we recorded a preferred stock dividend of million in the series a preferred stock  issued in  bore dividends payable twice a year in shares of common stock 
in june  all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted to common stock 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we elected to early adopt sfas  effective january   to measure the fair value of the pfizer note as a hybrid debt instrument  in its entirety  with adjustments to the fair value reflected as a non operating expense in the statement of operations 
the impact of adopting sfas  resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle of million 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   funds provided by our various revenue sources  borrowing under accounts receivable and equipment financing arrangements will be adequate to fund our operations at least for the next twelve months

in 
table of contents addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for current or future operating plans 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or may not be available at all 
we expect our operating and capital resources will be sufficient to meet future requirements for at least the next twelve months 
net cash used in operating activities was million in cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly due to various factors including trends in operating losses  changes in accounts receivable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue related to new arrangements with customers 
the average collection period of our accounts receivable  as measured in days sales outstanding  can vary and is dependent on various factors  including the type of revenue ie patient testing  pharmaceutical company testing or contract revenue  the payment terms related to that revenue  the complexities in third party payer arrangements  and whether the related revenue was recorded at the beginning or end of a period

we anticipate utilizing this space in may the lease expires in april 
table of contents in august  we entered into a loan agreement of million to finance our insurance premiums at an interest rate of per annum 
the loan was paid in full in january as a result of the merger with aclara  at december   we assumed the lease for a facility of approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space in mountain view  california 
on february   we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease prior to its scheduled expiry 
the termination of the lease was subject to a specified third party executing a new lease with the landlord on terms and conditions satisfactory to the landlord and the landlord has subsequently notified us that this occurred 
we have an obligation to pay the landlord specified amounts over the remainder of the former lease term  or through june as of december   the remaining obligation was million  which is included in the table below

at december   our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands purchase obligations operating lease obligations equipment financing arrangements convertible senior unsecured note senior secured convertible note convertible note interest payment loans payable total subject to certain limitations  we are entitled to make such interest payments using shares of our common stock 
the contractual obligations discussed above are fixed costs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet these contractual obligations  we may have to raise additional funds 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all

in the event of default by the assignee  the company would be contractually obligated for payments under the lease of million in  million in  million in and million in 
table of contents long term capital and liquidity considerations 
we expect that we will have to make substantial investments in operating and capital expenditures as we develop and commercialize new clinical testing products  expand the availability of our current testing products and lease additional facilities to replace expiring subleased facilities 
during  we made capital expenditures of approximately million 
while we do not currently have any additional material commitments for future capital expenditures  we expect to incur capital expenditures for our existing facilities and capital expenditures related to the leased space that we expect to occupy in may in the future  we may incur additional capital expenditures as we expand our clinical laboratory to accommodate commercial availability of veratag assays for oncology  expand our commercial infrastructure in anticipation of the introduction of oncology products  potentially establish an fda compliant manufacturing facility and make our hiv and oncology assays available globally in support of drugs for which our tests may be important diagnostics 
at december   we held a building lease of approximately  square feet and subleased several building spaces of approximately  and  square feet  respectively  in south san francisco  california 
in  we executed a lease of an approximately  square foot facility to accommodate administrative and laboratory personnel in anticipation of potential growth and expansion of our business and to replace the short term lease of the  square feet of subleased office space  which expires in august from time to time  we may consider possible strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  with the goal of growing our business and maximizing stockholder value 
such transactions  if any  could materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources 
we may need to obtain additional funding by entering into new collaborations and strategic partnerships to enable us to develop and commercialize our products 
even if we receive funding from future collaborations and strategic partnerships  we may need to raise additional capital in the public equity markets  through private equity financing or through debt financing 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve additional restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed  may harm our business and operating results 
income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates between the years and  if not utilized 
the state of california net operating losses will expire at various dates between the years and  if not utilized 
the federal and state operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
utilization of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
when utilized  the portion related to stock options deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt obligations primarily in the form of convertible notes and our investment portfolio 
our debt obligations are subject to interest rate and market risk due to the convertible features of our notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
our investment portfolio may consist of fixed rate securities  which may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principle if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held at december   that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps 
fair values represent the market principal at december  in thousands 
given an interest rate decrease of x basis points given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer bps bps bps bps bps bps bps money market commercial paper the weighted average maturity of our marketable investments at december   was days 
we have exposure to cash  money market and commercial paper credit risks  which may adversely impact our cash and commercial paper fair value 
as of december   there was no credit risk impact to the valuation of our cash  money market and commercial paper investments 
we also have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit line with ge  which bears interest at a rate per annum equal to a published libor rate plus 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the revolving credit line and the libor rate was 
we do not utilize derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
we operate primarily in the united states and all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
