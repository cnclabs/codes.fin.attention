item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the realization of which may be impacted by certain important factors including  but not limited to  those risk factors disclosed pursuant to item a 
introduction and overview powerwave is a global supplier of end to end wireless solutions for wireless communications networks 
our business consists of the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of products to improve coverage  capacity and data speed in wireless communication networks  including antennas  boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions 
these products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support voice and data communications by use of cell phones and other wireless communication devices 
we sell such products to both original equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products into their proprietary base stations which they then sell to wireless network operators  and directly to individual wireless network operators for deployment into their existing networks 
on october   we completed the acquisition of the wireless infrastructure division business of filtronic plc 
during the last seven years  demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
while demand for wireless infrastructure was strong during  it weakened for powerwave during and due to significant reductions at three major customers  as well as a general slowdown in overall demand within the wireless infrastructure industry 
in the past there have been significant slowdowns in capital spending by wireless network operators due to delays in the expected deployment of infrastructure equipment and financial difficulties on the part of the wireless network operators who were forced to consolidate and reduce spending to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their profitability 
economic conditions  such as the potential united states recession forecasted for fiscal  have also had a negative impact on capital spending by wireless network operators  and may have a negative impact going forward 
these changes have a significant negative impact on overall demand for wireless infrastructure products  and at various times  have directly reduced demand for our products and increased price competition within our industry which has in the past led to reductions in our revenues and contributed to our reported operating losses 
during fiscal and  we experienced a significant slowdown in demand from one of our direct network operator customers  at t  as well as reduced demand from several of our original equipment manufacturing customers  including nokia siemens and nortel networks  all of which combined directly reduced demand for our products and contributed to our operating losses for both fiscal and for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment in the value of our goodwill in the amount of million 
this significantly increased our loss for fiscal year we believe that we have maintained our overall market share within the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market during this period 
we continue to invest in the research and development of wireless communications network technology and the diversification of our product offerings  and we believe that we have one of our industry s leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our proprietary design technology is a further differentiator for our products 
looking back over the last several years  beginning in fiscal we focused on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of lgp allgon 
this acquisition involved the integration of two companies based in different countries that previously operated independently  which was a complex  costly and time consuming process 
we have implemented our plans to restructure and integrate lgp allgon s operations  technology and personnel with ours 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of remec  inc s wireless systems business the remec wireless acquisition 
we believe that this acquisition further strengthened our position in the global wireless infrastructure market 
we have implemented our plans to restructure and integrate the acquired remec operations  technology and personnel with our operations 
in october  we completed the filtronic wireless acquisition 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provided us with the leading position in transmit and receive filter products  as well as broadening our rf conditioning and base station solutions product portfolio and added significant additional technology to our intellectual property portfolio 
for fiscal year  we were focused on finalizing and implementing our plans to integrate this acquisition  consolidate its operations and reduce our overall cost structure 
during this same time  we encountered a significant unanticipated reduction in revenues  which caused us to revise our integration and consolidation plans with a goal of further reducing our operating costs and significantly lowering our breakeven operating structure 
as we ended  we have a number of ongoing restructuring activities which are aimed at further reducing our overall operating cost structure and position us to return to profitability 
as was demonstrated during  these acquisitions do not provide any guarantee that our revenues will increase 
we measure our success by monitoring our net sales by product and consolidated gross margins  with a short term goal of maintaining a positive operating cash flow while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
we believe that there continues to be long term growth opportunities within the wireless communications infrastructure marketplace  and we are focused on positioning powerwave to benefit from these long term opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the critical accounting policies that we believe are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived from the sales of products 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or delivery and passage of title depending upon the terms of the sale 
we offer certain of our customers the right to return products within a limited time after delivery under specified circumstances  generally related to product defects 
we monitor and track such product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are highly concentrated in a small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compares those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
depending on the product line  provisions are established based on historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these provisions reduce the cost basis of the respective inventory and are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past seven fiscal years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventory is sold 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial accounting and tax reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of our cumulative federal and state net operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of our gross deferred tax assets 
for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  current and future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
acquired tax liabilities related to prior tax returns of acquired entities at the date of purchase are recognized based on our estimate of the ultimate settlement that may be accepted by the tax authorities 
we continually evaluate these tax related matters 
at the date of any material change in our estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liabilities previously recognized are adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 
in july  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fin as of january   and have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns for all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the periods subject to examination for our us federal return are the through tax years  including adjustments to net operating loss and credit carryovers to those years 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitation generally ranging from to years 
as of the adoption date  a liability for uncertain income tax positions has been recorded pursuant to fin in the amount of million in taxes including accrued penalties and interest of million 
of this amount  million would affect tax expense if the uncertain tax benefits were recognized  million would result in a decrease of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where they are currently offset by a full valuation allowance  and million would impact goodwill 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price over fair value recorded as goodwill 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development  we typically engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and expected costs to complete development projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the successful completion of development projects  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to the accounting value of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize subjective valuations for the reporting unit based upon a discounted cash flow analysis as well as quoted market prices of our common stock plus an estimated market premium based upon companies with similar market transactions 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of various factors including estimates of forecasted revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
if the forecast assumptions utilized materially change  it could result in a lower fair value calculation which could require an impairment of existing goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the underlying net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is less than the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all its underlying identifiable assets and liabilities 
in the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill 
see further discussion of this charge in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchased intangible assets with determinable useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which generally range up to six years 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets  including fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
the actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from our estimates due to increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value of an asset is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
while we do not believe that any of our intangible or other long lived assets are currently impaired  there have been impairments in the current year as well as in the past  and any future impairment of such assets could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for standard warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of the sale and update such estimate throughout the warranty period 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
we also have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to our products outside of our standard warranty period if such defect were to occur 
any costs related to epidemic defects are generally recorded at the time the epidemic defect becomes known to us and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
while we have experienced occasional significant costs due to epidemic defects  we have not historically regularly experienced significant costs related to epidemic defects 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience significant costs to repair epidemic defects in the future 
a significant increase in product return rates  a significant increase in the costs to repair our products  or an unexpected epidemic defect in our products  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results during the period in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
accruals for restructuring and impairment charges we recorded million  million and million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal years  and  respectively  which includes an impairment charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill 
see further discussions of these charges under operating expenses below and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring plan in the second quarter of  we formulated and began to implement a plan to further consolidate operations and reduce operating costs 
as part of this plan  we closed our design and development centers in el dorado hills  california and toronto  canada  and discontinued our design and development center in shipley  uk 
we finalized this plan in the fourth quarter of a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended december  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at december  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in sfas no

all of the workforce reduction payments were completed in the fourth quarter of and the facility closure amounts will be paid out over the remaining lease terms which extend through the third quarter of plan for consolidation of operations in the fourth quarter of  and in connection with the filtronic wireless acquisition  we formulated and began to implement a plan to restructure our global manufacturing operations with an initial primary focus on operations in china 
as part of this plan to reduce our costs  we are consolidating our manufacturing facilities in wuxi and shanghai  china  into the manufacturing facility located in suzhou  china  acquired in the filtronic wireless acquisition 
the plan was finalized in the second quarter of and includes reduction of workforce  impairment and disposal of inventory and equipment utilized in discontinued product lines  and facility closure costs 
in addition  we will also cease production of certain product lines manufactured in the two plants that are closing in china  as well as products manufactured in costa rica and produced at a contract manufacturer in china due to efforts to reduce costs and to eliminate duplicative product lines 
the costa rica manufacturing facility was closed in december a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the plan for consolidation of operations at december   and december  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at january  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at december  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in sfas no

integration of lgp allgon and remec s wireless systems business we recorded liabilities in connection with the acquisitions for estimated restructuring and integration costs related to the consolidation of remec s wireless systems business and lgp allgon operations  including severance and future lease obligations on excess facilities 
these estimated costs were included in the allocation of the purchase consideration and resulted in additional goodwill pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination or 
the implementation of the restructuring and integration plan is substantially complete 
a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the integration of the remec wireless business and lgp allgon for fiscal years ended december   and december  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs other total balance at january  amounts assumed from remec amounts accrued in purchase accounting amounts expensed amounts paid incurred effect of exchange rates balance at january  amounts accrued in purchase accounting amounts paid incurred effect of exchange rates balance at december  excess reserves offset to goodwill amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effect of exchange rates balance at december  all workforce reduction payments have been made  and we expect that the facility closure amounts will be paid out over the remaining lease terms which extend through january all of these restructuring and impairment accruals related primarily to workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities  and the discontinuation of certain product lines  including the associated write downs of inventory  manufacturing and test equipment  and certain intangible assets 
such accruals were based on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters which were uncertain at the time  including the timing and amount of sublease income that will be recovered on vacated property and the net realizable value of used equipment that is no longer needed in our continuing operations 
while we used our best current estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time to quantify these charges  different estimates could reasonably be used in the relevant periods to arrive at different accruals and or the actual amounts incurred or recovered may be substantially different from the assumptions utilized  either of which could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations for a given period 
as a result  we periodically review the estimates and assumptions used and reflect the effects of those revisions in the period that they become known

results of operations the following table summarizes powerwave s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   december   and january  fiscal years ended december  december  january  net sales cost of sales cost of goods intangible asset amortization acquired inventory incremental costs restructuring and impairment charges total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative intangible asset amortization in process research and development restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charge total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income taxes income loss from discontinued operations loss on sale of subsidiary total discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss years ended december  and december  net sales our sales are derived from the sale of wireless communications network products and coverage solutions  including antennas  boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions for use in cellular  pcs  g  and wimax wireless communications networks throughout the world 
sales increased by to million  for the year ended december   from million  for the year ended december  this increase was due to several factors  which included significantly higher demand from our original equipment manufacturer customers  which increased by million or from fiscal year to the major contributors to this increase were alcatel lucent  which increased by million  and nokia siemens  which increased by million 
these increases were offset by a reduction in our direct operator sales channel  which decreased by million or from to these numbers reflect a full year of net sales from the acquisition of filtronic in for  we experienced further weakness in both the european and north american direct operator channels 
we believe that this reduction was due to several issues  including the low spending level by at t during the first half of  and delays in the deployment of t mobile s north american g network during in addition  european network operators reduced spending on their g networks during the following table presents a further analysis of our sales based upon our various product groups fiscal years ended in thousands wireless communications product groups december  december  antenna systems base station subsystems coverage solutions total net sales antenna systems consist of base station antennas and tower mounted amplifiers 
base station subsystems consist of products that are installed into or around the base station of wireless networks and include products such as boosters  combiners  filters  outdoor cabinets and radio frequency power amplifiers 
coverage solutions consist primarily of repeaters and advanced coverage solutions 
the decrease in the antenna systems product group sales during as compared to is due primarily to the reduction in direct operator sales during the majority of products sold in this product revenue group are sold directly to wireless network operators  so any overall slowdown in this customer group impacts this product revenue group 
the reduction in the coverage solutions product group sales during was due to lower repeater and coverage engineering sales compared to  as well as the sale of the microwave product line during microwave products accounted for approximately million of revenues during and no revenues during offsetting these two product groups was the increase in the base station subsystems product group sales  which were largely driven by higher original equipment manufacturer sales during compared to we track the geographic location of our sales based upon the location of our customers to which our products are shipped 
since many of our customers purchase products from us at central locations and then reship the product with other base station equipment to locations throughout the world  we are unable to identify the final installation location of our products 
the following table presents an analysis of our net sales based upon the geographic area to which a product was shipped fiscal years ended in thousands geographic area december  december  americas asia europe other international total net sales revenues in the americas increased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased delivery of original equipment manufacturer products in the north american marketplace 
revenues in the asia region increased by during fiscal  primarily due to increased sales into china  india  and south korea 
in addition  several of our original equipment manufacturer customers started taking delivery of products within the asia region  when previously they had taken delivery of certain products outside of the region  particularly in europe 
revenues in the european region declined by during  due to several of our original equipment manufacturer customers taking product deliveries in a region outside of europe if the product is being sold outside of europe 
in addition  weakness in the european direct operator market contributed to the overall decline in revenues for europe 
since wireless network infrastructure spending is dependent on individual network coverage and capacity demands  we do not believe that our revenue fluctuations for any geographic region are necessarily indicative of a predictable trend for our future revenues by geographic area 
in addition  as noted above  growth in one geographic location may not reflect actual demand growth in that location due to the centralized buying processes of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
for the year ended december   total sales to nokia siemens accounted for approximately of sales and sales to alcatel lucent accounted for approximately for the period 
for the year ended december   total sales to nokia and siemens accounted for approximately of sales and sales to alcatel and lucent accounted for approximately 
notwithstanding our prior acquisitions  our business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of customers within the wireless communications market and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in attracting new customers or retaining or increasing business with our existing customers 
a number of factors have caused delays and may cause future delays in new wireless infrastructure and upgrade deployment schedules throughout the world  including deployments in the united states  europe  asia  south america and other areas 
in addition  a number of factors may cause original equipment manufacturers to alter their outsourcing strategy concerning certain wireless communications network products  which could cause such original equipment manufacturers to reduce or eliminate their demand for external supplies of such products or shift their demand to alternative suppliers or internal suppliers 
such factors include lower perceived internal manufacturing costs and competitive reasons to remain vertically integrated 
due to the possible uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and original equipment manufacturer demand  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand from our original equipment manufacturer and network operator customers 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in our revenues and or operating results  which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of sales and gross profit our cost of sales includes both fixed and variable cost components and consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs  warranty costs and amortization of product related intangibles 
components of our fixed cost structure include test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
in addition  as we have acquired additional businesses with additional manufacturing facilities  as demand and sales decrease  the amounts expensed to cost of sales increases due to the additional overhead costs that are not being absorbed 
conversely  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
the following table presents an analysis of our gross profit fiscal years ended in thousands december  december  net sales cost of sales cost of goods intangible asset amortization acquired inventory incremental costs restructuring and impairment charges total cost of sales gross profit our total gross profit decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our increased restructuring and impairment charges incurred in in addition  during our cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of our revenues due to increased charges for inventory obsolescence  compared to for  our total inventory excess and obsolete charges were million  compared to million for we also incurred a full year of the increased manufacturing overhead costs associated with the filtronic wireless acquisition  which was completed in october also contributing to the reduction in our gross profit percentage was a reduction in direct operator sales as a percentage of total sales  which typically have carried higher margins than our original equipment manufacturers based sales 
for  direct operator sales were approximately of our total revenues  compared to approximately of total revenues for for both and  we incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges 
for  these charges relate to several areas  including our completion of the china manufacturing consolidation  our manufacturing consolidation and restructuring activities  and the restructuring of our contract manufacturing relationships 
for  these charges are related to restructuring plans implemented in conjunction with the china manufacturing consolidation and certain acquisitions related restructuring plans see note restructuring and impairment charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements under part ii
