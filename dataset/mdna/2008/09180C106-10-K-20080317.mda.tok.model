item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of march   we owned and operated restaurants located in california  oregon  colorado  arizona  texas  nevada  ohio  florida  oklahoma and kentucky 
in addition  we have one licensed restaurant in lahaina  maui 
each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  or a bj s pizza grill restaurant 
our menu features our award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our own handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
the first bj s restaurant was opened in orange county  california in as a small full service restaurant focusing on chicago style deep dish pizza 
in  our current co chairmen assumed the operations of the restaurants and in purchased the restaurants from the original founders 
in  the company opened its first large format restaurant and brewery in brea  california and began to expand the menu to include appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
as of march   of the restaurants we operated  were bj s restaurant brewery restaurants of which seven were manufacturing beer for our restaurants  were bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurants which are similar to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture beer  and seven were bj s pizza grill restaurants which are primarily our original  smaller format legacy restaurants 
our future restaurant growth will focus principally on our bj s restaurant brewhouse format  however  we may continue to build additional bj s restaurant brewery locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer 
we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize the excess capacity of other highly qualified craft brewers to produce our handcrafted beers under our proprietary recipes and our indirect supervision 
we currently believe that  over the long run  it will become more beneficial to increase our contract brewing due to the economies of scale that can be obtained from brewing beer in large quantities while also minimizing legal complications in some states where we desire to operate restaurants 
as such  we expect to gradually increase our contract brewing relationships over the next several years 
as a result of this expected increase in contract brewing  we intend to rebalance our internal production and may decommission certain internally operated breweries  which may result in additional disposals of related assets in the future 
in  we purchased additional restaurants in oregon and washington from pietro s corp pietro s to expand our presence in the northwest 
the pietro s restaurants primarily served thin crust pizza in a very casual counter service environment 
over the following eight years we closed of the pietro s restaurants and converted three restaurants to bj s locations 
on march   we sold the remaining three pietro s restaurants to employees of those restaurants 
we intend to continue developing bj s restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants 
therefore  we expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth will come from new restaurant openings 
newly opened restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on restaurant opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and occupancy and operating expenses 
additionally  restaurants in new markets may experience higher costs overall due to higher supply chain costs or labor costs until additional restaurants can be opened in nearby locations resulting in lower costs due to the increased purchasing volume and brand awareness 

table of contents our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurants 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
effective june  we began recognizing gift card breakage as other income on our consolidated statements of income 
gift card breakage is recorded when the likelihood of the redemption of the gift cards becomes remote  which is typically months after original gift card issuance 
cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage supplies 
the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate with sales volumes 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees 
occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies  credit card fees  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
occupancy and operating expenses generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate  field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include corporate management  field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related employee benefits including stock based compensation expense  travel and relocation costs  information systems  the cost to recruit and train new restaurant management employees  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
restaurant opening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant  travel  the cost of food and supplies used in training  grand opening promotional costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant  including rent during the construction and in restaurant training period 
the company currently has leases for two of its larger format bj s restaurant and brewhouse locations that  unless renewed  will expire during the next months and one of its smaller  legacy bj s pizza and grill location that is currently operating on a month to month lease 
the company believes that all three leases can be renewed on satisfactory terms and is currently communicating with the respective landlords to determine the specific terms of the renewals in the event the company ultimately determines it is in its best interests to renew 
in addition  the company intends to close one of its smaller  legacy bj s pizza and grill location in the portland  oregon area upon the expiration of its lease in march during fiscal  this smaller format restaurant contributed sales of only million and operating income of less than  the company does not expect the costs associated with closing this restaurant to have a material impact on the company s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year consolidated statements of income data revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor and benefits occupancy and operating expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization restaurant opening expense loss on disposal of assets gain on sale of pietro s restaurants total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net total other income expense income before taxes income tax expense net income fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately million in restaurant sales from new restaurants not in our comparable sales base for the prior period  and an increase of approximately million or  from comparable restaurant sales 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted in part from an effective menu price increase of approximately with the remaining increase due to increased guest counts and menu mix shifts 
based on our best assessment of the potential impact of known commodity  labor and other operating cost increases as of march   we believe that another effective menu price increase will be necessary to protect our restaurant operating margins during fiscal however  there can be unknown cost pressures that unexpectedly arise and impact our results of operations 
if our guests do not accept our price increases  either by reducing their visits to our restaurants or by changing their purchasing patterns at our restaurants  the expected benefit of the menu price increase could be negated and our operating margins could be impacted 
during  our menu prices were increased at a slightly higher rate than in past years primarily to offset the impact of certain increased commodity costs  increased statutory minimum wages and the cost of certain quality enhancements introduced to our restaurants  including but not limited to a more intensive  ongoing repair and maintenance program and upgraded china  silverware  glassware and linen napkins 
our revenues and  in particular  our comparable sales benefited from these menu price increases 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other 
table of contents factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  shifts in the holiday calendar  competitive restaurant intrusions into our trade areas  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors  as described in the risk factors section in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for the year ended january   can impact comparable sales comparisons 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved as a result of increased menu prices or other factors 
the slowing us economy has negatively impacted overall consumer traffic to casual dining restaurants in general during fiscal  and  we expect that casual dining consumer traffic will continue to be negatively impacted in general during fiscal our comparable restaurants experienced a slight decline in guest traffic during the fourth quarter of fiscal and it is likely that such decrease in guest traffic will continue for at least the first quarter of fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this decrease is a result of higher menu prices and improved efficiencies at our reno brewery  partially offset by increased produce costs related to record cold weather in california in early and increased cheese and dairy related costs 
we do anticipate that cost of sales in our new restaurants will typically be higher during the first days of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes at our new restaurants 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and  therefore  we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
we believe the overall cost environment for food commodities in general will remain under significant pressure during  primarily due to domestic and worldwide agricultural  supply demand and other macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control 
see business supply chain management in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs 
however  there can be no assurance that future costs for supplies and commodities used in our restaurants will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this percentage increase is primarily due to minimum wage increases in california and certain other states  coupled with an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  or approximately of revenues related to restricted stock units granted in accordance with our gold standard stock ownership program as of the beginning of fiscal  partially offset by the leverage of the fixed nature of our workers compensation and payroll benefit plans resulting from our comparable restaurant sales 
the california minimum wage increased to per hour effective january  other state minimum wages will likely increase in additionally  the federal minimum wage will increase to per hour effective july  in the past  we have been able to react to changes in our key operating costs  including minimum wage increases  by gradually increasing our menu prices and improving our productivity in our restaurants 
however  we cannot guarantee that all or any future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our restaurants 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we implemented a performance based equity incentive plan  the bj s gold standard stock ownership program the gssop  for our restaurant general managers  executive kitchen managers and field supervision personnel 
the new equity incentive plan consists of awards of restricted stock units that require five year service and performance commitments  among other factors 
the non cash pre tax compensation expense associated with these awards was approximately  for fiscal this expense will increase during fiscal as we continue to open new restaurants and thereby increase the number of participants in the gssop 
occupancy and operating expenses 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the increase reflects additional operating and occupancy expenses related to the new restaurants we opened since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy and operating expenses increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to increased costs related to our upgraded china  silverware  glassware and linen napkins  gross receipts tax  license fees and increased merchant credit card fees passed through to us by our transaction processor partially offset by increased leverage of the fixed component of these expenses from higher revenues 
in response to the continuing challenges in the operating environment for casual dining restaurants in general and the slowing us economy  we will slightly increase the amount of our marketing expenses during fiscal see business marketing in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of included in general and administrative costs for the weeks ended january  and january  is million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement no 
r 
this increase is primarily due to planned investments in field supervision and corporate infrastructure to support our growth  higher travel and lodging costs related to our new restaurants in new states and higher restaurant management recruiting and training costs 
during  we expect to continue to add resources to the corporate support and field supervision activities in preparation for the planned openings of as many as restaurants  which would increase our operating week capacity by to in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to for the week period ended january  from for the prior year comparable week period 
this decrease is primarily due to leverage of the fixed component of theses expenses over a higher revenue base 
beginning in fiscal  we relocated our corporate office to a larger leased facility to support our future growth 
in connection with this relocation  we incurred approximately  of additional rent expense in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to increased construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating toolsets  restaurant remodels and initiatives 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase is primarily due to opening costs related to restaurant openings during the weeks ended january   compared to restaurant openings for the weeks ended january   coupled with higher travel and lodging costs related to openings in our new states and higher pre opening rent 
our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings

see business restaurant opening expenses in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets of million  or of revenues for the weeks ended january  is due to the implementation of our strategic and growth initiatives 
as a result of these initiatives  we made several strategic decisions to upgrade certain assets in our restaurants including the replacement of existing televisions with new flat panel  high definition televisions  the implementation of a more contemporary china silverware glassware program and the acceleration of depreciation for two restaurants that were remodeled during fiscal we also decommissioned four of our older  smaller and inefficient legacy breweries and shifted those brewing activities to our new  larger and more efficient reno brewery that began initial production activities in the fourth quarter of we currently believe that  over the long run  it will become more beneficial to increase our contract brewing due to the economies of scale that can be obtained from brewing beer in large quantities  as well as legal considerations in some states where we desire to open restaurants 
as such  we expect to gradually increase our contract brewing relationships over the next several years 
as a result of this expected increase in contract brewing we intend to rebalance our internal production and may decommission other internally operated breweries  which may result in additional disposals of related assets in the future 
additionally  we relocated our home office support activities to a larger leased facility to more effectively accommodate our planned future expansion which resulted in the disposal of certain nonproductive support related assets 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase is primarily due to higher investment balances  coupled with higher interest rates  compared to the same period last year 
other income  net 
net other income increased to  during comparable weeks ended january  from  during the comparable week period of  an increase of  this increase is primarily due to income recognized from gift card breakage  which we began to recognize in based on an analysis of our gift card program since its inception  we determined that months after issuance date  the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the comparable week period of the effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to fica tip credits and the non deductibility of incentive stock options 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately to for fiscal however  the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pre tax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an approximate million increase in restaurant sales from new restaurants not in our comparable sales base for the prior period  and an approximate million or increase from comparable restaurant sales  offset by  of additional revenues in fiscal due to the two additional operating days in that year 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales benefited from a menu price increase of approximately with the rest due to increased customer counts and menu mix shifts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily a result of increased costs for seafood and produce  partially offset by the impact of menu price increases 

table of contents we do anticipate that cost of sales in our new restaurants will typically be higher during the first days of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes at our new restaurants 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and therefore we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs  however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurants will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control

labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs decreased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this percentage decrease is primarily due to increased leverage of the fixed component of our labor costs resulting from higher sales  coupled with improved hourly labor productivity which we believe resulted from our new web based labor scheduling and analysis system that was introduced during the first half of for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our restaurants 
occupancy and operating expenses 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the increase reflects additional operating and occupancy expenses related to the new restaurants we opened since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy and operating expenses increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to higher energy costs and increased dining and kitchen supplies partially offset by our ability to leverage the fixed nature of many of these costs as a result of higher comparable sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of included in general and administrative costs for the weeks ended january  is million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of fasb statement no 
r  in january excluding this amount  general and administrative costs increased million  or 
this increase was the result of our planned investments in field supervision and corporate infrastructure to support our growth coupled with higher restaurant management recruiting and training costs 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
approximately basis points of this percentage increase is the result of stock based compensation due to the adoption of fasb statement no 
r in january  with the remaining basis points increase being due primarily to the factors noted above 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment related to new restaurant development 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to increased construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating systems 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of 
table of contents during the weeks ended january  and january   we opened and nine restaurants  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to additional restaurants compared to prior year end and construction rent expensed in the more recent period as a result of our adoption of fsp  effective january our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened  the location of the restaurants  the rental costs of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased by  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase is primarily due to increased investments after the completion of our private placements in march and november coupled with higher interest rates this year compared to the prior year 
other income  net 
net other income decreased to  during comparable weeks ended january  from  during the comparable week period of  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to our decision to discontinue lottery ticket sales in our oregon restaurants 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the comparable week period of the effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to fica tip credits and the non deductibility of incentive stock options 
liquidity and capital resources the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements dollar amounts in thousands january  january  cash and investments net working capital current ratio weeks ended january  january  cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures our capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plans 
while our ability to achieve our growth plans is dependent on a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  our primary growth objective is to achieve a to increase in total restaurant operating weeks during each of fiscal and from the development and opening of new restaurants 
our base of established restaurant operations is not yet large enough to generate enough free cash flow from operations to totally fund our planned expansion indefinitely 
accordingly  we will continue to actively monitor overall conditions in the capital markets with respect to the potential sources and timing of additional financing for our planned future expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
similar to many restaurant chains  we typically utilize operating lease arrangements principally ground leases for the majority of our restaurant locations 
we believe our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not currently required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets  the minimum rents and other related lease obligations  such as common area expenses  under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our 
table of contents capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and brewery operations and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale 
thus  we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our pro rata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
in addition  many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure landlord construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost of constructing the related restaurants 
generally  landlords recover the cost of such contributions from increased minimum rents 
from time to time  we may also decide to purchase the underlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site 
currently  we own the land that underlies four of our restaurants  and we may determine at some future point to monetize those assets through a sale leaseback or other financial transaction 
the majority of our current restaurant locations have been free standing buildings  however  in the future we intend to develop more in line locations in shopping malls  lifestyle centers  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments where greater amounts of landlord construction contributions are typically available to us 
we disburse cash for certain site related work  buildings  leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased and owned premises 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash during the weeks ended january   a million increase from the million generated during the week period of the net increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to the weeks ended january   is primarily due to increased net income  higher depreciation expense due to more restaurants and non cash stock based compensation expense  primarily offset by the increase in accounts and other receivables primarily due to increased credit card deposits in transit and increased tenant allowance receivables 
for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures were million of which expenditures for the acquisition of land  restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the construction of our new restaurants opened by the end of the fiscal year as well as approximately million of expenditures related to new restaurants expected to open in fiscal in addition  total capital expenditures related to the upgrade maintenance of existing restaurants and corporate systems were million and million  respectively 
on november   we sold  shares of common stock to major institutional investors in a pipe private investment in public equity offering at a purchase price of per share for million net of approximately million in related fees and expenses  and  on march   we sold  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share for million net of approximately million in related fees and expenses 
these proceeds are currently being utilized to fund the expansion of our restaurant operations and general corporate purposes 
on december   we established a million unsecured revolving line of credit the line of credit with an original expiration date of december  on october   we replaced this unsecured revolving line of credit with a new million unsecured revolving line of credit with a major financial institution the new line of credit 
the new line of credit expires on september  and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we expect to utilize the new line of credit principally for letters of credit that are required to support certain of our self insurance programs  however  we may use the 
table of contents line of credit from time to time for working capital and construction requirements 
as of january   there were no funded borrowings outstanding under the new line of credit  however  there were outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
any borrowings under the new line of credit will bear interest at the financial institution s prime rate or at libor plus a percentage not to exceed based on a lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the new line of credit agreement 
any interest on the new line of credit will be payable quarterly and all related borrowings must be repaid on or before september  we currently plan to open as many as new restaurants during fiscal as of march   we have entered into eleven signed leases or purchase agreements for those new restaurants  and we expect to enter into additional leases for new restaurant locations 
our capital requirements related to opening additional restaurants will continue to be significant 
we currently anticipate our capital expenditures for  gross of any allowances we may receive from landlords  to be to million related to the construction of new restaurants  the reinvestment in some of our older restaurants as well as normal maintenance capital expenditures and the investment in toolsets and infrastructure 
we expect to fund our expected capital expenditures for with current cash and investment balances  cash flow from operations  landlord contributions and our line of credit 
during fiscal  we are currently expecting to obtain approximately million to million of landlord construction contributions 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  construction costs  the specific sites selected for new restaurants  and the nature of the lease and associated financing arrangements negotiated with landlords 
as of march   we had million of auction rate securities in our short term investment portfolio 
the auction rate securities are aaa rated  long term debt obligations secured by student loans  which loans are generally guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
in addition to the us government guarantee on such student loans  many of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
liquidity for these securities has historically been provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals up to days 
in the past  the auction process has allowed investors to obtain immediate liquidity  if so desired  by selling the securities at their face amounts 
however  recent disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected the auction market for these types of securities 
from february  to march   all auctions scheduled with respect to our auction rate securities have failed to close 
this is the first time we have experienced this type of event with respect to our holdings of auction rate securities 
these securities continue to pay interest at rates that are generally higher than the current market rate  and there has been no change in the rating of these securities to date 
as a result of the failed auctions  these securities are currently not liquid and  furthermore  we cannot predict how long they will remain illiquid 
as such  at least in the near term  we may or may not be able to liquidate some or all of our remaining auction rate securities prior to their maturities at prices approximating their face amounts 
the final maturity dates of the auction rate securities which we own is between and if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we could be required to hold them to maturity 
at this time  we have not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for the need to reclassify to long term investments 
our current and projected cash flow from operations  cash balances on hand  agreed upon landlord construction contributions and our million credit facility  should be sufficient  in the aggregate  to finance our planned capital expenditures an other operating activities through at least fiscal we believe that the current lack of liquidity of our auction rate securities holdings will not have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations or continue our expansion 
however  if current conditions in the auction rate securities market continue for a prolonged period  our longer term financial flexibility could be impacted until other sources of capital are obtained 
while we have a credit facility in place which we may currently draw upon  in the event that global credit market conditions further deteriorate  it is possible that creditors could place limitations or 
table of contents restrictions on the ability of borrowers in general to draw on existing credit facilities 
at this time  however  we have no indication that any such limitations or restrictions are likely to occur 
as an additional liquidity enhancement and at our option  the financial institution that provides our million credit facility has agreed in principle to increase the size of that facility to million  subject to final terms and customary documentation 
sale of pietro s restaurants in february  we executed an agreement to sell our three pietro s restaurants effective on march   resulting in a million pre tax gain 
the buyers  formerly employees  purchased the restaurant assets and related trademarks for the pietro s brand 
the million sales price includes cash proceeds of million and two notes receivable from the buyers totaling  with terms of five and ten years 
the ten year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent with a minimum interest rate of and a maximum interest rate of and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the ten year term 
the five year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the five year term 
our notes are subordinated to the buyer s sba loan 
principal payments to the company on both notes were prohibited for the first six months by the buyer s sba loan 
for these three pietro s restaurants sold  sales were  and  and pre tax income was  and  for the weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
the net book value of the assets sold as of march  was  off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests 
while we have taken steps to enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as produce and fluid dairy items for long periods of time 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations 
many of our restaurant employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in fiscal  congress enacted an increase in the federal minimum wage implemented in three phases  beginning in fiscal and concluding in fiscal in addition  numerous state and local governments increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions  with further state minimum wage increases going into effect in fiscal additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 

table of contents while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices  or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
in addition  during the weeks ended january   we opened our first restaurants in florida  ohio and oklahoma  and accordingly  those restaurants will be impacted by weather and other seasonal factors that typically impact other restaurant operations in those states 
holidays  severe winter weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
when property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of  the asset account and related accumulated depreciation or amortization accounts are relieved  and any gain or loss is included in earnings 
impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairments of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant 
table of contents changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and  significant negative industry or economic trends 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of january   no impairment indicators have been identified 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our employee workers compensation program and our general liability program 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for these programs 
the accrued liability associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on information provided by our insurance broker and insurer  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
as of january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the adoption of fin did not result in an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of january   unrecognized tax benefits recorded was approximately  leases we lease the majority of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  statement no 
 which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of fasb statement no 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we 
table of contents may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that may be reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions can take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us or a combination thereof 
all tenant improvement allowances received by us are recorded as a deferred rent obligation and amortized over the term of the lease 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
beginning january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as pre opening expense  in accordance with fsp once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in some variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans the equity incentive plan and the stock option plan under which we may issue shares of our common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
upon effectiveness of the equity incentive plan  the stock option plan was closed for purposes of new grants 
both of these plans have been approved by our shareholders 
under the equity incentive plan  we have granted incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  and restricted stock units 
beginning in  substantially all of our restaurant general managers  executive kitchen managers  culinary training managers and our area and regional restaurant directors are eligible to participate in a new equity based incentive program called the bj s gold standard stock ownership program the gssop under our equity incentive plan 
in november  we expanded our gssop eligibility to also include certain brewery personnel 
the gssop is a longer term equity incentive program that utilizes company restricted stock units rsus 
the gssop is dependent on each participant s extended service with us in their respective positions five years and their achievement of certain agreed upon performance objectives during that service period 
under the gssop  we issued  rsus 
the fair value of the rsus is the quoted market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each rsu is expensed over the period during which the 
table of contents restrictions are expected to lapse ie  five years 
stock options generally vest at per year or cliff vest  either ratably in years three through five or in year five and expire ten years from date of grant 
restricted stock units generally cliff vest after five years 
we account for these plans under the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation expense recognized in the weeks ended january  and january  include  a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  adoption date of fasb statement r  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
r 
fasb statement no 
r requires us to make certain assumptions and judgments regarding the grant date fair value 
these judgments include expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected option life  dividend yield and vesting percentage 
these estimations and judgments are determined by us using many different variables that  in many cases  are outside of our control 
the changes in these variables or trends  including stock price volatility and risk free interest rate  may significantly impact the grant date fair value resulting in a significant impact to our financial results 
fasb statement no 
r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  statement no 

this statement requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the statement requires prospective application  and the recognition and disclosure requirements are effective for companies with fiscal years ending after december  additionally  fasb statement no 
requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year end balance sheet date 
this requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect the impact of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab  which provides interpretive guidance regarding the consideration given to prior year misstatements when determining materiality in current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amounts of those taxes 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present revenues net of sales taxes 
this eitf will not impact our method for presenting these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 

table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent non cancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and other services 
additionally  we have entered into lease agreements related to future restaurants with commencement dates subsequent to january  our aggregate future commitment relating to these leases is million and is not included in operating leases above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than twelve months as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments was approximately 
as of january   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of approximately million of auction rate securities currently classified as short term investments 
these auction rate securities are aaa rated  long term debt obligations secured by student loans  which are generally guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
in addition to the us government guarantee on such student loans  many of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
liquidity for these securities has historically been provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals up to days 
the final maturity dates of these auction rate securities are between and currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of january   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
additionally  even though we invest our excess cash in instruments that historically have very liquid markets allowing us to convert these investments into cash as needed  there can be no guarantee that the markets supporting these investments will continue 
historically  we have had the option to liquidate our investments in auction rate securities whenever the interest rate on these securities reset as part of the auction process  usually every days or less 
however  if current conditions in the auction rate securities market continue for a prolonged period  our longer term financial flexibility could be impacted until other sources of capital are obtained 
while we have a credit facility in place which we may currently draw upon  in the event that global credit market conditions further deteriorate  it is possible that 
table of contents creditors could place limitations or restrictions on the ability of borrowers in general to draw on existing credit facilities 
at this time  however  we have no indication that any such limitations or restrictions are likely to occur 
as an additional liquidity enhancement and at the company s option  the financial institution that provides us our million credit facility has agreed in principle to increase the size of that facility to million  subject to final terms and customary documentation 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have some flexibility and ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
