estimated remaining contract value our estimated remaining contract value represents total backlog plus management s estimate of future revenue under idiq contracts for task or delivery orders that have not been awarded 
future revenue represents management s 
table of contents estimate of revenue that will be recognized from the end of current task orders until the end of the idiq contract term and is based on our experience and performance under our existing contracts and management judgments and estimates with respect to future task or delivery order awards 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that our existing contracts will result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all 
our estimated remaining contract value could vary or even change significantly depending upon various factors including government policies  government budgets and appropriations  the accuracy of our estimates of work to be performed under time and material contracts and whether we successfully compete with any multiple bidders in idiq contracts

regulatory matters contracts with the us government are subject to certain regulatory requirements 
under us government regulations  certain costs  including certain financing costs  portions of research and development costs  lobbying expenses  certain types of legal expenses and certain marketing expenses related to the preparation of bids and proposals  are not allowed for pricing purposes and calculation of contract reimbursement rates under cost reimbursement contracts 
the us government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs may be allocated under us government contracts 
our government contracts are subject to audits at various points in the contracting process 
pre award audits are performed at the time a proposal is submitted to the us government for cost reimbursement contracts 
the purpose of a pre award audit is to determine the basis of the bid and provide the information required for the us government to negotiate the contract effectively 
in addition  the us government may perform a pre award audit to determine our capability to perform under a contract 
during the performance of a contract  the us government may have the right to examine our costs incurred in the contract  including any labor charges  material purchases and overhead charges 
upon a contract s completion  the us government performs an incurred cost audit of all aspects of contract performance for cost reimbursement contracts to ensure that we have performed the contract in a manner consistent with our proposal 
the government also may perform a post award audit for proposals that are subject to the truth in negotiations act  which are proposals in excess of  to determine if the cost proposed and negotiated was accurate  current and complete as of the time of negotiations 
the defense contract audit agency dcaa performs these audits on behalf of the us government 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and our compliance with  our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
the dcaa has the right to perform audits on our incurred costs on all contracts on a yearly basis 
we have dcaa auditors on site to monitor our billing and back office operations 
an adverse finding under a dcaa audit could result in the disallowance of our costs under a us government contract  termination of us government contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension and prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in the event that an audit by the dcaa recommends disallowance of our costs under a contract  we have the right to appeal the findings of the audit under applicable dispute resolution provisions 
approval of submitted yearly contract incurred costs can take from one to three years from the date of submission of the contract costs 
all of our contract incurred costs for us government contracts completed through fiscal year have been audited by the dcaa and approved by the defense contract management agency 
the audits for such costs during subsequent periods are continuing 
see risk factors a negative audit or other actions by the us government could adversely affect our operating performance 

table of contents at any given time  many of our contracts are under review by the dcaa and other government agencies 
we cannot predict the outcome of such ongoing audits and what  if any  impact such audits may have on our future operating performance

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information contained in this form k 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we rely on sales to us government entities 
a loss of contracts  a failure to obtain new contracts or a reduction of sales under existing contracts with the us government could adversely affect our operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow to fund our operations 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts and subcontracts with the us government and its agencies  primarily the dod and the dos 
the remainder of our revenue is derived from commercial contracts and contracts with foreign governments 
we expect that us government contracts  particularly with the dod and the dos  will continue to be our primary source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the continuation and renewal of our existing government contracts and new government contracts are  among other things  contingent upon the availability of adequate funding for various us government agencies  including the dod and the dos 
changes in us government spending could directly affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
the loss or significant reduction in government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a material decrease to our future sales  earnings and cash flows 
us government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the amount of necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a september fiscal year basis  even though contract periods of 
table of contents performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract is usually partially funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
among the factors that could impact us government spending and reduce our federal government contracting business include the outcome of the us november election  a significant decline in  or reapportioning of  spending by the us government  in general  or by the dod or the dos  in particular  changes  delays or cancellations of us government programs  requirements or policies  the adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies that provide services to the us government  us government shutdowns or other delays in the government appropriations process  curtailment of the us government s outsourcing of services to private contractors  changes in the political climate  including with regard to the funding or operation of the services we provide  and general economic conditions  including a slowdown in the economy or unstable economic conditions in the united states or in the countries in which we operate 
these or other factors could cause us government agencies to reduce their purchases under our contracts  to exercise their right to terminate our contracts in whole or in part  to issue temporary stop work orders  or decline to exercise options to renew  our contracts 
the loss or significant curtailment of our material government contracts  or our failure to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts could adversely affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
our us government contracts may be terminated by the us government at any time prior to their completion and contain other unfavorable provisions  which could lead to an unexpected loss of revenue and a reduction in backlog 
under the terms of our contracts  the us government may unilaterally terminate or modify existing contracts  reduce the value of existing contracts through partial termination  delay the payment of our invoices by government payment offices  audit our contract related costs and fees  and suspend us from receiving new contracts pending the resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 
the us government can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract 
a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
our us government contracts typically have an initial term of one year with multiple option periods  exercisable at the discretion of the government at previously negotiated prices 
the government is not obligated to exercise any option under a contract 
furthermore  the government is typically required to compete all programs and  therefore  may not automatically renew a contract 
in addition  at the time of completion of any of our government contracts  the contract is frequently required to be re competed if the government still requires the services covered by the contract 
if the us government terminates and or materially modifies any of our contracts or if option periods are not exercised  our failure to replace revenue generated from such contracts would result in lower revenue and would 
table of contents likely adversely affect our earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our us government contracts are subject to competitive bidding  both upon initial issuance and re competition 
if we are unable to successfully compete in the bidding process or if we fail to win recompetitions  it could adversely affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
substantially all of our us government contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process upon initial award and renewal  and we expect that this will continue to be the case 
there often is significant competition and pricing pressure as a result of this process 
the competitive bidding process presents a number of risks  including the following we may expend substantial funds and time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may ultimately be awarded to one of our competitors  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to perform any contract we are awarded  which could result in substantial cost overruns  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us  and any such protest or challenge could result in a requirement to resubmit bids on modified specifications or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
additionally  the protest of contracts awarded to us may result in the delay of program performance and the generation of revenues while the protest is pending 
the government contracts for which we compete typically have multiple option periods  and if we fail to win a contract or a task order  we generally will be unable to compete again for that contract for several years 
if we fail to win new contracts or to receive renewal contracts upon re competition  it may result in additional costs and expenses and possible loss of revenue  and we will not have an opportunity to compete for these contract opportunities again until such contracts expire 
because of the nature of our business  it is not unusual for us to lose contracts to competitors or to gain contracts once held by competitors during recompete periods 
additionally  some contracts simply end as projects are completed or funding is terminated 
we have included our most significant contracts by reportable segment in our contract tables in item business  above 
recompete dates are included within the tables to better inform investors regarding the potential impact for our most significant contracts for this risk 
our operations involve considerable risks and hazards 
an accident or incident involving our employees or third parties could harm our reputation  affect our ability to compete for business  and if not adequately insured or indemnified against  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to liabilities arising out of the services we provide 
such liabilities may relate to an accident or incident involving our employees or third parties  particularly where we are deployed on site at active military installations or in locations experiencing political or civil unrest  or they may relate to an accident or incident involving aircraft or other equipment we have serviced or used in the course of our business 
any of these types of accidents or incidents could involve significant potential claims of injured employees and other third parties and claims relating to loss of or damage to government or third party property 
we currently operate in countries such as iraq  where our defensive use of force does not currently subject us or our employees to host country laws or liabilities 
however  legislative initiatives are pending which  if adopted  could significantly alter our exposure and our employees exposure to such laws and liabilities 
such legislation could increase our costs of operations and make it more difficult to recruit employees willing to serve in such places 
we maintain insurance policies that mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our operations 
this insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe is reasonable 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident 

table of contents substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
furthermore  any accident or incident for which we are liable  even if fully insured  may result in negative publicity which could adversely affect our reputation among our customers  including our government customers  and the public  which could result in us losing existing and future contracts or make it more difficult for us to compete effectively for future contracts 
this could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
political destabilization or insurgency in the regions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our operating performance 
certain regions in which we operate are highly unstable 
insurgent activities in the areas in which we operate may cause further destabilization in these regions 
there can be no assurance that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all 
for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   revenue generated from our operations in the middle east contributed  and of our revenue  respectively 
insurgents in iraq and afghanistan have targeted installations where we have personnel and such insurgents have contributed to instability in these countries 
this could impair our ability to attract and deploy personnel to perform services in either or both locations 
in addition  we have been required to increase compensation to our personnel as an incentive to deploy them to these regions 
to date  we have been able to recover this added cost under the contracts  but there is no guarantee that future increases  if required  will be able to be passed onto our customers through our contracts 
to the extent that we are unable to pass through such increased compensation costs to our customers  our operating margins would be adversely impacted  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
in addition  increased insurgent activities or destabilization  including civil unrest or a civil war in iraq or afghanistan  may lead to a determination by the us government to halt our operations in a particular location  country or region and to perform the services using military personnel 
furthermore  in extreme circumstances  the us government may decide to terminate all us government activities including our operations under us government contracts in a particular location  country or region and to withdraw all military personnel 
the change of us presidential administrations in january may lead to policy changes with respect to us government activities in iraq 
congressional pressure to reduce  if not eliminate  the number of us troops in iraq or afghanistan  may also lead to us government procurement actions that reduce or terminate the services and support we provide in that theater of conflict 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional costs and expenses and loss of revenue 
we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
a large portion of our business is conducted internationally 
consequently  we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations  including the following export regulations that could erode profit margins or restricted exports  compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws  treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations  contract award and funding delays  potential restrictions on transfers of funds  foreign currency fluctuations  import and export duties and value added taxes  transportation delays and interruptions  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations  
table of contents requirements by foreign governments that we make a minimum level of local investments as part of our contracts with them  which investments may not yield any return  and potential military conflicts  civil strife and political risks 
while we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business  we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate 
our idiq contracts are not firm orders for services  and we may never receive revenue from these contracts  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
many of our government contracts are idiq contracts  which are often awarded to multiple contractors 
the award of an idiq contract does not represent a firm order for services 
generally  under an idiq contract  the government is not obligated to order a minimum of services or supplies from its contractor  irrespective of the total estimated contract value 
furthermore  under an idiq contract  the customer develops requirements for task orders that are competitively bid against all of the contract awardees  usually under a best value approach 
however  many contracts also permit the government customer to direct work to a specific contractor 
our civilian police  contract field team and logcap iv programs are three of our contracts performed under idiq contracts 
we may not win new task orders under these contracts for various reasons  such as failing to rapidly deploy personnel or high prices  which would have an adverse effect on our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and loss of revenue 
there can be no assurance that our existing idiq contracts will result in actual revenue during any particular period or at all 
in fiscal years ended march   march  and march    and of our revenue  respectively  was attributable to idiq contracts 
our cost of performing under time and materials and fixed price contracts may exceed our revenue which would result in a recorded loss on the contracts 
our government contract services have three distinct pricing structures cost reimbursement  time and materials and fixed price 
with cost reimbursement contracts  so long as actual costs incurred are within the contract funding and allowable under the terms of the contract  we are entitled to reimbursement of the costs plus a stipulated fixed fee and  in some cases  an incentive based award fee 
we assume additional financial risk on time and materials and fixed price contracts  however because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at the stipulated prices or negotiated hourly daily rates 
if we do not accurately estimate ultimate costs and control costs during performance of the work  we could lose money on a particular contract or have lower than anticipated margins 
also  we assume the risk of damage or loss to government property and we are responsible for third party claims under fixed price contracts 
the failure to meet contractually defined performance standards may result in a loss of a particular contract or lower than anticipated margins 
this could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional costs and expenses and possible loss of revenue 
a negative audit or other actions by the us government could adversely affect our operating performance 
at any given time  many of our contracts are under review by the dcaa and other government agencies 
these agencies review our contract performance  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
such dcaa audits may include contracts under which we have performed services in iraq and afghanistan under especially demanding circumstances 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and our compliance with  our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed 
in addition  government contract payments received by us for allowable direct and indirect costs are subject to adjustment after audit by government auditors and repayment to the government if the payments exceed allowable costs as defined in the government contracts 
audits have been completed on our incurred contract costs through fiscal year and the defense contract management agency has approved these costs through fiscal year audits and approvals are continuing for subsequent periods 
we cannot predict the outcome of such audits and what  if any  impact such audits may have on our future operating performance 
for further discussion  see legal proceedings below 

table of contents we are subject to investigation by the us government  which could result in our inability to receive government contracts and could adversely affect our future operating performance 
as a us government contractor  we must comply with laws and regulations relating to us government contracts that do not apply to a commercial company 
from time to time  we are investigated by government agencies with respect to our compliance with these laws and regulations 
if we are found to be in violation of the law  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including contract termination  the assessment of penalties and suspension or prohibition from doing business with us government agencies 
for example  many of the contracts we perform in the us are subject to the service contract act  which requires hourly employees to be paid certain specified wages and benefits 
if the us department of labor determines that we violated the service contract act or its implementing regulations  we could be suspended from being awarded new government contracts or renewals of existing contracts for a period of time  which could adversely affect our future operating performance 
we are subject to a greater risk of investigations  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities than companies with solely commercial customers 
in addition  if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
furthermore  our reputation could suffer serious harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
if we were suspended or prohibited from contracting with the us government  or any significant us government agency  if our reputation or relationship with us government agencies was impaired or if the us government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us  it could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
us government contractors like us that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as iraq have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspector generals  government auditors and congressional committees 
investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and consequent reputational harm  regardless of the underlying merit of the allegations being investigated 
as a matter of general policy  we have cooperated and expect to continue to cooperate with government inquiries of this nature 
the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements could result in increased operating costs or work disruptions  which could potentially affect our operating performance 
as of june   we had approximately  employees located in approximately countries around the world  approximately  of whom are located inside the us of these employees  approximately  are represented by labor unions 
as of june   we had approximately collective bargaining agreements with these unions 
these agreements will expire between july and march there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or otherwise 
we could experience a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members  which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
proceedings against us in domestic and foreign courts could result in legal costs and adverse monetary judgments  adversely affect our operating performance and cause harm to our reputation 
we are involved in various claims and lawsuits from time to time 
for example  we are a defendant in two consolidated lawsuits seeking unspecified damages brought by citizens and certain provinces of ecuador 
the basis for the actions  both pending in us district court for the district of columbia  arises from our performance of a us department of state contract for the eradication of narcotic plant crops in colombia 
the lawsuits allege personal injury  property damage and wrongful death as a consequence of the spraying of narcotic crops along the colombian border adjacent to ecuador 
in the event that a court decides against us in these lawsuits and we are unable to obtain indemnification from the government  or from computer sciences corporation in one of the cases  or contributions from the other defendants  we may incur substantial costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
an adverse ruling in these cases also could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our ability to win future government contracts 

table of contents other litigation in which we are involved includes wrongful termination and other adverse employment actions  breach of contract  personal injury and property damage actions filed by third parties 
actions involving third party liability claims generally are covered by insurance  however  in the event our insurance coverage is inadequate to cover such claims  we will be forced to bear the costs arising from a judgment 
we do not have insurance coverage for adverse employment and breach of contract actions and we bear all costs associated with such litigation and claims 
we are subject to certain us laws and regulations which are the subject of rigorous enforcement by the us government  and our noncompliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our future operating performance 
we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal civil false claims act  which could include claims for treble damages 
government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions  contract termination  forfeiture of profit  and or suspension of payment  any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible government contractor 
we could also suffer serious harm to our reputation 
any interruption or termination of our government contractor status could significantly reduce our future revenues and profits 
to the extent that we export products  technical data and services outside the united states  we are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports  including but not limited to the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries  which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury 
a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil and or criminal sanctions  including the imposition of fines upon us as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts 
we do business in certain parts of the world that have experienced or may be susceptible to governmental corruption 
our corporate policy requires strict compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and with local laws prohibiting payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment 
improper actions by our employees or agents could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines  as well as disgorgement  and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
competition in our industry could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or employees  which could result in a loss of revenue and or a reduction in margins  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
we compete with various entities across geographic and business lines 
competitors of our gs operating segment are various solution providers that compete in any one of the service areas provided by the gs business units 
competitors of our mtss operating segment are typically large defense services contractors that offer services associated with maintenance  training and other activities 
we compete on a number of factors  including our broad range of services  geographic reach  mobility and response time 
foreign competitors may obtain an advantage over us in competing for us government contracts and attracting employees to the extent we are required by us laws and regulations to remit to the us government statutory payroll withholding amounts for us nationals working on us government contracts while employed by our foreign subsidiaries  since foreign competitors may not be similarly obligated by their governments 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources or are otherwise better positioned than us to compete for contract opportunities 
for example  original equipment manufacturers that also provide aftermarket support services have a distinct advantage in obtaining service contracts for aircraft that they have manufactured  as they frequently have better access to replacement and service parts as well as an existing technical understanding of the platform they have manufactured 
in addition  we are at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts put up for re competition for which we are not the incumbent provider  because incumbent providers are frequently able to capitalize on customer relationships  technical knowledge and pricing experience gained from their prior service 

table of contents in addition to the competition we face in bidding for contracts and task orders  we must also compete to attract the skilled and experienced personnel integral to our continued operations 
we hire from a limited pool of potential employees  as military and law enforcement experience  specialized technical skill sets and security clearances are prerequisites for many positions 
our failure to compete effectively for employees  or excessive attrition among our skilled personnel  could reduce our ability to satisfy our customers needs and increase the costs and time required to perform our contractual obligations 
this could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
loss of our skilled personnel  including members of senior management  may have an adverse effect on our operations and or our operating performance 
our continued success depends in large part on our ability to recruit and retain the skilled personnel necessary to serve our customers effectively  including personnel with extensive military and law enforcement training and backgrounds 
the proper execution of our contract objectives depends upon the availability of quality resources  especially qualified personnel 
given the nature of our business  we have substantial need for personnel who are willing to work overseas  frequently in locations experiencing political or civil unrest  for extended periods of time and often on short notice 
we may not be able to meet the need for qualified personnel as such need arises 
in addition  we must comply with provisions in us government contracts that require employment of persons with specified work experience and security clearances 
an inability to maintain employees with the required security clearances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to win new business and satisfy our existing contractual obligations  and could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
the loss of services of any of the members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found 
there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
if our subcontractors or joint venture partners fail to perform their contractual obligations  then our performance as the prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
these subcontractors generally perform niche or specialty services for which they have more direct experience  such as construction  catering services or specialized technical services  or they have local knowledge of the region in which we will be performing and the ability to communicate with local nationals and assist in making arrangements for commencement of performance 
often  we enter into subcontract arrangements in order to meet government requirements to award certain categories of services to small businesses 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor 
such subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
we often enter into joint ventures so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project 
the success of these and other joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our joint venture partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the joint ventures may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve 

table of contents environmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect our operating performance 
we are subject to numerous environmental  legal and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide 
in the us  these laws and regulations include those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the maintenance of a safe workplace  primarily associated with our aviation services activities  including painting aircraft and handling substances that may qualify as hazardous waste  such as used batteries and petroleum products 
in addition to us federal laws and regulations  states and other countries where we do business have numerous environmental  legal and regulatory requirements by which we must abide 
we could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  as a result of violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
this could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
our substantial outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit our operating and financial flexibility 
we are required to make mandatory payments and  under certain circumstances  mandatory prepayments on our outstanding indebtedness 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes and could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us and limit management s discretion in operating our businesses 
these agreements limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee obligations  make capital expenditures  prepay indebtedness prior to stated maturities  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  make investments or acquisitions  create liens or other encumbrances  transfer or sell certain assets  and merge or consolidate with another entity 
in addition  our senior secured credit facilities contain covenants requiring us to deliver to our lenders leverage and interest coverage financial computations and our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and an adverse development affecting our business could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  alternative or additional sources of financing or reductions in expenditures 
we cannot assure you that such waivers  amendments or alternative or additional financings could be obtained  or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our substantial level of indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capitalize on business opportunities or respond to adverse changes in our industry 
as of march   we had million of total indebtedness and million of additional borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility which gives effect to the million of outstanding letters of credit 
based on our indebtedness and other obligations as of march   we estimate our remaining contractual commitments including interest associated with our indebtedness and other obligations will be 
table of contents million in the aggregate for the remaining period between march  through the end of fiscal such indebtedness could have material consequences for our business  operations and liquidity position  including the following it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  debt service requirements  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available for other purposes  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in our industry as compared to our competitors may be compromised due to the high level of indebtedness  and our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited 
servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our senior secured credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements  including our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes  may restrict us from carrying out any of these alternatives 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms  it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition 
despite our current indebtedness level  we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt  which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
as of march   we had up to million of additional availability under our senior secured credit facility which gives effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of the senior secured credit facility and our senior subordinated notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
it is not possible to quantify the specific dollar amount of indebtedness we may incur because our senior secured credit facility does not provide for a specific dollar amount of indebtedness we may incur 
our senior secured credit facility and our senior subordinated notes allow us to incur only certain indebtedness that is expressly enumerated in our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
the indebtedness permitted under our senior secured credit facility includes indebtedness that is customary for similar credit facilities 
specific examples of indebtedness permitted under our senior secured credit facility are described further under notes to the consolidated financial statements and include certain intercompany indebtedness  indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility  the senior subordinated notes  certain refinancing indebtedness and certain indebtedness with respect to capital leases in an amount that may not exceed million 
we believe that the comparable restrictions in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes have restrictions that are generally no more restrictive in any material respect than the senior secured credit facility 
if either we or our subsidiaries were to incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that we now face could increase

the selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the period from february  through april  and as of and for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  are derived from our consolidated financial statements  referred to as the successor period 
we report the results of our operations using a week basis 
in line with this reporting schedule  each quarter of the fiscal year will contain weeks except for the infrequent fiscal years with weeks 
the fiscal year ended april  was a week year 
the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  were week years

the company defines ebitda as gaap net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and income taxes 
the company s management uses ebitda as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of the company s business and believes that ebitda provides a meaningful measure of its operational performance on a consolidated basis because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes  costs associated with capital investments and interest expense and is consistent with one of the measures used by the company to evaluate management s performance for incentive compensation 
ebitda is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating ebitda  investors should consider  among other factors  i increasing or decreasing trends in ebitda  ii whether ebitda has remained at positive levels historically  and iii how ebitda compares to the company s debt outstanding 
the non gaap measure of ebitda does have certain limitations 
it does not include interest expense  which is a necessary and ongoing part of the company s cost structure resulting from debt incurred to expand operations 
ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses 
because these are material and recurring items  any measure that excludes them has a material limitation 
to mitigate these limitations  the company has policies and procedures in place to identify expenses that qualify as interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and to approve and segregate these expenses from other expenses to ensure that the company s ebitda is consistently reflected from period to period 
ebitda excludes some items that affect net income and may vary among companies 
ebitda presented by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not give effect to the cash the company must use to service its debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from operations or actually available for capital investments 
backlog data is as of the end of the applicable period

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
please see risk factors and forward looking statements for a discussion of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts discussed herein are consolidated 
all references in this annual report to fiscal years of the us government pertain to the fiscal year which ends on september th of each year 
company overview we are a leading provider of specialized mission critical outsourced technical services to civilian and military government agencies 
our specific global expertise is in law enforcement training and support  security services  base operations and aviation services  construction and operations  which we provide through two business segments  gs and mtss 
we also provide logistics support for of all our services 
our current customers include the dos  the us army  air force  navy and marine corps collectively  the dod  commercial customers and foreign governments 
as of march   we had approximately  employees in more than countries  approximately active contracts ranging in duration from three to ten years and approximately task orders 
dyncorp international and its predecessors have provided essential services to numerous us government departments and agencies since operating environment over most of the last two decades  the us government has been increasing its reliance on the private sector for a wide range of professional and support services 
this increased use of outsourcing by the us government has been driven by a variety of factors lean government initiatives launched in the s  surges in demand during times of national crisis  the increased complexity of missions  the shift in the strategic planning of the us military to focus on the war fighter efforts and the loss of skills within the government caused by workforce reductions and retirements 
these factors lead us to believe that the us government s growing mission and continued human capital challenges have combined to create a new market dynamic  one that is less directly reflective of overall 
table of contents government budgets and more reflective of the ongoing shift of service delivery from the federal workforce to core competent  efficient private sector providers 
the outcome of the us november election could have an effect on the future dod budget and the course of government spending on outsourcing 
the dod expects it will preside over a budget that could soon reach a record billion depending on the outcome of recent war supplemental legislation 
the dod s fiscal regular request is billion  nearly a increase since  and there is a billion placeholder allowance for war costs  although the pentagon admits that the allowance would only provide enough money for war costs until january or so 
when all supplementals are approved  the dod budget could top billion 
we believe the following industry trends will further increase demand and enable us to more successfully compete for outsourced services in our target markets a shift in the strategic planning of the us military  leading to increases in outsourcing of non combat functions  an increased level and frequency of overseas deployment and peace keeping operations for the dos  dod and united nations  growth in the us military budget in operations and maintenance spending accounts  an increased maintenance  overhaul and upgrade needs to support aging military platforms  increased reliance on private contractors to perform life cycle asset management functions ranging from organizational to depot level maintenance  increased opportunities to support foreign governments in providing a wide spectrum of maintenance  supply support  facilities management and construction management related services  and a shift from single award to more multiple award idiq contracts 
recent developments global linguist solutions llc in march  gls  a joint venture between dyncorp international and mcneil technologies  was allowed  after protests and appeals dating back to december  to resume performance on the inscom contract by the us army for the management of linguist and translation services in support of the military mission known as oif 
this five year contract  with a maximum value of billion and a current awarded value of billion  was originally awarded in december the us army terminated the first award for convenience after the government accountability office sustained a protest filed by the incumbent 
inscom subsequently requested and reviewed revised proposals and again awarded the contract to gls 
the incumbent protested this second award and the us army decided to take corrective action  resulting in dismissal of the second protest 
consequently  the us army implemented a corrective action plan which resulted in a decision to support its december award to gls 
under the contract  gls will provide rapid recruitment  deployment  and on site management of interpreters and translators in theater for a wide range of foreign languages 
this effort will support the us army  its unified commands  attached forces  combined forces  and joint elements executing the oif mission  and other us government agencies supporting the oif mission 
the foreign language interpretation and translation services provided by gls under this contract will allow oif forces to communicate with the local populace  gather information for force protection  and interact with other foreign military units 
gls is expected to employ up to  locally hired translators and up to  us citizens with security clearances who are fluent in the languages spoken in iraq 
logistics civil augmentation program in april  after extended protest and review  the us army sustainment command selected dyncorp international  along with kbr inc and flour corporation as the providers of logistics support to the us army 
table of contents under the logcap iv contract 
the logcap iv contract has a ceiling value of billion with a term of up to years and an annual ceiling value to dyncorp international of billion in revenue per year 
task orders will be competed on with the other two awardees and will vary depending from year to year depending on us army funding and strategic objectives 
under this contract  our company will support us forces worldwide with immediate focus on those deployed in the middle east 
logcap iv is the us army component of the dod s efforts to award contracts to us companies for a broad range of logistics to support services to us and allied forces during combat  peacekeeping  humanitarian  and training operations 
these services include facilities  supplies  maintenance  and transportation 
the logcap objective is to use civilian contractors to perform selected services in a theater of operations to augment us army forces and release military units for other missions or to fill us army resource shortfalls

cost of services cost of services is comprised of direct labor  direct materials  subcontractor costs  other direct costs and overhead 
other direct costs include travel  supplies  and miscellaneous costs 
cost of services for fiscal increased million or primarily due to growth in operations 
as a percentage of revenue  costs of services decreased to for fiscal year ended march  from for fiscal year ended march  the key factors contributing to the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue were continued strong performance of fixed price task orders combined with contract modifications for construction efforts completed in earlier periods within the gs segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or as compared with the fiscal year ended march  factors contributing to the increased sg a included i litigation costs associated primarily with the wwns litigation  ii costs incurred in fiscal related to our sarbanes oxley compliance preparation  iii consulting costs related to proposal activity for potential new contracts  and iv general sg a costs necessary to support the current and anticipated growth of the company s business 
offsetting these increases were i non recurring severance costs incurred in fiscal for certain former executives  and ii bonus compensation incurred in fiscal associated with the company s equity offering 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or as compared to the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the effects of acquired software becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year

government services fiscal year ended march  march  inc dec revenue operating income during our fiscal first quarter  certain contracts were reclassified between our two segments 
for comparability  we have recasted our fiscal and revenue and operating income related to these contracts within our md a discussion and within note to our consolidated financial statements 
the recasting had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents revenue revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase primarily resulted from the following fluctuations within our sbus as viewed by segment management law enforcement and security revenue decreased million primarily due to a decline in revenue from our operations in iraq of million offset by an increase in afghanistan of million 
an additional million increase was attributable mainly to non recurring work in other middle eastern nations 
in iraq we experienced a million decrease in our civpol services due to the transition of our operations from leased facilities to customer furnished facilities 
as we had operated these leased locations and earned revenue through task orders  this planned transition from these facilities negatively affected our civpol revenue 
despite the decline from the relocation  our core civpol personnel levels remained consistent in iraq and were not a driver of the decrease 
the remaining decrease in revenue from our operations in iraq was driven primarily by declines in non recurring work associated with our personal protection services of million 
we are continuing to pursue new opportunities in the iraq theatre for these services in fiscal the increase in revenue from our operations in afghanistan was due largely to increased personnel levels as well as additional services associated with the afghan poppy eradication program 
while iraq and afghanistan have been the primary regions of growth for our various law enforcement and security services  we are expecting growth from new regions such as palestine  haiti  lebanon and mexico in fiscal contingency and logistics operations revenue decreased by million primarily due to non recurring revenue associated with hurricane katrina in fiscal we expect growth to resume in our contingency and logistics operations services with the addition of logcap iv awarded in april operations maintenance and construction management revenue increased million due to the ramp up in various construction projects in regions including africa and afghanistan 
our strategic focus has been on our construction services where we are executing a strategy that includes capitalizing on our construction expertise and our global resources in these areas 
because of our focus on this aspect of the business  growth in construction has outpaced our other services within this sbu  such as equipment positioning and military logistics 
continued growth is expected in our construction services through new opportunities and ramp up of early stage projects in process at the end of fiscal while growth in our other services is anticipated to be flat in the upcoming year 
specialty aviation and counter drug operations revenue increased million primarily due to a million increase in drug eradication services and million of increase in other services 
our drug eradication services continue to grow through increases in our scope of services for these projects 
we experienced significant growth in afghanistan where our services have played a key role in reducing narcotics in that country 
we are expecting a continued shift in our services out of regions such as central and south america and into the middle east 
growth in other services includes counter narcotics technologies and forestry support services 
these services are typically non recurring and are not a significant aspect of our future growth strategy 
global linguist solutions revenue was million for the new inscom contract through our gls joint venture which began in our fiscal fourth quarter 
we are anticipating significant revenue growth in fiscal as a result of services provided under the inscom contract 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the decrease primarily resulted from the following law enforcement and security operating income increased million as a result of improved contract performance and elimination of non recurring write offs from contract losses that occurred in the prior year 
our improved contract performance was primarily a result of effective cost management strategies executed in fiscal which allowed us to improve operating income despite a decline in revenue for our services within this sbu 
contingency and logistics operations operating income decreased by million primarily due to the decline in revenue for non recurring projects as discussed above 

table of contents operations maintenance and construction management continued growth through the ramp up of new construction projects helped increase our operating income by million 
specialty aviation and counter drug operations operating income decreased million due to charges related to non fee bearing  unscheduled maintenance of aircraft during the fiscal year 
while the nature of this incremental work had a positive and significant impact on revenue  its structure as a cost reimbursable only contract did not provide a benefit to operating income 
global linguist solutions start up costs associated with this contract contributed to a decrease in our operating income of million through the fiscal year ended march  general sg a factors we incurred a decrease of million in operating income related to sg a expenses in the current fiscal year 
the fluctuation was due primarily to additional expenses from proposal costs associated with inscom and logcap iv  specific contract litigation expenses associated with the wwns litigation  further described in item legal proceedings  and increases in necessary support functions associated with our current and anticipated growth 
these cost increases were offset by one time costs incurred in the prior year related to severance expenses for certain former executives and bonus compensation associated with the company s initial public offering 
maintenance technical support services the following table sets forth the revenue and operating income for the mtss operating segment  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  in thousands 
fiscal year ended march  march  increase revenue operating income during our fiscal first quarter  certain contracts were reclassified between our two segments 
for comparability  we have recasted our fiscal and revenue and operating income related to these contracts within our md a discussion and within note to our consolidated financial statements 
the recasting had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
revenue revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase primarily resulted from the following fluctuations within our sbas as viewed by segment management contract logistics support revenue increased million due to escalating support requirements associated with our life cycle contractor support lccs programs which include various services such as overhauls  support personnel and equipment supply  primarily for deployments in iraq and afghanistan 
the increase was driven by shorter time periods between field overhauls on engines and propellers which are two of our key services 
a trend of higher overhauls was noted during the year due to a combination of factors including longer equipment deployments  higher flight volumes and the harsh desert conditions in those regions 
field service operations revenue decreased million due to a temporary decline in personnel and level of services provided resulting from longer deployment cycles of equipment in iraq and afghanistan 
while the longer deployment cycles have benefited our contract logistics support sba  it has created a temporary decline in our fso as planes and equipment are not rotated out of the theatre as frequently for complete resetting overhauls 
we anticipate revenue increasing as equipment cycles return to normal in the upcoming fiscal year 
aviation maintenance services revenue increased million primarily due to increased work associated with mine resistant vehicles and new threat management systems offset by normal occurrence of completed projects 
while much of the increased revenue from our work on threat management systems is non recurring  we do anticipate continued revenue growth in the near term from mine resistant vehicles 

table of contents operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase primarily resulted from the following contract logistics support operating income increased million due to better margins realized on higher revenue associated with our lccs programs primarily supporting deployments in iraq and afghanistan in addition to non recurring losses from fiscal associated with our commercial support services css program 
field service operations operating income decreased million due to lower revenue offset by lower operating costs 
the lower revenue created an undesirable cost structure due to the nature of our services within this sba 
as we anticipate revenue returning to normal levels going forward our operating income is expected to also improve 
aviation maintenance services operating income increased million which was a net decrease in margin from in fiscal to in fiscal the net decline in margin percentage for this sba was due to several high margin non recurring projects in fiscal in addition to no margin cost reimbursement only projects for aircraft maintenance which increased revenue but ultimately reduced operating margin percentages 
general sg a factors we incurred an increase of million in operating income related to sg a expenses in the current fiscal year 
the fluctuation was primarily due to one time costs incurred in the prior year related to severance expenses for certain former executives and bonus compensation associated with our initial public offering

liquidity and capital resources cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our senior credit facility are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and our available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  to support growth related to potential contract awards and task orders that could occur in the next twelve months  we may require additional financing beyond that currently provided by our senior credit facility 
we are currently evaluating our available financing options  which generally are on terms acceptable to the company  although potentially at higher than current costs due to market conditions 
we believe these options will provide us with the financial flexibility to support our expected growth and related working capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that sufficient debt financing will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially affect the company s operations in the short term and hinder expansion strategies 
consolidated cash flows the following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein fiscal year ended march  march  march  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided by used by financing activities operating cash flow  a key source of the company s liquidity  was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the fiscal year the decrease in operating cash flow compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to changes in working capital  particularly in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million offset by a net release of restricted cash in the current year as compared to a net use of cash in fiscal which had a net impact of million 
the million increase in net income also helped offset the decreases from working capital 
the changes in working capital were due to the timing of collections along with business growth from new customers net of gls expenditures in the fourth quarter 
operating cash flow was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to the fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to earnings growth of million 
table of contents and cash flows provided by working capital of million  particularly  accounts payable and accrued liability activities related to the timing of payroll processing  interest payments and customer advances 
the timing for payroll processing  interest payments and customer advances can vary from quarter to quarter 
partially offsetting the increased operating cash flow was the payment of special cash bonuses subsequent to the equity offering of million in the aggregate to our executive officers and certain other members of management 
these bonuses rewarded management for their efforts in connection with the successful consummation of our equity offering 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a permanent investment in an unconsolidated equity investee 
cash flows related to investing consisted primarily of cash used for capital expenditures 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million for the fiscal capital spending related to the purchase of property and equipment increased million in from levels to million  primarily due to purchase of vehicles  equipment and for certain leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures are made primarily due to contractual requirements 
we customarily lease our vehicles and equipment and intend to continue our practice of leasing our vehicles and equipment in the future 
our senior secured credit facility limits our annual capital expenditures related to the purchase of property and equipment to million 
we do not expect this limitation to have a material effect on our business 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the cash used by financing activities was primarily related to the repayment of borrowings under our term loans of million and net repayments made under other financing arrangements of million 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the fiscal  compared to cash flows used of million for the fiscal year financing activities during the fiscal year included i gross proceeds received from our equity offering of million  ii payment of equity offering costs of approximately million  iii partial redemption of senior subordinated notes of million  including accrued interest  iv redemption of all outstanding preferred stock and related accrued and unpaid interest of million  and v payment of special class b distribution of million 
the cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was due to the million repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the million scheduled repayment of our bank note borrowings  the million payment of offering expenses and the million purchase of an interest rate cap that limits our exposure to upward movements in variable rate debt 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and our available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
financing long term debt consisted of march  march  dollars in thousands term loans senior subordinated notes less current portion of long term debt total long term debt 
table of contents our senior secured credit facility is comprised of senior secured term loans term loans of up to million  and a senior secured revolving credit facility revolving facility of up to million 
the term loans are due in quarterly payments of million through april   and million thereafter  with final payment due february  borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the company and the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility also provides for a commitment guarantee of a maximum of million  as amended  for letters of credit 
the senior secured credit facility requires letter of credit fees up to  payable quarterly in arrears on the amount available for drawing under all letters of credit 
the fee was at march  borrowings under our term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the debt agreement

table of contents backlog we track backlog in order to assess our current business development effectiveness and to assist us in forecasting our future business needs and financial performance 
our backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts under contracts 
funded backlog is equal to the amounts actually appropriated by a customer for payment of goods and services less actual revenue recognized as of the measurement date under that appropriation 
unfunded backlog is the actual dollar value of unexercised priced contract options 
most of our us government contracts allow the customer the option to extend the period of performance of a contract for a period of one or more years 
these priced options may or may not be exercised at the sole discretion of the customer 
historically  it has been our experience that the customer has typically exercised contract options 
firm funding for our contracts is usually made for one year at a time  with the remainder of the contract period consisting of a series of one year options 
as is the case with the base period of our us government contracts  option periods are subject to the availability of funding for contract performance 
the us government is legally prohibited from ordering work under a contract in the absence of funding 
our historical experience has been that the government has typically funded the option periods of our contracts 
the following table sets forth our approximate backlog as of the dates indicated march  march  march  dollars in millions gs funded backlog unfunded backlog total gs backlog mtss funded backlog unfunded backlog total mtss backlog total consolidated funded backlog unfunded backlog total consolidated backlog as of march  and march   the backlog related to gls was billion and billion  respectively 
we do anticipate our new logcap iv contract will impact backlog in the future as the total maximum award available to our company per fiscal year is approximately billion 
although the logcap iv contract is an idiq arrangement which typically does not impact backlog as significantly as other contract types  the potential size of the contract is such that its impact could be significant 
as the award was not finalized until after march   there is no impact from logcap iv in the above table 
estimated remaining contract value our estimated remaining contract value represents total backlog plus management s estimate of future revenue under idiq contracts for task or delivery orders that have not been awarded 
future revenue represents management s estimate of revenue that will be recognized from the end of current task orders until the end of the idiq contract term and is based on our experience and performance under our existing contracts and management judgments and estimates with respect to future task or delivery order awards 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that our existing contracts will result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all 
our estimated remaining contract value could vary or even change significantly 
table of contents depending upon government policies  government budgets and appropriations 
the following table sets forth our estimated remaining contract value as of the dates indicated march  march  march  dollars in millions gs estimated remaining contract value mtss estimated remaining contract value total estimated remaining contract value off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements relate to letters of credit and operating lease obligations  which are excluded from the balance sheet in accordance with gaap 
the company s letters of credit and lease obligations are described in notes and  respectively  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the future operating lease expense is reflected in the contractual commitments  above 
effects of inflation we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts 
bids for longer term fixed price and time and materials type contracts typically include sufficient labor and other cost escalations in amounts expected to cover cost increases over the period of performance 
consequently  because costs and revenue include an inflationary increase commensurate with the general economy in which we operate  net income as a percentage of revenue has not been significantly impacted by inflation 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
these significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed quarterly by management with oversight by the disclosure control committee the disclosure control committee  an internal committee comprised of members of senior management 
the disclosure control committee presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition the company is predominantly a services provider and only includes products or systems when necessary for the execution of the service arrangement and as such  systems  equipment or materials are not generally separable from services 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or products have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
each arrangement is unique and revenue recognition is evaluated on a contract by contract basis 
our contracts typically fall into four categories with the first representing the vast majority of our revenue 
the other contract types are federal government contracts  construction type contracts or software contracts or multiple arrangement type contracts 
the company applies the appropriate guidance consistently to similar contracts 

table of contents the company expenses pre contract costs as incurred for an anticipated contract until the contract is awarded 
throughout the life of the contract  indirect costs  including general and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and are based on dcaa approved indirect rates 
management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
major factors the company considers in determining total estimated revenue and cost include the basic contract price  contract options  change orders modifications of the original contract  back charges and claims  and contract provisions for penalties  award fees and performance incentives 
all of these factors and other special contract provisions are evaluated throughout the life of the company s contracts when estimating total contract revenue under the percentage of completion or proportional methods of accounting 
federal government contracts for all non construction and non software us federal government contracts or contract elements  the company applies the guidance in the aicpa accounting and auditing guide  federal government contractors aag fgc 
the company applies the combination and segmentation guidance in the aag fgc in analyzing the deliverables contained in the applicable contract to determine appropriate profit centers 
revenue is recognized by profit center using the percentage of completion method or complete contract method 
projects under the company s us federal government contracts typically have different pricing mechanisms that influence how revenue is earned and recognized 
these pricing mechanisms are classified as cost plus fixed fee  fixed price  cost plus award fee  time and materials including unit price level of effort contracts  or idiq 
the exact timing and quantity of delivery for idiq profit centers are not known at the time of contract award  but they can contain any type of pricing mechanism 
revenue on projects with a fixed price or fixed fee is generally recognized ratably over the contract period measured by either output or input methods appropriate to the services or products provided 
for example  output measures can include period of service  such as for aircraft fleet maintenance  and units delivered or produced  such as aircraft for which modification has been completed 
input measures can include a cost to cost method  such as for procurement related services 
revenue on time and materials projects is recognized at contractual billing rates for applicable units of measure eg labor hours incurred  units delivered 
the completed contract method is sometimes used when reliable estimates cannot be supported for percentage of completion method recognition or for short duration projects when the results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from use of the percentage of completion method 
until complete  project costs are maintained in work in progress  a component of inventory 
construction contracts or contract elements for all construction contracts or contract elements  revenue is recognized by profit center using the percentage of completion method 
software contracts or contract elements it is the company s policy to review any arrangement containing software or software deliverables using applicable gaap guidance for software revenue recognition to ensure accurate accounting of these arrangements as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company has never sold software on a separate  standalone basis 
as a result  software arrangements are typically accounted for as one unit of accounting and are recognized over the service period  including the period of post contract customer support 
other contracts or contract elements the company s contracts with non federal government customers are predominantly multiple element 
multiple element arrangements involve multiple obligations in various combinations to perform services  deliver equipment or materials  grant licenses or other rights  or take certain actions 
the company evaluates all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting and arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
fair values are established by evaluating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence if available 
due to the customized nature of the company s arrangements  vsoe and third party evidence is generally not available resulting in applicable arrangements being accounted for as one unit of accounting 

table of contents deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in potential assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
on march   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fin no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
equity based compensation expense the company has adopted the provisions of and accounted for equity based compensation in accordance with fasb no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions  equity based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for equity awards or is 
table of contents revalued each accounting period for liability awards 
see note of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 
we currently have two types of share based payment awards  restricted stock units rsus and class b membership interests in div the class b membership interests 
our rsus are classified as liability awards under gaap and are thus revalued based on our closing stock price at the end of each accounting period 
the class b membership interests are considered equity awards under gaap and were valued at the grant date using the black scholes model 
the determination of the fair value of the class b membership interests is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions including volatility  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero in the pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our share based payment awards typically vest ratably over the requisite service periods  which differs from our recognition of compensation expense that is recognized on an accelerated basis over the awards requisite service periods 
recent accounting pronouncements the information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the inherent risk in market risk sensitive instruments and positions primarily relates to potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for further discussion of market risks we may encounter  see risk factors 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk relating to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the prime rate or libor  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the debt agreement 
the applicable margins for the prime rate and libor as of march  were and  respectively 
as of march   we had million of indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes and excluding accrued interest thereon  of which million was secured 
on the same date  we had approximately million available under our senior secured credit facility which gives effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
each quarter point change in interest rates results in approximately million change in annual interest expense on the term loan 
the table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt agreements  as of march  expected maturity as of march  average fiscal year interest thereafter total rate dollars in thousands fixed rate variable rate total debt 
table of contents the fair value of our term loan borrowings under the senior secured credit facility is approximately million and is based on quoted market values 
the fair value of senior subordinated notes is approximately million based on their quoted market value 
the above table does not give effect to million of outstanding letters of credit as of march  during fiscal  in order to mitigate interest rate risk related to the term loans  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
the interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate at  including applicable margin of at march   on the first million of our debt indexed to libor 
the notional principal of million is protected through september and the remaining million is protected through may the company concluded that the interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates 
at present  we do not utilize any derivative instruments to manage risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the functional currency of certain foreign operations is the local currency 
accordingly  these foreign entities translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
management has determined that our foreign currency transactions are not material
