overview through skywest airlines and asa  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and asa offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with more than  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
additionally  as of december   we provided ground handling services for approximately ten other airlines throughout our system 
as of december   we operated a combined fleet of aircraft consisting of crjs assigned to united  assigned to delta and assigned to midwest crjs assigned to united and assigned to delta  crjs all assigned to delta  brasilia turboprops assigned to united and assigned to delta  and atr turboprops all assigned to delta 
we believe our success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with major airline partners is attributable to our delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet at a competitive cost structure 
for the month ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated under the delta code  approximately was operated under the united code and approximately was operated under the midwest code 
skywest airlines has been a partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest airlines expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest airlines expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
skywest airlines and midwest entered into the midwest services agreement on december  under the terms of the midwest services agreement  skywest airlines has agreed to operate up to crjs 
the initial aircraft were delivered by september  on january   the company announced that skywest airlines agreed to operate additional aircraft under the midwest services agreement 
we serve markets from midwest s current hubs in milwaukee and kansas city 
as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city  a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest  and a midwest connect carrier in milwaukee and kansas city operating more than  total daily flights 
asa has been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since asa expanded its operations as a delta connection carrier to also include cincinnati and salt lake city in september and april  respectively 
asa operates approximately daily flights  all in the delta connection system 
we provide a substantial majority of regional airline service for delta in atlanta and salt lake city 
in connection with our acquisition of asa in september  we established new  separate  but substantially similar  long term fixed fee delta connection agreements with delta for both skywest airlines and asa 
we also obtained the right to use gates in the hartsfield jackson international airport located in atlanta  from which we currently provide service to delta 
delta has also agreed that  starting in  if delta solicits requests for proposals to fly delta connection regional aircraft  asa will be permitted to bid to maintain the same percentage of total delta connection regional jet flights that it flies during  and  if asa does not achieve the winning bid for the proposed flying  asa will be permitted to match the terms of the winning bid to the extent necessary for asa to maintain its percentage of delta connection regional jet flying that it operated during historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenue 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
financial highlights we had operating revenues of billion for the year ended december   an increase  compared to billion for the year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of  or per diluted share  compared to million of net income or per diluted share  for the year ended december  total available seat miles asms for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in our fleet size to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december  during the year ended december   we took delivery of eight new crjs and acquired used crjs and used crj s from another operator 
during the year ended december   we generated billion asms  compared to billion asms during at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  compared to approximately million as of december  during the year ended december   we spent approximately million to purchase and retire approximately  shares of common stock 
of the eight new crjs we acquired during the year ended december   we financed seven aircraft under long term debt arrangements and one aircraft under a lease arrangement 
the ten crjs we acquired during the year ended december  were acquired under sublease arrangements with a major partner at nominal monthly amounts 
of the eleven used crjs  we financed ten aircraft under lease arrangements and one was purchased with cash 
outlook on october   we announced that skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which we intend to operate for united express  as part of an aircraft transition plan  allowing united express to remove emb seat turboprop aircraft from the contract reimbursement model in the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
generally  the turboprop removals are intended to occur in conjunction with deliveries of new regional jet aircraft in order to ensure a smooth transition in existing markets 
additionally  skywest airlines intends to exchange four seat crjs for four crjs configured with seats in its delta connection operations 
on november   we announced that we placed a firm order for aircraft with bombardier aerospace 
we are scheduled to take delivery of these aircraft beginning in late and continue through the first quarter of on january   we announced that skywest airlines has agreed to operate additional aircraft under the midwest services agreement 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles and stock based compensation expense as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed  thus substantially reducing significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the engine 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs 
under the terms of the agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while asa s aircraft are primarily debt financed on a long term basis 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of asa 
the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether the book value of our aircraft is impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
applying sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 
results of operations compared to operating statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the percentage of change for the years identified below 
year ended december  change revenue passenger miles   available seat miles   block hours   departures   passengers carried   passenger load factor pts passenger breakeven load factor pts yield per revenue passenger mile revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles revenue passenger miles and available seat miles 
our total revenue passenger miles rpms generated during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  our total asms generated during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  the increase in rpms and asms was primarily a result of increasing the size of our aircraft fleet from as of december  to as of december  additionally  our average passenger trip length increased from miles as of december  to miles as of december   primarily due to the increased number of crjs and crjs we placed into service since december   which typically operate over longer stage lengths 
block hours and departures 
our block hours increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in block hours was primarily due to the increase in fleet size from to and due to increased daily average utilization of the fleet from to our departures increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was also primarily due to the increase in our fleet size from to the percentage increase in departures was lower than the percentage increase in block hours from to  primarily due to the increased stage lengths we experienced in passengers carried and passenger load factor 
our passenger load factor decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  during the year ended december   approximately of our asms were generated by our contract flying  where delta  united or midwest controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories 
our contract flying routes primarily supplement delta  united and midwest mainline service in previously established and developed markets 
changes made by delta  united and midwest in their respective ticket pricing  scheduling and seat inventories impact our load factor 
revenue per available seat mile 
our revenue per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  under our contract flying arrangements with delta and united  we are compensated for our direct fuel expenses  which we record as revenue 
the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  however  despite the increase in the average cost per gallon  during the year ended december   united purchased fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our aircraft operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver  which reduced our fuel costs and related passenger revenue compared to the year ended december  by approximately million 
our operating revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the increase in our fleet size from aircraft as of december  to aircraft as of december  our passenger revenues  which represented of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to billion for the year ended december   from billion  or of consolidated operating revenues  for the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel reimbursements from major partners  increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel reimbursements was primarily due to a increase in asms  principally as a result of our increase in operating aircraft to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel reimbursements was less than the increase in asms  primarily due to operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
our total ground handling and other revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately from the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher volume of flights serviced under ground handling contracts with united and delta  whereby we perform ground handling services for ten other airlines 
cost per available seat mile 
our cost per asm decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the decrease in our cost of fuel per asm to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost per asm for fuel was primarily due to united purchasing fuel directly for our aircraft in certain locations as discussed above 
changes in the components of our other operating expenses are discussed in the table below 
the following table sets forth information regarding our operating expense components for the years ended december  and operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
individual expense components are also expressed as cents per asm 
amount percentage of revenue cents per asm amount percentage of revenue cents per asm in thousands in thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits  aircraft costs   maintenance   fuel   other airline expenses   interest   total airline expenses   salary wages and employee benefits 
the cost per asm for salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in number of employees was primarily due to the addition of personnel required to operate the additional aircraft we placed into service between december  and december   and related ground handling operations 
the decrease in the cost per asm for salaries  wages and employee benefits was primarily due to efficiencies obtained through operating larger aircraft over increased stage lengths 
aircraft costs 
the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of crjs and eight crjs between december  and december  crjs and crjs have lower ownership costs per asm than our existing crj and turboprop aircraft 
maintenance 
the cost per asm for maintenance expense increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the timing of engine overhaul events on aircraft operated under our delta connection agreements and other direct maintenance events during the year ended december  under our united express agreement and our midwest agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on regional jet engines that we record as revenue 
however  consistent with the direct expense maintenance policy  we record maintenance expense on our crj engines as it is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december   we collected and recorded as revenue million pretax under the united express agreement and midwest services agreement to compensate us for future engine maintenance overhauls 
because the maintenance category in the table above does not include salaries  wages and employee benefits associated with our maintenance operations those costs are included in the salary  wages and employee benefits line in the table above  the maintenance expense line in the above table differs from the maintenance line in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel 
the cost per asm for fuel decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  however  despite the increase in the average cost per gallon  during the year ended december   united purchased fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our aircraft operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver  which reduced our fuel costs and related passenger revenue compared to the year ended december  by approximately million 
other airline expenses 
the cost per asm for other airline expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
interest 
the cost per asm for interest expense decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of crjs between december  and december  crj s have lower ownership costs per asm than crj and turboprop fleets 
we also acquired ten crjs during the year ended december  under sublease arrangements with a major partner at nominal monthly amounts 
total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in total airline expense was primarily due the increase in asms which resulted principally from the increase in our fleet size and the increase in the average passenger trip length 
as a percentage of total operating revenues  total airline expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in total airline expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to increases in salaries  wages and benefits and maintenance costs as described above 
total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are substantially reimbursable by our major partners  increased approximately from the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the increase in our fleet size and the increase in the average passenger trip length 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased at a lower rate than asm growth  primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the increase in our net income was primarily due to the increase in our fleet size from to and associated increase in block hour production from to compared to operating statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the percentage of change for the years identified below 
year ended december  change revenue passenger miles   available seat miles   block hours   departures   passengers carried   passenger load factor pts passenger breakeven load factor pts yield per revenue passenger mile revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles our total asms generated during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  the increase in asms was primarily a result of increasing the size of our aircraft fleet  from aircraft as of december   to aircraft as of december  on september   the date we acquired asa  asa s fleet consisted of aircraft crjs  crjs and atrs 
additionally  during the year ended december   we took delivery of nine crjs  crj s and six crjs 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below 
operating revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a increase in asms 
revenue per asm was for the years ended december  and airline operating and interest expenses  excluding fuel charges  per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to billion for the year ended december   from billion  or of consolidated operating revenues  for the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel reimbursements from major partners  increased for the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel was primarily due to a increase in asms which resulted principally from the acquisition of asa in september and additional aircraft delivered in 
revenue per asm was for the years ended december  and passenger revenues include an amount designed to reimburse us for aircraft ownership costs 
the amount deemed to be rental income related to aircraft ownership costs for the year ended was million 
passenger load factor 
passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of our relationships with united and delta whereby skywest airlines and asa supplement mainline service in previously established and developed markets 
ground handling and other revenue 
total ground handling revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily related to additional cities skywest airlines was awarded ground handling contracts from our major partners  whereby  skywest airlines performs the ground handling for other regional airlines 
total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are substantially reimbursable by our major partners  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the acquisition of asa in september and additional aircraft delivered in 
airline operating and interest expenses  excluding fuel charges  per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
operating and interest expenses 
operating and interest expenses increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in total operating and interest expenses was due principally to the acquisition of asa in september and additional aircraft delivered in as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating and interest expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in operating and interest expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to significant increases in fuel costs year over year 
the following tables set forth information regarding our operating expense components for the years ended december  and operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
individual expense components are also expressed as cents per asm 
year ended december  amount percentage of revenue cents per asm amount percentage of revenue cents per asm in thousands in thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits  aircraft costs   maintenance   fuel   other airline expenses   interest   total airline expenses   the cost per asm of salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in number of employees was primarily due to the addition of personnel required for the new regional jet flying and due to the addition of personnel required for new cities added to our ground handling service contracts 
the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of asa s regional jet fleet and the addition of nine crjs and crj s  which have a lower operating cost per asm than crjs and our existing turboprop fleets 
the cost per asm for maintenance expense increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in the cost per asm was primarily attributed to timing of maintenance events associated with a higher average age of our crj and crj fleets 
the maintenance line in the table set forth above does not include salaries  wages and employee benefits associated with our maintenance operations those costs are included in the salary  wages and employee benefits line in the table 
accordingly  the amount for maintenance in the table above differs from the maintenance expense in our consolidated statements of income set forth in item below 
under the united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates charged to united for mature maintenance on regional jet engines that we record as revenue 
however  consistent with the direct expense maintenance policy  we record maintenance expense on our crj engines as it is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december   we collected and recorded as revenue million pretax under the united express agreement  with no material offset to crj engine maintenance overhauls 
the cost per asm for fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the average price of fuel increasing to per gallon during the year ended december   from per gallon for the year ended december  the cost per asm for other expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the operating efficiencies obtained from increased stage lengths flown by our regional jets 
interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the acquisition of asa s aircraft in september which are primarily financed with long term debt 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the increase was principally caused by cash generated from operations during the principal sources of cash during the year ended december  were million provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  million from returns on aircraft deposits and million from proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
we invested million in marketable securities  invested million in flight equipment  made principal payments on long term debt of million  repurchased million of outstanding shares of our common stock  invested million in buildings and ground equipment  paid million in cash dividends  invested million in other assets  and paid million in deposits for aircraft 
these factors resulted in a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  our position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in marketable securities was due primarily to cash generated from operations in that were invested in marketable securities 
at december   our total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  as of december   skywest airlines has a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility expires on march  and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million and million  respectively  as restricted cash  related to our workers compensation policies 
significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments    operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations principal maturities on long term debt   total commitments and obligations    purchase commitments and options on november   we announced that skywest airlines had been selected by delta to operate new crjs previously operated by comair inc ten of the crjs were delivered by december  and the remaining two crjs are scheduled to be delivered by june as of december   we had firm aircraft orders and commitments to operate two crj s to be subleased from delta 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment are estimated to be approximately million 
on october   we announced that skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which we intend to operate for united express  as part of an aircraft transition plan  allowing united express to remove emb seat turboprop aircraft from the contract reimbursement model in the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
generally  the turboprop removals are intended to occur in conjunction with deliveries of new regional jet aircraft in order to ensure a smooth transition in existing markets 
additionally  skywest airlines intends to exchange four seat crjs for four regional jet aircraft configured with seats in its delta connection operations 
on november   we announced that we placed a firm order for aircraft with bombardier aerospace 
we are scheduled to take delivery of these aircraft beginning in late and continue through the first quarter of total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations  are estimated to be approximately million through the first quarter of additionally  our agreement with bombardier includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
delivery dates for these aircraft remain subject to final determination as we agree upon with our major partners 
on january   we announced that skywest airlines has agreed to operate additional aircraft under the midwest services agreement 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment are estimated to be approximately million through the first quarter of skywest airlines has not historically funded a substantial portion of its aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  it has generally funded its aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing can not be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has financed aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to satisfy our firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as our acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for the committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  as part of our leveraged lease agreements  we typically agree to indemnify the equity owner participant against liabilities that may arise due to changes in benefits from tax ownership of the respective leased aircraft 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
long term debt obligations our total long term debt at december  was  million  of which  million related to the acquisition of brasilia turboprop  crj  crj and crj aircraft and million related to our corporate office building 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the brasilia turboprop and crj aircraft was approximately at december  guarantees skywest has guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the midwest airline services agreement and the obligations of asa under the asa delta connection agreement 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fin no 
as of january   and our management has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the periods subject to examination for our federal return are the through tax years 
the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our policy for recording interest and penalties on tax positions is to record such items as a component of the provision for income taxes 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
our management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel historically  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united and midwest have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted united express and midwest flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
we bear the economic fuel risk on our pro rate operations 
for the year ended december   contract flying and pro rate revenue flying represented approximately and  respectively  of our passenger revenues 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
because third parties bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on most of our flights  we believe that our results from operations will not be materially and adversely affected by fuel price volatility 
interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact our actual costs of acquiring these aircraft 
auction rate securities market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
as of december   we held approximately million of municipal notes with an auction reset feature 
as of february  auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on our remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed and as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
