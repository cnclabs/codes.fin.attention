item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review several events were significant for southwest during for example  southwest extended its string of consecutive profitable years to and consecutive profitable quarters to both of these marks are unmatched in the modern era of aviation results 
implemented a new customer boarding method for flights to significantly reduce the average time a customer spends waiting in line at the gate  while retaining the company s famous open seating policy once aboard the aircraft 
introduced a new fare structure including a business select product  which enables customers to be among the first to board the aircraft 
we also unveiled enhancements to our rapid rewards program 
began a significant gate re design to enhance the airport experience for customers  to be installed at virtually all airports served by the company 
grew the company s fleet by boeing aircraft to a total of s as of december  earned million on a cash basis  before profitsharing and income taxes from the expiration settlement of fuel derivative instruments the company had previously entered into to protect against jet fuel price increases 
incurred a one time million charge before profitsharing and income taxes related to an early retirement program that was offered by the company and accepted by more than employees during third quarter  as one of many efforts underway to improve the company s future profitability 
announced an expansion of our gds global distribution system and corporate travel account efforts through an agreement with travelport s galileo and worldspan 
recommenced service to san francisco international airport  with the highest initial concentration of flights of any new city in the company s history 
repurchased million shares of company common stock totaling billion through programs authorized by the company s board of directors 
although the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted exceeded its net income of million 
per share  diluted  the increase was entirely driven by certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods 
in fact  the company s operating income  which excludes these items  actually declined percent from to  primarily due to the significant increase in fuel costs  which the company was not able to recover through increased revenues 
the airline revenue environment was more difficult than the company envisioned coming into this was due to a slowing economy as well as continued competitive pressures from both new airlines as well as those that have significantly reduced their cost structures through the bankruptcy process or the threat of bankruptcy 
the company did raise fares several times during in an attempt to offset fuel cost pressures  however  these increases did not keep up with the rapidly increasing fuel prices 
looking ahead to  the company believes it has retained  and in some cases strengthened  its low cost competitive advantages as demonstrated by its protective fuel hedging position  excellent employees  and strong balance sheet 
these enable southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation and to favorable market opportunities in the face of an uncertain economy and record energy prices 
based on current and projected energy prices for and expected growth plans  the company believes net cash expenditures for jet fuel  which exclude certain fas gains and losses  could increase more than million compared to  even including the effects of fuel derivative contracts the company has in place as of january the company s fuel derivative contracts in place for provide protection for over percent of the company s expected jet fuel consumption at an average price of approximately per barrel of crude oil 
the company is also currently expecting a significant increase in its aircraft engine maintenance activity in the company will attempt to overcome the impact of higher anticipated fuel prices and other cost pressures through improved revenues and continued focus on non fuel costs 
based on this current outlook  southwest has reduced its previously planned growth rate for the company currently plans to grow its fleet by a net seven aircraft 
the company will add new aircraft from boeing  but plans to return from lease or sell a total of aircraft  resulting in a net available seat mile asm capacity 
table of contents increase of four to five percent 
for first quarter  the company s year over year capacity increase is expected to slightly exceed six percent 
based on current plans  the company s fleet is scheduled to total s by the end of results of operations compared with southwest s profit of million 
per share  diluted in was an increase of million  or percent  compared to the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted 
however  the company s net profit results in both and include certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with sfas  that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods 
these adjustments  which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives  are included in other gains losses  which is below the operating income line  in both periods 
in  these adjustments totaled net gains of million 
for  these adjustments totaled net losses of million 
therefore  southwest believes operating income provides a better indication of the company s financial performance for both and than does net income 
southwest s operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by a substantial increase in fuel expense  despite the fact that the company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program 
the company had instruments in place to protect against over percent of its fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of per barrel 
this resulted in a million reduction to fuel and oil expense during  although  even with this protection  the company s average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from in to in although fuel prices began at moderately high levels  they quickly increased and stayed at record levels throughout most of the second half of the year 
market crude oil prices flirted with per barrel several times during and market unhedged jet fuel prices reached as high as per gallon during the second half of the year 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to a million  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to an increase in capacity  as the company added aircraft and flights  resulting in a percent increase in available seat miles compared to the company purchased a total of new boeing aircraft during  and added another two leased s from a previous owner  resulting in the addition of aircraft for the year 
the company attempted to combat high fuel prices through modest fare increases 
however  general economic conditions as well as significant low fare competition made it difficult to raise fares as much as the company had done in the company s passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles increased percent compared to unit revenue total revenue divided by available seat miles also increased percent compared to levels  as a result of the higher rpm yield 
the company has been encouraged by more recent year over year unit revenue trends  which improved each month during fourth quarter the improved trends have continued thus far in first quarter because of the uncertainty surrounding our nation s overall economy  however  it is difficult for the company to precisely predict first quarter revenues 
consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent  versus a million  or percent  increase in freight revenues  resulting primarily from higher rates  was more than offset by a million decline in mail revenues 
the lower mail revenues were due to the company s decision to discontinue carrying mail for the us postal service effective as of the end of second quarter the company expects an increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter  primarily due to an increase in capacity and higher rates charged 
other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa card 
the company currently expects another increase in first quarter  also due to higher commissions earned  and at a somewhat comparable rate to the increase 

table of contents operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased million  or percent  compared to a percent increase in capacity 
historically  changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity  or asms 
the following presents southwest s operating expenses per asm for and followed by explanations of these changes on a per asm basis and or on a dollar basis in cents  except for percentages increase percent decrease change salaries  wages  and benefits fuel and oil maintenance materials and repairs aircraft rentals landing fees and other rentals depreciation and amortization other total the company s casm cost per available seat mile increased percent compared to approximately percent of this increase was solely due to the increase in fuel expense  net of gains from the company s fuel hedging program 
the remainder of the increase was due to higher maintenance expense 
all other operating expense categories combined to be approximately flat compared to due to higher fuel prices  the company has intensified its focus on controlling non fuel costs and continues to mitigate wage rate and benefit cost pressures through productivity and efficiency improvements 
the company s headcount per aircraft at december   was  versus a year ago level of from the end of to the end of  southwest s headcount per aircraft decreased percent  as the company implemented various technology improvements  which improved efficiency and enabled the company to grow capacity without a commensurate increase in headcount 
based on current cost trends  the company expects first quarter unit costs to increase from first quarter s cents  due primarily to a significant increase in fuel costs and the continuation of higher maintenance costs 
the higher expected fuel costs are due to the fact that the company s protective position as to fuel derivative instruments is not as favorable as first quarter  and current physical unhedged jet fuel prices are significantly higher than the prior year 
on an absolute dollar basis  salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  primarily from a million increase in salaries and wages  partially offset by a million decrease in benefits 
the dollar increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to a percent headcount increase  and the dollar decrease in benefits was due primarily to a million decrease in profitsharing  attributable to lower income available for profitsharing  and a million decrease in share based compensation  due to fewer employee stock options becoming vested during versus these benefits decreases were partially offset by higher healthcare costs 
although the company s net income was higher than  income available for profitsharing was lower  since the company s profitsharing plan does not consider the unrealized gains and or losses the company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of sfas salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm decreased percent compared to  primarily due to lower profitsharing expense and lower share based compensation expense  despite the increase in asms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sfas and fuel hedging  and note for further information on share based compensation 
based on current trends  the company expects salaries  wages  and benefits per asm in first quarter to be in line with first quarter s unit cost

both of these agreements become amendable in august the company s customer service and reservations agents are subject to an agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  afl cio  which becomes amendable in november fuel and oil expense increased million  and on a per asm basis increased percent versus approximately percent of the dollar increase was due to an increase in fuel prices  and the remainder was from an increase in gallons consumed to support the percent capacity increase versus on a per asm basis  nearly the entire increase was due to higher fuel prices 
the fuel derivative instruments the company held for were not as favorable as those held in the prior year  as they were at higher average crude oil equivalent prices than the instruments that settled expired in despite this  the company s hedging program resulted in the realization of million in cash settlements during these settlements generated a reduction to fuel and oil expense of million  compared to the prior year when the company s fuel derivative instruments resulted in a million reduction to fuel and oil expense 
even with these significant hedge positions in both years  the company s jet fuel cost per gallon increased percent versus the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was compared to in  excluding fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft  including the addition of blended winglets to all of the company s aircraft 
the company is also in the process of installing blended winglets on a significant number of its aircraft 
the company holds a significant fuel hedge position for  although for a lower percentage of forecasted consumption than in as of mid january  the company is nearly percent protected with fuel derivative instruments for its first quarter jet fuel requirements  at an average crude oil equivalent price of per barrel  and the majority of these positions effectively perform like option contracts allowing the company to benefit in most cases from energy price decreases 
during first quarter  market prices unhedged for jet fuel averaged per gallon  and the company had fuel derivatives in place to protect against nearly percent of its fuel usage at a crude oil equivalent price of per barrel 
january average market prices unhedged for jet fuel have been in the to range 
based on this difference in protection and current market conditions  the company expects its first quarter jet fuel cost per gallon to be approximately per gallon  excluding the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in sfas in addition  the company had fuel derivative contracts in place for over percent of its expected fuel consumption for the remainder of at approximately per barrel  over percent in at approximately per barrel  nearly percent in at approximately per barrel  over percent in at per barrel  and over percent in at per barrel 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent compared to  while increasing million on a dollar basis 
on a dollar basis  engine expense accounted for over percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for over percent of the increase 
with respect to airframe expense  the company completed significantly more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year 
these events  which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown  were higher in number as well as cost per event  and were also due to the ongoing transition to a new airframe maintenance program for and aircraft which began in in engine expense  there was a significant increase in repairs for the company s aircraft engines primarily due to the maturation of this fleet  which was introduced in  and more repair events than expected 
on a per asm basis  approximately percent of the increase in maintenance materials and repairs was a result of the higher airframe expense  and approximately percent of the increase was due to the higher engine expense 
in first quarter  the company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs per asm compared to first quarter and fourth quarter  due to higher engine expense for aircraft as well as continued higher airframe expense from the transition of aircraft to the company s new airframe maintenance program for and aircraft 
aircraft rentals expense per asm decreased percent and  on a dollar basis  decreased slightly 
the decrease per asm was due primarily to the fact that the company increased overall asms by percent  but the number of aircraft on operating lease increased by only two from to the company added 
table of contents purchased aircraft to its fleet during  and leased two additional aircraft 
the company currently expects similar year over year rental expense comparisons for first quarter landing fees and other rentals increased million on a dollar basis and percent on a per asm basis  compared to the dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in airport gate space to support the increase in capacity and trips flown versus on a per asm basis  the increase was due primarily to higher rates paid for airport space

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s future aircraft deliveries 
other operating expenses increased million but were flat on a per asm basis  compared to on a dollar basis  approximately percent of the increase was due to an increase in revenue related costs associated with the percent increase in passenger revenues such as credit card processing fees and approximately percent was due to higher personnel expenses which includes items associated with flight crew travel  such as hotel and per diem costs caused by the increase in capacity and trips flown 
excluding anticipated gains from the sale of aircraft  the company currently expects an increase in other operating expenses on a per asm basis for first quarter compared to first quarter  assuming increased revenues 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense decreased by million  or percent  primarily due to the company s repayment of million in debt during and this was partially offset by the issuance of million in new debt instruments in and  however  the timing of the new debt issued compared to the debt repaid resulted in lower expense for the company currently expects an increase in interest expense compared to  primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with recent borrowings in late and in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on long term debt transactions

the remainder of the passenger revenue increase was due primarily to the point increase in the company s load factor compared to the airline revenue environment changed significantly from the first half of to the second half of the year 
the company believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic economic factors  as well as the effects of the increased carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the terrorist plot uncovered by london authorities in august the airline revenue environment regained some momentum during late fourth quarter  and  despite growing capacity percent during the quarter  the company achieved a record load factor of percent at healthy yields  which resulted in a unit revenue growth rate of percent

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments

table of contents revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million  compared to million as of december  estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
holding other factors constant  a ten percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets for would have resulted in a million  or  change in passenger revenues recognized for that period 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
no material adjustments were recorded for years   or the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated residual estimated useful life value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 

table of contents subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices  and accounts for them under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas  the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
sfas requires that all derivatives be reflected at market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for year and beyond 
the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was billion  compared to million at december  the large increase in fair value was due primarily to the significant increase in energy prices in the second half of  net of the expiration ie  settlement of approximately million in fuel derivative instruments that related to and net of new derivative instruments the company added for future years 
of the remaining billion in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at december   approximately billion is expected to settle  or expire during changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically  as was evident during recent years  based on changes in the underlying commodity prices 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in recent years  
table of contents because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company s estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from actual results  resulting in increased volatility in the company s periodic financial results 
for example  historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for sfas hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges  as defined 
this historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether sfas hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the company uses in its hedging program 
during  based on these updates  the company in fact lost sfas hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments  and thus has marked all such derivatives to market value in each subsequent quarterly period since that time  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses in the consolidated statement of income 
although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases  there have been instances in which the company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities 
in these instances  the company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period 
although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for sfas hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
if recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future  the company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value of the company s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for protection 
the number of instances in which the company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  has increased recently  primarily due to these reasons 
in these cases  the company has determined the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting  as defined by sfas when this happens  any changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings in the period of change 
as the fair value of the company s hedge positions can fluctuate significantly in amount from period to period  it is probable there will be continued variability recorded in the income statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in future periods will be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes 
sfas is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements  including the documentation of a company hedging strategy  statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis  and strict contemporaneous 
table of contents documentation that is required at the time each hedge is designated by the company 
as required by sfas  the company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
the company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges  as required by sfas during first quarter  the company did revise its method for forecasting these future cash flows 
prior to  the company had estimated future cash flows using actual market forward prices of a single like commodity and adjusting for historical differences from the company s actual jet fuel purchase prices 
the company implemented an improved model for forecasting forward jet fuel prices during  due to the fact that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 
in accordance with sfas  the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this improved methodology for estimating future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices was applied prospectively  in accordance with the company s interpretation of sfas the company did not  however  change its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness 
as a result of this new method for forecasting future jet fuel prices  the company believes its hedges are more likely to be effective over the long term 
the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
the primary objective for the company s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
the company currently holds interest rate swap agreements related to its million senior unsecured notes due  its million senior unsecured notes due  its million senior unsecured notes due  and its million senior unsecured debentures due the interest rate swaps associated with the million notes and million debentures were entered into during the floating rate paid under the swap associated with the million senior unsecured notes due is set in arrears 
the company pays the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin every six months and receives percent every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid under this agreement during is estimated to be percent based on actual and forward rates at december  the floating rate for the swap agreement relating to its million senior unsecured notes due is set at the beginning of each six month period 
under this agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives percent every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid under this agreement during was percent 
for both the swap agreements associated with the million notes and million debentures  the company pays the libor plus a margin every six months on the notional amount of the debt  and receives the fixed stated rate of the notes or debentures every six months until the date the notes or debentures become due 
the average floating rate paid during under the agreement associated with the million notes due was percent 
the average floating rate paid during under the agreement associated with the million debentures due was percent 
the company s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and  thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  as necessary  with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt 
the total fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was an asset of approximately million 
the total fair value of the swap agreements held at december   was a liability of million 
the long term portion of these amounts is recorded in other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for each respective year 
in accordance with fair value hedging  the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices  would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
share based compensation the company has share based compensation plans covering the majority of its employee groups  including plans adopted via collective bargaining  a plan covering the company s board of directors  and plans related to employment contracts with the executive chairman of the company 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
however  prior to adoption of sfas r  share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified retrospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified retrospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
in addition  results for prior periods were retroactively adjusted utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior financial statements 
as part of this revision  the company recorded cumulative share based compensation expense of million for the period  resulting in a reduction to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  this adjustment  along with the creation of a net deferred income tax asset in the amount of million  resulted in an offsetting increase to capital in excess of par value in the amount of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the deferred tax asset represents the portion of the cumulative expense related to stock options that will result in a future tax deduction 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
for and  the company has relied on observations of historical volatility trends  implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties  and implied volatility from traded options on the company s stock 
for both and stock option grants  the company utilized expected volatility based on the expected life of the option  but within a range of percent to percent 
prior to  the company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for determining the estimated fair value of stock options 
in determining the expected term of the option grants  the company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics  the actual vesting schedule of the grant  and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used were actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
the expected dividend yield of the company s common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the company s current dividend yield  and adjusted for anticipated future changes 
vesting terms for the company s stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted 
for grants made to employees under collective bargaining plans  vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement 
for other employee plans  options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three  five  or ten years of continued 
table of contents employment  depending upon the grant type 
for grants in any of the company s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
none of the company s grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions  as defined 
as of december   the company had million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past grants of stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation cost was approximately eight years  however  the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years  in accordance with vesting provisions 
the majority of the million in share based compensation expense reflected in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   was related to options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
based on employee stock options expected to vest during  and the company s expectation of future grants  the company expects the expense related to share based compensation to once again decrease during compared to expense 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s derivative instruments 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were net assets of billion 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or billion  is classified as fuel derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or billion  is included in other assets 

table of contents the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations 
the credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
at december   the company had agreements with nine counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels 
at december   the company held billion in cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions 
these collateral deposits serve to decrease  but not totally eliminate  the credit risk associated with the company s hedging program 
the deposits are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  and the million senior unsecured debentures due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
excluding the notes or debentures that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company s only fixed rate senior unsecured notes at december  were its million notes due these senior unsecured notes have a fixed rate of percent  which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the company s outstanding million eetcs  which are secured by boeing aircraft  had an effective fixed rate of percent 
the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the twelve months ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled million  at december  however  the company generally does not retain the interest earnings on the billion in cash collateral deposits from counterparties associated with the company s fuel derivative instruments 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  auction rate securities  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest 
table of contents rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material affect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding cash collateral deposits  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement  the revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings 
for the revolving credit facility  the company must also maintain  at all times  a coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of not less than to 
the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written
