item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company  which from the commencement of operations in through  was focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
utilizing the cash flow generated by our higher margin gulf coast basin assets  and leveraging strong commodity prices  we have been able to accelerate our penetration into longer life basins in oklahoma  arkansas and texas through significantly increased and successful drilling activity and selective acquisitions 
specific asset diversification activities included the acquisition of proved reserves and acreage in the southeast carthage field in east texas 
in  we entered the arkoma basin in oklahoma by building an acreage position  drilling wells and acquiring proved reserves 
during and  we acquired additional acreage in oklahoma and texas  initiated an expanded drilling program in these areas  opened an exploration office in tulsa  oklahoma and divested several mature  high cost gulf of mexico fields 
during we continued to diversify into longer life regions by acquiring unevaluated leasehold interests in arkansas 
drilling operations targeting the fayetteville shale began on this acreage in september in addition  robust drilling activity continued in oklahoma and texas as we drilled gross wells in these regions during  realizing a success rate 
through these efforts  at december   of our estimated proved reserves were located in longer life basins as compared to at december  and at december  during  of our production was derived from longer life basins during the fourth quarter of versus and during and  respectively 
for the fourth consecutive year we achieved annual company records for production  estimated proved reserves  cash flow from operating activities and net income 
during we increased these operational and financial metrics by  
table of contents  and  respectively  from the previous record levels achieved during our record results over the last four years reflect our consistent drilling success and correlate directly with the implementation of our asset diversification strategy during comparing results with those in  we have grown production by and proved reserves by 
during  we invested million in exploratory  development and acquisition activities as we drilled gross wells realizing an overall success rate of 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
declines in prices or reserves could result in a future write down of oil and gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including 
table of contents changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute quantities that we are reasonably certain of recovering in future years 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counterparties to those contracts 
because the counterparties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a price at which they would be willing to settle such contracts as of the given date 
we believe the values provided by our counterparties represent the most accurate estimate of fair value of the contracts 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and accounting for income taxes and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption and december   we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the tax years from through remain open to examination by the tax jurisdictions to which we are subject

as a result of drilling success and the improvement in throughput from a new main field pipeline installed in late  production from ship shoal totaled bcfe  or approximately of total company production during  as compared to only bcfe during in addition  continued drilling success in oklahoma and texas resulted in increased production during from these basins 
the increase in production during was partially offset by the sale of several gulf of mexico fields in november production from the properties sold in totaled bcfe 
during the five year period ended december   we have realized a success rate on gross wells drilled 
assuming there are no material production shut ins during and we are able to maintain our historically high drilling success rates with our drilling program  we expect that our production will continue to increase during 
table of contents prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were higher as compared to the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  as compared to  during as a result of increased production volumes and higher realized prices 
assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we expect that our revenues would continue to increase as we expect to grow our production during through drilling 
during  gas gathering revenue and other income totaled  as compared to  during the increase in  as compared to  is the result of increased gas volumes being transported through the gas gathering systems 
expenses lease operating expenses during decreased to  as compared to  during lease operating costs in included  of costs related to the gulf of mexico properties sold in november we expect that operating expenses during will exceed amounts as a result of the expected increase in the number of producing wells in which we have an interest 
however  on a per unit basis  we expect that operating costs will generally approximate results 
production taxes increased to  during from  during the increase in production taxes is primarily due to increased production from our oklahoma  texas and onshore louisiana properties  partially offset by the reduction in the louisiana severance tax rate effective july  general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and was share based compensation expense relative to sfas r as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation excluding the impact of share based compensation expense  the resulting increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in our staffing during necessary to manage our increased operational activity

depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in the increase in dd a expense is the result of the growth in our oil and gas properties over the last three years from our significantly expanded drilling activity and several property acquisitions 
on an mcfe basis  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the increase in our dd a expense per mcfe is primarily due to increased costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves and the impact of six unsuccessful wells drilled in the gulf coast basin during assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we would expect the costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves to generally approximate levels 
during september and october  we issued a total of  shares of series b cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock the series b preferred stock

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the results were attributable to the following components production oil production during totaled  barrels  a increase from  while natural gas production increased to bcfe from gas production of bcfe 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
contributing to the increase in production during was the restoration of production at our main pass field in january and production attributable to the drilling success rates we achieved during each of and production from main pass accounted for of our total production for production gains during were offset by the shut in of the majority of production at our ship shoal block field during october and november due to work on the main field pipeline and the sale of certain mature gulf of mexico properties in november production from ship shoal block accounted for approximately of our total production during the nine months ended september  production during the third and fourth quarters of was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during  of our total production was natural gas as compared to during this shift towards natural gas is primarily the result of our expanded operations in texas and oklahoma where the production is primarily natural gas 
also contributing to the increase in gas as a percent of total production was the shut in of ship shoal discussed above 
ship shoal  which was brought back on line in december  produces a substantial portion of our total oil volumes

the increase in interest expense  as compared to  is primarily due to the impact of a full year of interest on our million senior notes due the notes during  which were issued during the second quarter of we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  during the increase is primarily due to the higher operating profit during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and sales of properties 
during september and october  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of our series b preferred stock 
the offering proceeds were primarily used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in order to provide liquidity for our ongoing diversification efforts 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a deficit of million at december  the decline in our working capital was primarily due to the million reduction in the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments  which is primarily the result of the expiration of several hedge contracts and higher estimated commodity prices  and the million increase in our accounts payable to vendors  net of cash and cash equivalents on hand  which is a result of increased operational activity 
we believe that our working capital balance should be viewed in conjunction with availability of borrowings under our bank credit facility when measuring liquidity 
as a result of the application of the net proceeds from the sale of our series b preferred stock  at december  we had no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility and million of borrowing capacity 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations increased from  during to  in the increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to our growth in production during source of capital debt during  we issued the notes  which have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on may and november at december   million had been accrued in connection with the may  interest payment 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the notes 

table of contents on november   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  petroquest energy  llc  entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow amounts based on the available borrowing base as determined in the credit facility 
the credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on november  the credit facility is secured by  among other things  a lien on at least of the pdp present value and at least of the aggregate proved reserves of our oil and gas properties 
pdp present value means the present value discounted at nine percent of the future net revenues attributable to producing reserves 
the borrowing base under the credit facility is based primarily upon the bi annual valuation of our mortgaged oil and gas properties 
the borrowing base is currently million and the next scheduled borrowing base re determination will be on april  and we or the lenders may request additional borrowing base re determinations 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants therein 
during january and february  we borrowed million under the credit facility to fund the acquisition of additional interests in our ft 
trinidad field and for other oil and gas activities 
outstanding balances on the credit facility bear interest at either the alternate base rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to based on borrowing base usage or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the alternate base rate is equal to the higher of the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  and the eurodollar rate is equal to the applicable british bankers association libor rate for deposits in us dollars 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility  including a maximum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to annualized consolidated ebitda  determined on a rolling four quarter basis of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility also includes customary restrictions with respect to liens  indebtedness  loans and investments  material changes in our business  asset sales or leases or transfers of assets  restricted payments such as distributions and dividends  mergers or consolidations  transactions with affiliates and rate management transactions 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  other than under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 
source of capital issuance of securities during september and october  we issued a total of  shares of series b preferred stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
cash dividends are payable quarterly in the amount of per share of series b preferred stock 
based on the total of  shares of series b preferred stock issued  the annual dividend payment  if declared and paid  is expected to be approximately million 
in january  we declared and paid our first dividend totaling million 
each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible at the holder s option at any time initially into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to adjustment  subject to our right to settle all or a portion of the conversion in cash 
on or after october   we may  at our option  cause the series b preferred stock to be automatically converted at the applicable conversion rate if the closing price of our common stock for trading days within a period of consecutive trading days equals or exceeds of the conversion price 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of certain terms of the series b preferred stock 
after giving effect to the issuance of the series b preferred stock  we have approximately million remaining under an effective universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 

table of contents source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continually evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects or in projects that have longer estimated lives 
during august  we announced that we were seeking strategic alternatives with respect to our gas gathering assets located in oklahoma 
one of those alternatives includes the potential sale of these assets during there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our assets 
use of capital exploration and development our capital budget  which excludes acquisitions and capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
based on our outlook of commodity prices and production  we believe that we will be able to fund our planned exploration and development activities with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings 
our future exploration and development activities  or any significant acquisitions  could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional bank borrowings  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay  reduce our participation in or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total senior notes purchase obligations operating leases capital projects total includes principal and interest 
consists of commitments for the rental of drilling rigs and seismic data acquisition obligations 
consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for equipment rentals 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our leased properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparts this 
table of contents difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received from the counterparties to our derivative instruments approximately million in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
as of december   we had entered into the following oil and gas hedge contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas costless collar  mmbtu crude oil costless collar bbls at december   we recognized a liability of approximately million related to the estimated fair value of these derivative instruments 
based on estimated future commodity prices as of december   we would realize a million loss  net of taxes  as a reduction to oil and gas sales during the next months 
these losses are expected to be reclassified based on the schedule of oil and gas volumes stipulated in the derivative contracts
