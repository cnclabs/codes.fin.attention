item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k include historical information and other information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and contain forward looking statements that involve risk  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the risk factors section of this report and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of clinical stage product candidates for central nervous system disorders  with exclusive worldwide commercial rights to three product candidates in clinical development for various central nervous system disorders 
our lead product candidate  fiapta tm iloperidone  is a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
on november  the united states food and drug administration fda accepted our new drug application nda for fiapta tm in schizophrenia 
our second product candidate  vec  is a compound for the treatment of sleep and mood disorders 
in november we announced positive top line results from our phase iii trial of vec in transient insomnia 
in november we initiated  and in february we completed  an enrollment in a phase iii trial of vec in chronic primary insomnia 
vec is also ready for phase ii trials for the treatment of depression 
our third product candidate  vsf  is a compound for the treatment of excessive sleepiness and is currently in a phase ii program 
we expect a decision from the fda on the nda for fiapta tm in schizophrenia on or about july   its pdufa action date  although the fda may not meet  or may extend  the pdufa action date 
we will have to conduct additional phase iii trials for vec in chronic sleep disorders prior to our filing of an nda for vec we will have to conduct additional phase ii trials for vsf in order to further its development 
assuming successful outcomes of our clinical trials and approval by the fda  we expect to commercialize fiapta tm and vsf with our own sales force in the us and through a partnership in non us markets  and expect to commercialize vec through a partnership with a global pharmaceutical company  although we have not yet identified such a global partner 
we are a development stage enterprise and have accumulated net losses of approximately million since the inception of our operations through december  we have no product revenues to date and have no approved products for sale 
since we began our operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our product candidates 
our future operating results will depend largely on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our lead product candidate  fiapta tm  and on the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of this report  entitled risk factors 
we completed our initial public offering in april the offering totaled  shares of common stock at a public offering price of  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million  after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions as well as offering expenses 
upon completion of the initial public offering  all shares of the company s series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
in january we completed our follow on offering  consisting of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 

table of contents based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs into the fourth quarter of if fiapta tm is approved by the fda on the expected pdufa action date of or about july   the company intends to pursue additional financing  in part to fund additional marketing and product launch costs 
the company believes that it would be able to raise sufficient capital to fund the product launch and operations into however  if the company cannot obtain additional financing  management has the ability and intent to implement a reduced spending plan to fund operations at least through the first quarter of in budgeting for our activities  we have relied on a number of assumptions  including assumptions that we will continue to expend funds in preparation of a commercial launch of fiapta tm  that we will conduct our phase iii trial of vec for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia in accordance with our expectations  that we will not engage in further in licensing activities  that we will not receive any proceeds from potential partnerships  that we will not expend funds on the bipolar indication for fiapta tm  that we will not conduct additional trials for the injectable formulation for fiapta tm  that we will not conduct additional trials for vsf  that we will continue to evaluate clinical and pre clinical compounds for potential development  that we will be able to continue the manufacturing of our product candidates at commercially reasonable prices  that we will be able to retain our key personnel  and that we will not incur any significant contingent liabilities 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect  if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than presently anticipated  or if we seek to acquire additional product candidates 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before they are needed if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
in our capital raising efforts  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a bank credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  if convertible  could result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available when we need it on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
the unavailability of financing may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for our research  development and marketing activities necessary to commercialize our potential biopharmaceutical products 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our research and development activities  we may not be able to continue operations or we may have to enter into collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than we currently intend 
collaborations that are consummated by us prior to proof of efficacy and safety of a product candidate could impair our ability to realize value from that product candidate 
in the absence of our ability to raise additional capital resources  we are prepared and have the ability to curtail the existing operating needs and commitments to have the operating funds through the first quarter of fiapta tm 
fiapta tm is our product candidate under development to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
we submitted an nda for fiapta tm for the treatment of schizophrenia to the fda on september  and on november  the fda accepted our nda 
we continue to work closely with the fda throughout their review process and anticipate a decision on our nda on its pdufa action date of or about july   although the fda may not meet  or may extend  the pdufa action date 
the application includes data from clinical trials and more than  patients treated with fiapta tm and also contains pharmacogenetic data aimed to further improve the benefit risk profile of fiapta tm in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia 
from inception to december  we incurred approximately million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of fiapta tm  including a million milestone license fee paid to novartis in upon the acceptance of our nda 
we expect to increase our pre launch commercial activities relating to fiapta tm  and we expect to start marketing fiapta tm commercially in early however  the time it takes to receive cash inflows from the sale of fiapta tm is highly dependent on facts and circumstances that we may not be able to control and are subject to a number of risks 
for example  delays in the approval process and subsequent commercial launch 
table of contents of fiapta tm following our filing may occur if the fda fails to attend to our filing in a timely manner or requires further data to approve fiapta tm 
please see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these and other risks 
we are also developing a week injectable formulation for fiapta tm  for which we already have early phase ii data from a study previously conducted by novartis 
we have completed essential manufacturing activities and intend to conduct additional clinical trials following fda approval of the oral dose formulation for fiapta tm 
vec vec is our product candidate under development to treat sleep and mood disorders 
vec is a melatonin receptor agonist that works by adjusting the human body clock of circadian rhythm 
vec has successfully completed a phase iii trial for the treatment of transient insomnia in november in november we initiated and in february completed an enrollment in a phase iii trial of vec to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vec in chronic primary insomnia 
the trial is a randomized  double blind  and placebo controlled study with patients 
the trial measures time to fall asleep and sleep maintenance  as well as next day performance 
we expect to complete the study and to report its top line results in june we will have to conduct additional trials prior to our filing of an nda for vec to treat sleep disorders 
vec is also ready for phase ii trials for the treatment of depression 
from inception to december   we incurred approximately million in direct research and development costs directly attributable to our development of vec  including a million milestone license fee paid to bms in upon the initiation of our phase iii program 
vsf vsf is an oral compound that has demonstrated effects on animal sleep wake patterns and gene expression suggestive of a stimulant effect 
in a recently completed phase ii trial of vsf in excessive sleepiness  the compound demonstrated improvement compared to placebo on the maintenance of wakefulness test mwt  though not statistically significant  and dose dependent  statistically significant improvements versus placebo on a number of secondary endpoints taken in the recovery sleep period after dosing  including number of awakenings  and sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset in the first third of the recovery sleep period 
vsf was also demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated 
we will have to conduct additional phase ii trials of vsf in order to further its development 
excessive sleepiness is a common symptom that can significantly impair a person s ability to function 
the effects of excessive sleepiness range from mild sleepiness to unrecognized episodes of microsleeps and uncontrollable sleep attacks 
excessive sleepiness is a symptom of many disorders  including obstructive sleep apnea  narcolepsy  shift worker sleep disorder  parkinson s disease and alzheimer s disease 
from inception to december   we incurred approximately million in direct research and development costs directly attributable to our development of vsf  including a milestone license fee of million paid to novartis upon the initiation of our first phase ii clinical trial in march of revenues 
we generated some revenue during the period from march  inception to december  and during the year ended december  under research and development contracts that were derived principally from consulting agreements we entered into during our start up phase to defray research costs 
we completed our obligations during those periods under these agreements and no longer seek such arrangements 
we have not generated any other operating revenue since our inception 
any revenue that we may receive in the near future is expected to consist primarily of license fees  milestone payments and research and development reimbursement payments to be received from potential partners 
if our development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we could generate revenue from sales of our products and from receipt of royalties on sales of licensed products 
research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to third party professional service providers in connection with the services they provide for our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  all related facilities costs  and salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expenses related to our research and development 
table of contents personnel 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
from inception through december   we incurred research and development expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
we also expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we continue our efforts to develop our product candidates and to evaluate potential in license product candidates 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the period from march  inception to december  and for the years ended december  to december  and for the period from march  inception to december  included in the following table are the research and development expenses recognized in connection with our product candidates in clinical development 
included in other product candidates are the costs directly related to research initiatives for all other product candidates

we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
in  there were no active development programs in process for our product candidates listed in the table 
in  all facility related costs were allocated to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation  serving executive  finance  accounting  information technology  marketing and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and fees for legal  accounting and other professional services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we support our discovery and research development efforts  for our commercial development activities and fulfill our reporting and other regulatory obligations applicable to public companies 
from inception through 
table of contents december   we incurred general and administrative expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
beneficial conversion feature 
in september we completed the sale of an additional  shares of series b preferred stock for proceeds of approximately million 
after evaluating the fair value of our common stock obtainable upon conversion by the stockholders  we determined that the issuance of the series b preferred stock sold in september resulted in a beneficial conversion feature calculated in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  as interpreted by eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  of approximately million which was fully accreted in september and is recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders for the year ended december  likewise  in december  we completed the sale of an additional  shares of series b preferred stock for additional proceeds of approximately million 
after evaluating the fair value of our common stock obtainable upon conversion by the stockholders  we determined that the issuance of the series b preferred stock sold in december resulted in a beneficial conversion feature calculated in accordance with eitf issue no 
 as interpreted by eitf issue no 
 approximately million of which was fully accreted in december and is recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders for the year ended december  interest and other income  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment debt 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and we have accordingly included them in this discussion 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
the estimation of accrued expenses involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements 
accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as those under contracts with clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  and fees for marketing and other commercialization activities 
pursuant to our assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize these expenses as the services are provided 
our assessments include  but are not limited to an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  analyses of data that justify the progress  and management s judgment 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
stock based compensation 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method of implementation and adopted the accelerated attribution method 
prior to january  we followed apb 
table of contents opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable entities and other factors due to the lack of historic information of the company s publicly traded common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on the transition approach provided by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
as the options meet the plain vanilla criteria required by this method 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not paid dividends to our stockholders since the inception and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock based compensation expense for a period is also affected by expected forfeiture rate for the respective option grants 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments or expected forfeitures are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
total stock based compensation expense  related to all of the company s stock based awards  recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and  under apb for the year ended december   and recognized for the period from march  inception to december   was comprised of the following period from march  inception to year ended december  december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas outlines a common definition of fair value and the new standard intends to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
we will need to adopt sfas for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb agreed to delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  this pronouncement is not expected to have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
according to this standard the entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis the fair value option 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this pronouncement is not expected to have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf  which provides guidance to research and development companies on how to account for the nonrefundable portion of an advance payment made for research and development activities 
we will be required to adopt eitf for the year beginning after december  this pronouncement is not expected to have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations and sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas r and sfas will be applied to acquisitions that close in years beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
these pronouncements are not expected to have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb ratified eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the consensus prohibits the equity method of accounting for collaborative arrangements under apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  unless a legal entity exists 
payments between the collaborative partners will be evaluated and reported in the income statement based on applicable gaap 
absent specific gaap  the participants to the arrangement will apply other existing gaap by analogy or apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy consistently 
the guidance in eitf is effective for periods that begin after december  and will apply to arrangements in existence as of the effective date 
the effect of the new consensus will be accounted for as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including any possible payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  and the timing and outcome of clinical trials and related possible regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses may be incurred at increasing rates

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange we currently incur a portion of our operating expenses in currencies other than us dollars  the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements  and we have determined that such operating expenses have not been significant to date 
as a result  we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates and do not expect to be impacted materially for the foreseeable future 
however  if operating expenses incurred outside of the united states increase  our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
we do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future 
interest rates our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments 

table of contents effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
marketable securities we deposit our cash with financial institutions that we consider to be of high credit quality and purchase marketable securities which are generally investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k
