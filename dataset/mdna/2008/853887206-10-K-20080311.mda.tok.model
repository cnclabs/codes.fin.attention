item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts this management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the caption risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
references to   and refer to the week periods ended december   december   and january  overview the company we are a leading document services provider that helps our customers manage  control  and source their document and print related spending 
we primarily serve the healthcare  financial services  and manufacturing industries 
we are trusted by our customers to manage business critical documents 
our strategy is to help migrate companies from paper based to digital processes by providing products and services including printed products  pressure sensitive labels  print on demand services  document automation  outsourcing  and professional services 
our enterprise document management approach includes analysis of where  how  and even if documents should be printed 
this document study includes everything from forms  stationery  reports to marketing collateral addressing what is printed internally  as well as externally 
we provide customers the tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery  allowing them to reduce document related costs 
we make a measurable difference for our customers by helping them achieve their desired business outcomes by assisting them with reducing costs  transitioning to more efficient processes  effectively managing their risks and meeting their regulatory and industry requirements  and driving their business growth 
our operations include five reportable segments document management  label solutions  print on demand pod services  document systems  and pathforward 
our business challenges we are engaged in an industry undergoing fundamental change 
digital technology is  as is almost always the case with any disruptive change  both friend and foe 
our traditional business documents are essential for the conduct of business  but many are being replaced or devalued by software 
on the other hand  digital technology introduces new opportunities  such as print on demand services  for those willing to invest 
our company s history is one of adapting to change  and our goal is to persevere and grow in the digital age 
the cost reduction program described below was a necessary step for the company to address these challenges and achieve its long term objectives 
in  we initiated restructuring actions as part of an overall plan to reduce our annual operating costs by million 
on july   we eliminated approximately positions  primarily in management and overhead  representing million annually in compensation and related costs 
earlier in the year  we consolidated our manufacturing and warehousing operations in a move expected to save approximately million annually 
other new initiatives that target purchasing costs and other non compensation expenditures are expected to lower costs by an additional million annually 
we targeted approximately million of savings in with the remaining balance expected in our pension plan became underfunded in late  primarily as a result of lower interest rates and weak stock market returns in and the amortization of these and other actuarial losses has resulted in significant expense in subsequent years equivalent to per share in  per share in  and per share in we have continued to make voluntary cash contributions to our qualified pension plan  averaging million annually over the last six years 
we made million of voluntary contributions in the market for many of our traditional printed products is very price competitive 
it is likely that the increasing use of reverse auctions and other bidding tools will gain in popularity and may lower the prices of our printed products 
paper mill operating rates for uncoated freesheet were in the to range at the end of during  operating rates were reported in the to range 
paper mills are expected to manage supply chain capacity as they are faced with higher energy and transportation costs 
the industry continues to remove capacity through downtime and closures  and mill operating rates for are projected to be as high as 
at the time of this writing  a price increase on bond roll product and xerographic cut sheet has been announced for the first quarter of in the six to seven percent range 
we plan to increase our selling prices and negotiate with customers to recover these increases as well as any additional increases 
despite a competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through these paper cost increases  although it often takes several quarters due to the custom nature of our products and our contractual relationships with many of our customers 
our focus our objective is to continue to improve the sales trend in our core document business by obtaining market share in targeted accounts and vertical markets where we have a strong reputation and value proposition 
we will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive 
we plan to address the large and growing market to provide for digital print on demand output  including color and variable print 
services that provide the customer with added convenience  design capability and control over the process are expected to be a strong differentiator 
we plan to step up the level of investment in our pod services business in order to ensure that we catch the building market momentum in this important growth segment 
this will translate into higher capital expenditures and selling  general and administrative expenses in the coming quarters 
we intend to continue to bring our customers products and services that improve their ability to capture  manage  and move information in their business processes 
we also offer a portfolio of standard register managed services that help our customers reduce costs and improve their business processes  allowing them to concentrate on their core competencies 
over time  services will become an increasing source of our revenue stream 
our strategy is beginning to resonate with customers  and we have successfully completed implementation of these offerings 
we expect to continue to focus on generating positive cash flow and maintaining our current strong financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
with the exception of contingent liabilities  the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below generally do not affect segment results  however  share based compensation expense is reflected in segment results through an allocation of corporate expenses 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension and postretirement obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the rate of future compensation increases  and the healthcare cost trend rate 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension or postretirement oblig ations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation and certain components of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit costs is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension and postretirement healthcare benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long ter m investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and could continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our nonqualifed pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost 
rate of future compensation increases the rate of anticipated future compensation increases is another significant assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting and is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
healthcare cost trend rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation for our postretirement healthcare plan is the healthcare cost trend rate 
we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates used 
we review the assumptions used to account for pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations and benefit cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate used for pension obligations discount rate used for postretirement healthcare obligation future compensation increase rate used for pension obligation current year subsequent years current year healthcare cost trend rate used for postretirement healthcare obligation holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the postretirement obligation recorded by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the future compensation increase rate would increase or decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a increase in the current year healthcare cost trend rate would increase the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation recorded by approximately million  and a decrease would reduce the obligation by million 
net periodic pension benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease pension cost by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase pension cost by approximately million 
a change in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on the postretirement benefit cost 
a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase pension benefit cost by million 
amortization of differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets  including those resulting from losses in and  impacts our pension cost 
the long term rate of return on plan assets that we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  the same as the amortization of past market losses and other actuarial losses is expected to be lower in and subsequent years 
while the exact amount is not known at this time  we estimate that the amortization will decrease in by approximately million 
the decrease is primarily the result of the settlement and curtailment that occurred in that reduced the unamortized actuarial losses to be recognized in future years 
as a result of associates retiring in and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit from the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plan  we recorded non cash settlement charges of million in net periodic benefit cost 
a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial net losses equal to the percentage reduction in the pension benefit obligation 
the settlements reduced our projected benefit obligation by million and our pension assets by million 
restructuring actions undertaken in resulted in a reduction of associates who participated in our qualified defined benefit pension plan 
as a result  we experienced a curtailment that reduced our projected benefit obligation by million 
fair value measurements we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include intangible assets  goodwill  and plant and equipment  whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to sustained underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results changes in the manner of use of the assets  their physical condition  or the strategy for the company s overall business negative industry or economic trends a more likely than not expectation that a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset 
when we determine that the carrying amount of plant and equipment or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable  based on the existence of one or more indicators  the assets are tested for impairment 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment assessments are performed using fair value techniques 
we follow a process that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition  or market comparisons 
these valuation techniques use significant estimates and assumptions  which include projected future cash flows  discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows  growth rates  and determination of appropriate market values 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in a different conclusion on whether an asset was impaired or the amount of the impairment charge recorded 
goodwill during the second quarters of and  we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill 
the test was performed at the reporting unit level using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
based upon the test results  we determined that the discounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets exceeded the carrying value of those assets  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
in performing the test for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability that required significant judgment 
in estimating expected future cash flows for the test  we used internal forecasts that were based upon actual results  assuming slightly increasing revenue and gross margin improvement 
at the time of the impairment test  the carrying value of net assets for the reporting unit associated with the goodwill was million 
the most critical estimates used in determining the expected future cash flows were the revenue and cost assumptions and the terminal value assumed 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or if either of these two assumptions changed by  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans  tax planning strategies  and other expectations about future outcomes 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
valuation allowances our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we have established valuation allowances for us and canadian capital loss carryforwards that we believe will not be utilized before the expiration period 
should future taxable income be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
unrecognized tax benefits effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that the financial statement effects of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
the cumulative effect of applying fin was million and was recorded as an adjustment to the january  balance of retained earnings 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we have recorded a liability of million that represents tax benefits taken in our tax returns  but not yet reflected in our tax provision because of the uncertainty of the position 
if we are ultimately successful  this liability would be reversed and the tax benefits would be recognized 
this would favorably affect the effective income tax rate of a future period or periods 
inventories substantially all inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are stated using the last in  first out lifo dollar value method 
we subcontract  store  and later distribute finished goods to fulfill certain customer orders 
such subcontracted finished goods inventories are recorded at cost on a first in  first out fifo basis and amounts related to such subcontracted finished goods inventories are excluded from our lifo calculation 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of our estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or the lifo reserve  was approximately 
million and million at december  and december  under the dollar value lifo method  similar items of inventory are aggregated to form inventory pools 
increases and decreases in a pool are identified and measured in terms of the total dollar value not the quantity of physical items of inventory in the pool 
the use of indices is an integral part of the dollar value lifo method 
using the link chain technique  a cumulative index is used to convert deflate year end inventories priced at current cost to base year cost and to convert inflate an increment stated at base year cost back to lifo cost 
under both techniques  indices are developed by pricing all inventory items twice 
in other words  inventory quantities on hand at the end of the current year are priced at current year current costs and at prior year current costs 
this ratio of costs is then used to adjust the cumulative index at the end of the preceding year to a new cumulative index 
the t otal current cost of current year end inventories is next converted to total base year cost by means of the new cumulative index 
the net change in inventory is then determined by comparing the total inventory at base year cost at the beginning and the end of the current year 
lifo values are determined  by layer  by applying the applicable cumulative index to the increments stated at base year cost 
we evaluate the lifo calculation each quarter and record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our inventories and product mix and our merchandise mix 
we believe the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics producer price indices or other published indices 
should actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances at the end of any fiscal year differ materially from our interim estimates  changes could occur that would materially affect our consolidated statement of income for that year 
at december   a increase in our cumulative index would have increased our lifo expense approximately million  or approximately million after tax 
conversely  a decrease in our cumulative index would have decreased our lifo expense by approximately million  or approximately million after tax 
share based compensation expense determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
additionally  the share based compensation expense that is recorded is dependent on the amount of awards we expect to be forfeited 
if our actual forfeitures are materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we also issued shares of performance based restricted stock that would only vest upon attainment of specific performance goals by the company 
this required us to assess the probability of meeting the performance goal when determining the amount and timing of the compensation expense to record 
in we had shares of performance based restricted stock which would have vested upon attainment of a performance goal by the company by the end of we evaluated the probability of meeting this performance goal each quarter and continued to expect the full amount to vest in  therefore  we did not reduce compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
however  the performance goal was not met by the end of and  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of expense that had previously been recorded in   and the first nine months of contingent liabilities the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and is party to environmental actions that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts and is reviewed periodically 
actual expenses incurred in future periods may vary from current estimates  given the inherent uncertainties in estimating the extent of necessary remediation efforts 
the company has participated with other potentially responsible parties prps in the investigation  study  and remediation of the pasco sanitary landfill superfund site the pasco site in eastern washington state since the company is a member of a prp group known as the industrial waste area generators group ii the iwag group 
in  the iwag group and several other prp groups entered into agreed orders with the department of ecology for implementation of interim remedial actions and expansion of groundwater monitoring 
the department has recently required the prp groups to implement additional interim actions and delay implementation of a final remedy 
this regulatory development has caused an increase in the projected expenses associated with the pasco site through the interim and final remedy stages 
we have a discounted reserve of million that we currently believe is adequate to cover the company s portion of the total future potential costs of remediation 
in addition  we have undiscounted reserves totaling million for environmental remediation at one previously owned facility and one currently owned facility 
the final remediation amounts could differ from our current estimate 
results of operations discontinued operations in april  we sold selected assets of our digital writing business  including inventory  equipment  and prepaid assets  to exped llc  for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the transaction resulted in a net gain of approximately million 
in june  we sold of the outstanding capital stock of insystems corporation insystems to whitehill technologies  inc  for million in cash  plus the return of certain cash deposits the transaction resulted in a net loss of approximately million which included a charge of million for contractual obligations to whitehill technologies  inc  related to the leased facility 
in conjunction with the recording of this contractual obligation  we reversed a restructuring liability of million to discontinued operations 
the digital solutions and insystems businesses were sold because they no longer fit with the company s strategic direction 
the sale of digital solutions and insystems  both reportable segments  met the criteria to be accounted for as discontinued operations under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the results of operations for digital solutions and insystems have been excluded from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
cash flows related to discontinued operations are not separately disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows

the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
restructuring in  we announced plans to reduce our annual operating costs by million 
the restructuring actions were undertaken in order to improve profitability  maintain competitiveness  and fund future initiatives essential to the company s strategy 
at the close of  we estimate that we reduced second half costs by approximately million in comparison to the first half as a result of these programs  exceeding our goal of million 
on an annualized basis  this represented million of the million plan 
programs are underway to achieve the balance of the goal 
we recorded million  million  and million of restructuring charges in   and related to these savings initiatives as well as other restructuring actions described in further detail under restructuring and asset impairment 
pension loss amortization and pension settlements our qualified pension plan became underfunded in primarily as a result of the weak stock market in and and subsequent declines in interest rates 
this produced actuarial losses that are amortized to expense subsequent years 
pension loss amortization was million  million  and million  in   and the amortization is expected to be lower in and to continue to trend lower thereafter 
while the exact amount is not known at this time  we estimate that the amortization will decrease in by approximately million as a result of the settlement and curtailment that occurred in which reduced the balance of unamortized actuarial losses 
as a result of associates retiring and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit we recorded non cash settlement charges of million and million in net periodic benefit cost for and a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial net losses 
pension loss amortization and settlement charges are non cash expenses 
consolidated summary management evaluates the company s results and those of its segments on the basis of income from continuing operations excluding restructuring charges  asset impairments  pension loss amortization  and pension settlements  referred to as adjusted operating income 
we believe that this non gaap financial measure enhances the understanding of our results of operations due to the non operational nature of the excluded items and the significant and varying effect they have on our reported results from period to period 
this presentation is consistent with the manner in which our board of directors establishes incentives and internally evaluates performance 
this non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
adjusted operating income was relatively consistent over the last three years million  million  and million in   and in  revenue was up million overall and the gross margin increased by million 
these improvements were driven by performance gains in our pod services segment  which overcame the effects of lower document management revenue 
depreciation and amortization was also favorable in  down million  but sg a expense was up million over the prior year as a result of higher spending on selling and information technology initiatives 
adjusted operating income in decreased million 
in  revenue was down million from the prior year 
three customers accounted for a total of million in revenue decreases 
these included the loss of label business at a large pharmacy  price cuts at a major bank  and a reduction in prescription pad sales representing the difference between the initial program rollout in and a much lower maintenance level in the gross margin in was down million  reflecting the lower revenue and temporarily higher costs incurred in conjunction with the plant consolidation undertaken as part of the company s cost reduction program 
largely as a result of the cost reduction program  the second half of adjusted operating income was million higher than that for the first half of the year 
total adjusted operating income exceeded the prior year by million

segments the actual cost of sales and depreciation are recorded for each segment and a selling  general and administrative expense sg a allocation is made based on an evaluation of each segment s utilization of our selling  support  and engineering resources 
in  the company analyzed its internal reporting structure 
as part of this process  we evaluated the impact on segment reporting  and in the fourth quarter  made changes to our reportable segments 
a summary of the changes is as follows the document and labels solutions segment was separated into two reportable segments document management and label solutions 
the commercial print and international business units  which were previously reported in the other reportable segment  are now included in the document management segment 
freight revenue billed to customers and freight costs paid to vendors previously were accounted for as a separate business unit and reported with the document and labels solutions reportable segment 
freight revenue and freight costs are now associated with their respective products and reported with the applicable reportable segment 
certain outsourced products were moved from the pod services segment to business units in the document management segment 
print management services were moved from commercial print to pathforward 
the digital solutions segment was sold in a complete description of our reportable segments is included in item  business 
segment information for and has been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the current presentation 
document management rev rev rev revenue change gross margin operating income our document management segment operates in a market generally characterized by excess capacity and price competition 
despite these conditions  pricing overall was up slightly in both years in response to higher paper costs 
despite the slightly higher selling prices  document management revenue was down in and in  reflecting unit shipment decreases of approximately and in those same years 
the gross margin percentage declined steadily over the three year period from in to in to in this pattern reflects the combination of lower unit sales  competitive pricing  and temporarily higher costs related to the plant consolidation 
costs improved significantly in the second half of as the benefit of the cost reduction program began to be realized 
the gross margin for the second half of was versus for the first half 
despite the million decrease in gross margin  operating profit was down only million as a result of lower sg a expenses to allocate to the segments and lower depreciation 
label solutions rev rev rev revenue change gross margin operating income the label industry also competes on price  but the company attempts to differentiate itself by offering highly value added solutions 
gross margins tend to be higher than for traditional printed products 
label solutions revenue increased modestly in  but declined million or in the drop in revenue was primarily attributed to an million revenue decrease at a single pharmacy account that changed the manner in which it labeled its prescription bottles 
pricing in this segment was modestly higher in both and as a result of the company s effort to recover higher material costs 
excluding the single pharmacy account decrease in  unit sales were nearly identical in each of the three years 
the gross margin increased million in on higher revenue  but declined million in primarily as a result of the large pharmacy account loss and start up costs at our mexico label plant 
the gross margin percentage has improved modestly in each year to in  to in  and to in these gross margin percentages were helped by the closing of our terre haute label plant and consolidation of its production capacity into other facilities 
the operating profit improvement of million in reflects the increase in that year s gross margin 
the million decrease in the operating income reflects the million drop in gross margin  offset by the reduced level of sg a expense allocation 
pod services rev rev rev revenue change gross margin operating income our pod services segment provides short run offset and digitally printed products plus a variety of related services 
short run offset products declined in and in  reflecting decreasing demand and a preference for digital print 
offset products represented about of this segment in digital print increased in and was up in the company rolled out a large state wide secure prescription pad program in and continued to supply the pads in  although at a lower maintenance level 
excluding revenue from prescription pads in both years  digital print revenue increased and in and overall  revenue was up in and down in average selling prices were modestly higher in both years  reflecting the pass through of higher paper costs 
service revenue has grown by over the last two years  reflecting the company s push in recent years to earn a return on the many services offered by this segment 
services represented about of total revenue in the gross margin increased million in as a result of increased revenue and cost improvements 
gross margin declined million in  reflecting the decrease in revenue offset in major part by cost improvements 
the gross margin percentage increased in each year from in  to in  to in productivity improvements  cost saving initiatives  and the growth in service revenue all played a role in this improvement 
the million increase in operating income is closely correlated to the million rise in the gross margin 
in  the operating profit increased million despite the lower gross margin  reflecting the reduced level of sg a expense allocation 
document systems rev rev rev revenue change gross margin operating income document systems sells application software and services that facilitate the secure  on demand printing of business documents 
document systems also generates revenue from the sale of related hardware equipment such as printers 
total revenue increased modestly in each of the last two years up in to million  and up in to million 
this segment s strategy has been to focus primarily on application software and services  these revenue components accounted for approximately half of revenue  compared to one fourth in the gross margin in was million  little changed from the million result in the gross margin percentages were in compared to in the prior year 
the gross margin was million or of revenue 
pathforward rev rev rev revenue change gross margin operating loss pathforward provides consulting and commercial print management services 
this segment also markets software that enables a company to manage the cost and utilization of its fleet of desktop printers  copiers  and fax machines 
revenue was and million in and  but increased significantly in to million 
this increase was the result of growth in commercial print outsourcing and the initial installation of the fleet management software acquired earlier in the year 
this segment has reported operating losses in each year 
the gross margin improved in to  but start up costs related to the fleet management software were also high  producing the loss of million 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as shown in the table below  excluding pension amortization and settlements  sg a expense decreased by million in  following an increase of million in total selling  general and administrative expense amortization of pension net acturial losses pension settlements selling  general and administrative expense  excluding the above the decrease in reflects lower compensation as a result of the restructuring  lower healthcare costs  and lower share based compensation expense 
because performance goals were not met  in we reversed approximately million of expense recorded in and related to performance based restricted stock 
in addition  approximately million of non recurring items  primarily related to sales tax refunds  reduced sg a expense 
the primary contributors to the increase were sales compensation  fringe costs  and increased information technology spending  offset by a million reversal of expense related to a favorable audit settlement for unclaimed funds 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization continued to trend lower in million compared with million and million in the two preceding years 
the decrease reflects the lower level of capital spending in recent years as the company has adopted an asset lighter strategy 
annual capital spending has been in the million range over the last several years  compared with much higher amounts prior to in addition  plant consolidations undertaken in recent years have had the effect of reducing excess capacity and equipment depreciation 
capital expenditures in are estimated in the million range 
restructuring and asset impairment pre tax components of restructuring charges consist of the following restructuring actions restructuring actions restructuring actions total restructuring charges restructuring in  we initiated restructuring actions as part of an overall plan to reduce our annual operating costs 
we ceased production and closed our facility in middlebury  vermont 
equipment and production was transferred to three other existing plants 
we recorded million of restructuring costs in the document management segment related to the closing of the middlebury plant  million for employer related costs and million of other associated exit costs  primarily for equipment removal and relocation  employee relocation  and inventory write offs 
we also eliminated approximately positions  primarily in management and overhead  representing million annually in compensation and related costs 
total restructuring costs were million for severance and employer related costs 
pre tax components of restructuring charges consist of the following total costs cumulative expected to date to be restructuring incurred expense severance and employer related costs associated costs total by segment document management label solutions pod services other total a summary of the restructuring accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred balance accrual in severance and employer related costs total restructuring within the label solutions segment  we closed our terre haute  indiana label production plant 
the plant s production capacity was transferred to three other existing plants to improve overall efficiency and lower operating costs 
total costs incurred included million for severance and employer related costs and million for other directly associated costs  primarily equipment removal and relocation 
restructuring in  we closed one printing center within the pod services segment  moving production to other facilities and outsourcing envelope production 
we also closed a warehouse in the document management segment 
total costs incurred were primarily severance and employer related costs 
the remaining restructuring expense in and was primarily related to vacated facilities from prior restructurings that we were unable to sublease 
the expense in was offset by a reversal of million for lower than expected severance and healthcare benefits for certain associates  primarily due to the reversal of an accrual established for severance related to its outsourcing of information technology operations in we had agreed to pay severance to associates whose positions were subsequently eliminated  and the number of positions eliminated was less than expected 
asset impairments during  we recorded million of asset impairments  primarily for software that was replaced during the year 
in conjunction with the closing of the terre haute plant  in we recorded million of asset impairments  primarily related to equipment 
the carrying value of the terre haute building and equipment was adjusted to its fair value less costs to sell  considering recent sales of similar properties and real estate valuations 
other equipment was determined to have no fair value and was disposed 
at december   the terre haute building was classified as held for sale and subsequently sold in january at a small gain 
at the end of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a document management plant would be closed which caused us to perform an impairment test on the long lived assets 
this resulted in the company recording an asset impairment charge of million to adjust the carrying values of building and equipment assets to their fair value less costs to sell  considering the most recent information available including recent sales of similar properties 
other equipment was determined to have no fair value and was disposed 
in  we closed document management s middlebury plant 
the market was stronger than expected  and we received several offers in for the purchase of the building that were higher than originally anticipated 
as a result  in  we reversed the million impairment charge recorded in associated with the building 
in july  the middlebury facility was sold at a gain of approximately million 
we also reversed million of the impairment charge recorded in related to the sale and disposal of equipment 
we transferred more equipment to other existing plants than originally expected 
an additional million of impairment charges were recorded for other equipment  primarily in the document management segment 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in  compared with million and million in and the increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances carried during income taxes the effective tax rates were   and  for   and the table below details the major items that impacted the rates in each of the years 
pre tax loss income on continuing operations income tax benefit expense major reconciling items state rate changes charitable contributions expiration capital loss valuation allowance equity compensation income tax benefit expense  adjusted for reconciling items in  we reduced our deferred tax asset by million for the value of charitable contributions that will not be realized as a tax deduction due to their expiration 
in addition  a tax valuation allowance of million was established in connection with a capital loss that will likely not be offset by future capital gains 
finally  the deferred tax asset was reduced by million to recognize the lower deduction available to the company as a result of the decrease in the value of the company s stock since certain restricted shares that vested in were granted 
in june  the state of ohio enacted new tax legislation that had the effect of eliminating million of the company s tax loss carry forwards carried in deferred tax 
the effect of this change in tax rates on future periods was not material 
services revenue generated by services across all segments was million or of total revenue  compared with and of revenue in the previous two years 
services comprise a meaningful and generally increasing share of the revenue mix in our pod services  document systems  and pathforward segments  as indicated in the table below 
rev rev rev service revenue document management label solutions pod services document systems pathforward total nd half our financial results for the second half of were significantly stronger than those in the first half as indicated in the table below

overall  our total revenue for is not expected to change significantly from we will carry our lower second half cost structure into and we will continue to pursue additional productivity gains and cost reductions during the year 
a portion of the savings will be reinvested during in pursuit of our long term strategic plan 
we expect a modest double digit increase in adjusted operating income  reflecting the lower cost structure and an improving product mix 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which include both continuing and discontinued operations  plus a summary of our significant contractual obligations 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in particular  we will segregate and highlight cash flows related to restructuring and contributions to our qualified pension plan  both of which are carefully monitored by management and have a significant and variable impact on cash flow 
in addition  because our outstanding debt is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million  we measure cash flow performance prior to debt borrowing or repayment 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized below cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items working capital restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan deferred compensation payments and other net cash provided by operating activities acquisitions capital expenditures proceeds from sale of plant  equipment  and discontinued operations proceeds from sale of equity investment net cash used for investing activities debt borrowings payments dividends paid other net cash used for financing activities net change in cash memo add back debt borrowed paid cash flow before change in debt cash flows net debt increased during from million at the outset of the year to an ending balance of million  reflecting a net cash outflow of million 
this compares to a cash outflow of million in and a cash inflow of million in restructuring payments increased slightly in versus prior years due to the restructuring actions taken in as part of our cost reduction initiatives 
contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million in and million in  up significantly from the million in we expect to make contributions of million per year for the next several years in order to move the plan toward fully funded status 
our estimated required mandatory pension funding requirement for is approximately million 
deferred compensation balances paid to associates and payments of supplementary pension benefits were significantly higher in  however  they were offset in part by million in cash received from the deferred compensation trust 
capital spending has been in the million range over the last several years  and we expect to spend between million for capital expenditures in proceeds from the sales of our terre haute and middlebury facilities contributed to the million of cash provided from the sale of assets 
the previously discussed sale of our digital solutions business provided million of cash in  and the sale of insystems provided million of cash in dividend payments were consistent in each year 
capital structure our capital structure appears in the table below capital structure total debt less cash and short term investments net debt equity total net debt total capital the million cash outflow described earlier for is reflected in the increase in net debt shown in the table above 
the company currently has a million senior secured revolving credit agreement credit facility with seven banks that permits borrowing and repayment as needed throughout the year 
the credit facility  which expires in may  is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  and certain other assets 
there is a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below million 
at year end  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million and unborrowed credit was million  net of letters of credit 
interest on the revolver is at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable spread based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  was at december  at the end of february  the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  had dropped to 
in addition  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility  currently the fee is basis points 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our existing credit facility are sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  dividends  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
in our judgment  our strong balance sheet could support additional debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  some of the amounts we included in this table are based on estimates and assumptions about our obligations  and the amounts we actually pay in the future may vary from the amounts reflected below 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt long term note payable operating leases purchase commitments pension plans postretirement benefit obligation total the debt payment information represents amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
no amounts for interest on amounts due are included 
the long term note payable due is related to the nps acquisition completed in we are obligated under operating leases for real estate  sales offices  transportation equipment  and computer and other equipment 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
we have no purchase agreements with suppliers extending beyond normal quantity requirements 
we have the following commitments at december purchase commitments for capital improvements aggregating million purchase commitments with copy equipment suppliers to spend a total of million in purchase commitments for telecommunications services from suppliers that provide for minimum annual commitments of million in multiple years remaining on commitments with software companies for total annual license maintenance fees of million 
we outsource certain information technology services from suppliers under multi year agreements that provide for early termination penalties 
at december   the early termination penalties total approximately million 
the remaining terms of the agreements range from one to four years 
as these remaining terms diminish  the amount of the termination penalties decline 
the pension plan obligations included in the table above represent benefit payments for to under the nonqualified defined benefit plans that are unfunded 
the amounts also include estimated required pension funding requirements for our qualified plan 
we expect to have required pension funding requirements in and that are not included because we do not know the amounts at this time 
the postretirement benefit obligation included in the table above represents healthcare benefit payments expected to be paid for future claims under the plan for to we have not included our fin liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits in the contractual obligation table because we cannot estimate the period of future cash payment  if any  for this liability 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings under our credit facility 
at december   we had million borrowed against the credit facility 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  was at december  a hypothetical basis point movement in the prevailing interest rates on the million of borrowings under the credit facility would result in a million annualized effect on our interest expense 
commodity prices paper is the principal raw material in the production of business forms 
because we have historically been successful in adjusting our sales prices in response to changes in paper costs  we do not believe a change in paper costs would have a material effect on our financial statements  however  an increase of in paper costs  if not recovered by us  would increase cost of sales by approximately million
