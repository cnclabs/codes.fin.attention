for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands equipment and software revenue aftermarket supplies revenue service revenue revenue equipment and software revenue growth in fiscal was driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  contribution from the data technology acquisition and sales of key new products 
the incremental impact of the data technology acquisition provided million of equipment and software revenue in fiscal key new equipment and software products revenue was million  million and million for the years ended april   and  respectively 
the growth in fiscal key new equipment products revenue of million was primarily from increased sales of the xlc multi ply gerbercutter and the taurus x series leather cutter featuring pivex technology within the apparel and flexible materials segment  partially offset by a decline within the sign making and specialty graphics segment  particularly from lower sales of the solara uv inkjet printer 
the company anticipates that the launch of the solara ion in fiscal will result in growth in key new equipment products revenue for the sign making and specialty graphics segment 
customer anticipation of the solara ion is considered by management to have slowed solara uv sales in the latter half of fiscal higher volume sales in china also contributed to the year over year growth for equipment and software revenue 
additionally  lower equipment sales volume within the ophthalmic lens processing segment in fiscal is considered by management to be attributable to weak united states market conditions and partially offset the fiscal equipment and software revenue growth 
aftermarket supplies revenue increased percent from fiscal to fiscal and increased percent from fiscal to fiscal this increase was primarily in the company s sign making and specialty graphic s international operations and was largely attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and organic growth 
service revenue increased primarily within the apparel and flexible materials segment over the past three years and was fueled by the impact of the increased equipment installed base 
the company expects that continued sales of key new products  including the recently introduced solara ion  the advanced lens processing system  and the gerbercutter z  as well as ongoing sales activity in china and other geographically significant regions should facilitate revenue growth in future periods

contribution to the company s consolidated revenue from the apparel and flexible materials segment increased in total dollars  but remained relatively constant on a percentage basis in fiscal the ophthalmic lens processing segment contributed less to consolidated revenue than in prior years  which management believes is primarily attributable to softness in the united states ophthalmic markets as well as the impact of customer consolidations  which affected both equipment and aftermarket product sales volume 
foreign currency translation contributed to the increased revenue in each segment in fiscal and revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of consolidated revenue in fiscal  and was as follows for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands north america europe rest of world a higher proportion of revenue has been derived from the company s international operations over the past few years and the effect of foreign currency translation favorably impacted the international revenue over the past three years 
the significant increase in europe revenue was attributable to organic growth from an increase in volume sales of aftermarket consumables 
the increase in revenue for the rest of world region was a result of the apparel and flexible materials business volume in asian markets and was attributable to both the continued migration of apparel production to growth markets  particularly china  and the success of new products 
this shift was also a factor in the lower percentage contribution of revenue in the north american region 
additionally  the ophthalmic lens processing business volume in north america markets has declined primarily as a result of softness in united states markets and the impact of recent customer consolidations 
as an international company  operating results are affected by global  industrial and political factors 
however  geographic and industry diversity has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the company s consolidated revenue and operating results

for fiscal  increased sales volume contributed to gross profit approximately million  while sales mix and pricing decreased gross profit by million as compared with fiscal the company s gross profit margin has declined slightly over the past two fiscal years 
the lower overall gross profit margins were primarily attributable to a higher contribution of revenue from the company s spandex business unit  which is an international distribution business and realizes lower gross margins than the company s manufacturing businesses

interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands interest expense weighted average credit facility interest rates interest expense primarily consists of interest costs incurred related to the company s borrowings and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
weighted average credit facility interest rates have steadily decreased over the past three fiscal years  primarily attributable to more favorable credit facility terms associated with the refinancings executed on october  and january  these refinancings reduced the amortization expense of debt issue costs  as such refinancings were less costly than previous refinancings 
an increase in the company s average debt balances in fiscal as compared with fiscal was associated with incremental borrowings to finance the data technology acquisition and resulted in higher interest expense in fiscal the new credit agreement entered into on january  is expected to result in lower weighted average interest rates  primarily as a result of lower amortization of deferred financing costs 
the company entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement  subsequent to april   to fix the interest rate on million of its variable interest rate debt

the company also plans to leverage data technology s product portfolio into sign making and specialty graphics applications 
gsp s revenue also benefited by million from the license of certain patents in fiscal inkjet printer equipment and aftermarket supplies revenue declined as compared with the prior year  which partially offset these increases 
the company believes that this decline occurred as a result of customers delaying purchases of inkjet printers in fiscal in anticipation of the upcoming launch of the solara ion in may advance customer orders for the solara ion as of the product launch date were in excess of million 
spandex s revenue benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and organic growth 
this organic growth was from higher aftermarket materials sales across each of its branches 
the higher sales volume included increased sales of digital products and a modest increase in core vinyl aftermarket products 
the company believes that the overall stronger performance was facilitated by favorable economic conditions in europe 
fiscal segment revenue increased million  or percent  as compared with fiscal foreign currency translation contributed million to this increase 
the remaining increase was related to increased international volume of aftermarket supplies and increased revenue from the solara uv inkjet printer as compared with fiscal gsp reported slightly lower revenue caused by a decline in sales of the company s thermal printing systems and related aftermarket supplies as compared with the same period of fiscal spandex reported significantly improved revenue for fiscal as compared with fiscal  after excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  which is attributable to an increase in aftermarket supplies volume and increased equipment revenue

although sales volume was elevated in china  gross profit margins were affected by pricing pressures in those markets as they continue to develop 
fiscal incentive compensation expense was million lower as compared with fiscal ophthalmic lens processing new product development efforts in this segment are focused on free form lens processing 
ophthalmic markets appear to be carefully evaluating this emerging technology 
during november  the company launched new products incorporating free form capability  which is a benefit particularly for the larger laboratories 
these products include the dtl generator and the maat polisher  which form the basis for the advanced lens processing system with free form capability 
ophthalmic markets are continuing to undergo industry consolidations  as larger laboratories are purchasing smaller independent laboratories  resulting in a smaller independent laboratory customer base

the primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the company s credit facility 
these sources of liquidity are subject to all of the risks of the company s business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for the company s products  charges that may be required because of changes in market conditions or other costs of doing business  delayed product introductions  or adverse changes to the company s availability of funds 
recent distress in the credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities

future compliance with the financial covenants may be adversely affected by various economic  financial and industrial factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the credit facility  allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of potential failure by the company to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  the company would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or obtain compliance waivers from its lenders 
the company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of april  the credit agreement also contains certain subjective acceleration causes  which upon the occurrence of a material adverse change in the financial condition  business or operations of the company in the view of the lenders material adverse change  may cause amounts due under the agreement to become immediately due and payable 
additionally  the credit agreement contains certain cross default provisions  which provide that default by the company under other lending arrangements could cause the company to be in default of the credit agreement 
the new credit facility is collateralized by first priority liens on selected assets and the pledge of capital stock of the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s participation in financing arrangements to assist customers in obtaining leases with third parties constitute the only off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec s regulation s k 
the company has agreements with major financial services institutions to assist customers in obtaining lease financing to purchase the company s equipment 
the financial services institutions are the lessor and the customer is the lessee 
these leases typically have terms ranging from two to six years 
as of april   the amount of lease receivables financed under these agreements between the external financial services institutions and the lessees was million 
the company s net exposure related to recourse provisions under these agreements was approximately million 
the equipment sold generally collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  the company has a liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions once the institution repossesses the equipment from the lessee and returns it to the company 
in most cases  the company then can resell the equipment  the proceeds of which are expected to cover a majority of the liability to the financial services institution 
as of april  and  the company recorded undiscounted accruals for the expected losses under recourse provisions of million and million  respectively 
contractual cash obligations and commitments as of april   the company had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments including restructuring related commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations lease obligations inventory and other purchase obligations qualified and non qualified pension funding total principal only  excludes interest payments 
the above table includes approximately million of non discretionary pension contributions expected in fiscal for the qualified pension plan 
this amount of non discretionary pension contribution is impacted by recent legislation under the pension protection act of  which significantly changes funding standards beginning in fiscal for the company 
the company expects to make additional cash contributions subsequent to fiscal  however  these amounts have been excluded from the table  since the timing of such contributions is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual plan activities 
amounts included in the table for pension contributions in excess of one year relate to the company s non qualified pension plan and a small international pension plan 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for more information about such tax benefits 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo cost method 
inventory at the apparel and flexible materials segment s foreign non manufacturing companies is valued on a weighted average basis  which approximates fifo 
the company reviews the market value of inventory on an ongoing basis 
based on these reviews  inventory write downs are recorded  as necessary  to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
the amount of these write downs equals the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolete inventory is generally identified by comparing expected inventory usage to actual on hand quantities 
inventory write downs are provided for on hand inventory in excess of pre defined usage estimates 
forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical actual inventory usage levels forward to future periods 
application of this methodology can have the effect of increasing inventory write downs during periods of declining demand 
inventories included a million reduction as of april  for the estimated lower of cost or market adjustment against the company s standard costs 
goodwill the company reviews the value of goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter  or sooner if events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
no indicators of goodwill impairment were identified during fiscal the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  which is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized  and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assess goodwill for impairment  internal valuation analyses are performed 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis 
this approach uses estimates and assumptions  including projected cash flows  discount rate assumptions and perpetual growth rate assumptions 
a percent decrease in the fair value of the company s reporting units at the fiscal evaluation date would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment in the apparel and flexible materials reporting unit  the ophthalmic lens processing or the spandex reporting units  but would have resulted in a step two test being required in the gerber scientific products reporting unit 
as of april   the company had million of goodwill assets on the consolidated balance sheet which management believes are realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing that value  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be re evaluated in the case of market deterioration  which could result in future impairment of those assets 
pension plans in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
the company adopted sfas on april  and was required to initially recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans and provide certain disclosures 
see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions relating to  among other variables  the expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these assumptions are updated at the measurement date and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized in future periods 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed considering several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium  an inflation estimate weighted towards future expectations  expectations for real returns  and adjustments for anticipated or historical economic changes using a long term investment horizon 
the effects of asset diversification and periodic fund rebalancing are also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the expected long term rate of return of the plan assets by percentage points would increase or decrease  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated income before income taxes by approximately million 
as of april  and for the year ended april   the discount rate utilized for determined future pension obligations of the pension plan was based upon the expected yields of high quality  long term corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent 
as of april  and for the year ending april   the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the pension plans is based on the company s estimated future cash payments mapped against expected yields of high quality  long term corporate bonds from a benchmark yield curve 
the resulting discount rate used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal will be percent 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate for the plans would increase or decrease  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated income before income taxes by approximately million 
the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels is calculated based primarily on expected wage inflation 
for fiscal  the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels used for determining net periodic pension expense was percent and will be percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the long term rate of increase in compensation levels by percentage points would decrease or increase  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated income before income taxes by approximately million 
pension expense for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
in subsequent fiscal years  future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  contributions  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  the company has analyzed its historical earnings in each jurisdiction taking into consideration the effect of certain nonrecurring items that negatively impacted earnings in those periods 
the company has also considered the favorable shift in profits between various jurisdictions resulting from tax planning strategies in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period such determination was made 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement assuming the tax authority has full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities routinely review the company s tax returns 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the impact of these examinations on the company s liability for income taxes cannot be presently determined 
in management s opinion  adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from these examinations based on the company s estimated range of exposure 
the company has not recognized united states tax expense on the unremitted earnings and other basis differences with respect certain of its foreign subsidiaries because it is not anticipated that such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
these undistributed earnings and basis differences were approximately million as of april  our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
credit market risk exposures recent distress in the credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult new financial environment  and although the duration and extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  the company does not currently expect that the credit market conditions will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity  financial position  operations or cash flows in fiscal foreign currency exposures foreign currency exposures are identified and managed at the corporate level 
to manage these risks  the company uses specific planning strategies with its operations located in various locations  which may include the use of foreign currency forward contracts  international tax transfer pricing strategies and intercompany loan planning strategies 
there were no foreign currency forward contracts in place as of april  or interest rate exposures the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates because it finances its operations through variable interest rate debt 
as of april   obligations under the company s credit facility bore interest at floating rates 
interest on obligations under the revolving credit facility is charged  at the option of the company  at the london interbank offer rate libor plus a variable margin  which varies based upon certain financial measurements  or at the lender s prime rate 
a percent change in the interest rate applicable to the company s million of variable rate credit facility debt would increase interest expense approximately million 
the company entered into an interest rate swap to exchange variable libor interest for a fixed interest rate subsequent to april  the company entered into this cash flow hedge for a two year period to fix its future interest payments on million of outstanding debt 
obligations under the outstanding million of industrial development bonds are at interest rates that are adjusted weekly to market rates 
a percent change in the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance on these bonds would not have a significant impact to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
