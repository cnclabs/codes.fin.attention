item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations we do not manufacture our own silicon wafers 
we maintain strategic relationships with large semiconductor foundries to source our finished silicon wafers 
this strategy allows us to focus our internal resources on product and market development  and eliminates the fixed cost of owning and operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
we are also able to take advantage of the ongoing advanced process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries 
in addition  all of our assembly operations and most of our test operations are performed by outside suppliers 
we perform certain test operations and reliability and quality assurance processes internally 
we have achieved and maintained iso quality management systems certification and iso quality systems certification  and released a full line of pld products qualified to the aec q reliability standard 
wafer fabrication we source silicon wafers from our foundry partners  fujitsu in japan  seiko epson corporation seiko epson in japan  united microelectronics corporation umc in taiwan and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
chartered semiconductor in singapore  pursuant to agreements with each company and their respective affiliates 
we negotiate wafer volumes  prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
assembly after wafer fabrication and initial testing  we ship wafers to independent subcontractors for assembly 
during assembly  wafers are separated into individual die and encapsulated in plastic or ceramic packages 
presently  we have qualified assembly partners in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
we negotiate assembly prices  volumes and other terms with our assembly partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
we currently offer an extensive list of standard products in lead pb free packaging 
our lead free products meet the european parliament directive entitled restrictions on the use of hazardous substances 
we continually review our suppliers to ensure they meet or exceed our packaging requirements 

table of contents testing we electrically test the die on each wafer prior to shipment for assembly 
following assembly  prior to customer shipment  each product undergoes final testing and quality assurance procedures 
final testing on certain products is performed by independent contractors in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea  and at our oregon facility 
marketing  sales and customers we sell our products directly to end customers through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent distributors 
we also employ a direct sales management and field applications engineering organization to support our end customers and indirect sales resources 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and military end markets 
as of december  we have agreements with manufacturers representatives and two primary distributors  arrow electronics  inc and avnet inc  in north america 
we have also established export sales channels in over foreign countries through a network of over sales representatives and distributors 
the majority of our sales are made through distributors 
we protect both of our primary north american distributors and some of our foreign distributors against reductions in published prices  and expect to continue this policy in the foreseeable future 
we also allow returns from these distributors of unsold products under certain conditions 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by these distributors to an end customer 
resale of product through these distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was in fiscal  in and in we provide technical and marketing support to our end customers with engineering staff based at our headquarters  product development centers and selected field sales offices 
we maintain numerous domestic and international field sales offices in major metropolitan areas 
export sales as a percentage of our total revenue were in fiscal  in and in export sales to china accounted for   and of revenue in fiscal   and  respectively  to japan accounted for   and of revenue in fiscal   and  respectively  and to taiwan accounted for   and of revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
both export and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales to japan  which are denominated in yen 
if our export sales decline significantly  there would be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our two largest customers are distributors and make up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by our distributor arrow electronics  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  and by our distributor avnet  inc  accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  or seasonality in most years  we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products 
sales of our products are often stronger in the first half of the year  and often weaker in the summer months 
in addition  december is often a weak month for sales 
however  on balance  general economic and semiconductor market conditions have a greater impact on our business and financial results than seasonal trends 

table of contents backlog our backlog of scheduled and released orders at december  was million  as compared to million at december  this backlog consisted of direct customer and distributor orders scheduled for delivery within the next days 
distributor orders accounted for the majority of the backlog in both periods 
direct customer orders may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled under certain circumstances without penalty prior to shipment 
additionally  distributor orders generally may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment 
furthermore  certain of our distributor shipments are subject to rights of return and price adjustment 
revenue associated with these distributor shipments is not recognized until the product is resold to an end customer 
typically  the majority of our revenue results from orders placed and filled within the same period 
such orders are referred to as turns orders 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement made at the beginning of a period 
we do not anticipate a significant change in this business pattern 
for these reasons  backlog as of any particular date should not be used as a predictor of revenue for any future period 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid rates of technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
our current and potential competitors include a broad range of semiconductor companies from emerging companies to large  established companies  many of which have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors in the programmable logic market include silicon and software product features  price  technical support  and sales  marketing and distribution strength 
the availability of competitive intellectual property cores is also critical 
in addition to product features such as density  performance  power consumption  reprogrammability  and reliability  competition occurs on the basis of price and market acceptance of specific products and technology 
we intend to continue to address these competitive factors by working to continually introduce product enhancements and new products and by working to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
we compete directly with actel corporation  altera corporation and xilinx  inc we also indirectly compete with other semiconductor companies that provide logic solutions that are not user programmable 
although to date we have not experienced direct competition from companies located outside the united states  such companies may become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
competition may also increase if other larger semiconductor companies seek to expand into our market 
any such increases in competition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
patents we seek to protect our products and technologies primarily through patents  trade secrecy measures  copyrights  mask work protection  trademark registrations  licensing restrictions  confidentiality agreements and other approaches designed to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop competitive technology not covered by our intellectual property rights or that measures we take to protect our technology will be effective 
we hold numerous domestic  european and asian patents and have patent applications pending in the united states  asia and europe 
our current patents will expire at various times between and there can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents  or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  there can be no assurance that our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
we believe that our success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  experience  creativity and the sales and marketing abilities of our personnel 

table of contents patent and other proprietary rights infringement claims are common in our industry 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to any claim made against us  that we would be able to successfully defend against the claim or that we could obtain a license that would allow us to use the proprietary rights on terms or under conditions that would not harm our business 
licenses and agreements advanced micro devices in  as part of our acquisition of vantis corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced micro devices  inc amd  we entered into an agreement with amd pursuant to which we have cross licensed vantis patents with amd patents  having an effective filing date on or before june   related to programmable logic products 
this cross license was made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we acquired certain third party license rights held by vantis prior to the acquisition 
agere systems in  as part of our acquisition of the fpga business of agere  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with agere and agere systems guardian corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  these agere companies assigned or licensed to us certain fpga and field programmable system chip patents  trademarks  software and other intellectual property rights and technology  and we licensed back rights in these same assets 
these cross licenses were made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
altera in  we entered into a comprehensive  royalty free  non exclusive patent cross license agreement and a multi year patent peace agreement with altera 
fujitsu on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the fujitsu app agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we advanced million to fujitsu in support of the development and construction of a mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
as of march  we had completed the unsecured advance payments to fujitsu 
during the third quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal  we entered into amendments amendments to the fujitsu app agreement 
prior to the amendments  our million advance was to be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from fujitsu 
the amendments permit us to also credit the advance against the purchase price of mm wafers and other services collectively  wafer credits and other services are referred to as advance credits  including engineering mask set charges 
the fujitsu app agreement will continue until the full amount of the advance payment has been returned to us in the form of advance credits  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
prior to the amendments  we could request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we had not used all of our wafer credits by december  pursuant to the amendments  we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our advance credits by december  the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
seiko epson epson electronics america epson electronics america  inc eea  an affiliated us distributor of seiko epson  has agreed to provide us with manufactured wafers in quantities based on six month rolling forecasts 
prices for the wafers obtained from eea are reviewed and adjusted periodically 
wafers for our products are manufactured in japan at seiko epson s wafer fabrication facilities and are delivered to us by eea 

table of contents in  we entered into an advance production payment agreement with seiko epson and eea which was subsequently amended in and under this agreement we advanced million to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
as of december   all of the payments had been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
we are not obligated to make additional payments under this agreement 
umc group in  we entered into a series of agreements with united microelectronics corporation umc  a public taiwanese company  pursuant to which we agreed to join umc and several other companies to form a separate taiwanese corporation  uicc  for the purpose of building and operating an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan  republic of china 
under the terms of the agreements  we invested million for an approximate equity interest in the corporation and the right to receive a percentage of the facility s wafer production at market prices 
in  we entered into an agreement with utek corporation utek  a public taiwanese company in the wafer foundry business that became affiliated with the umc group in  pursuant to which we agreed to make a series of equity investments in utek under specific terms 
in exchange for these investments  we received the right to purchase a percentage of utek s wafer production 
under this agreement  we invested million 
on january   uicc and utek merged into umc 
for financial reporting purposes  all of our shares of umc common stock are accounted for as available for sale and marked to market in our consolidated balance sheet until they are sold  at which time a gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
an other than temporary impairment of umc share value could result in a reduction of the consolidated balance sheet carrying value and would result in a charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
no employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
sales of our older products may decline faster than sales of our new products increase  which would result in reduced revenues and gross margins 
our product development strategy is to aggressively introduce new products in order to grow our overall revenue 
however  currently the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of mainstream and mature products 
mature products are older products that generally are no longer designed by customers into end systems and are sold to support the mass production of customer end systems in which they have historically been designed 
consequently  sales of these products have a tendency to decline as customer end systems gradually reach the end of their life cycles 
mainstream products are more recently introduced products that may still be designed by customers into new systems 
however  they are predominantly used in customer end systems that are in the early to mid life stage of their life cycles 
consequently  sales of mainstream products can be volatile and are subject to overall economic  industry and customer specific inventory conditions 
sales of mainstream products may increase or decline in a given period depending on conditions 

table of contents we have limited ability to predict or to foresee changes or the pace of changes in sales by product classification 
in recent periods  we have experienced increased rates of decline in sales of our mature products 
additionally  in the past we have also experienced periods of declines in sales of our mainstream products 
if in any period  the overall sales of the combination of our mature and mainstream products decline and if sales of new products do not increase at a rate that is sufficient to counteract this decline  then our total revenues would decline 
in addition  as mature products typically generate a higher gross margin than mainstream or new products generate  a faster than normal decline in sales of mature products could adversely impact our gross margins 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
the majority of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment end market 
any deterioration in this end market or any reduction in technology capital spending could lead to a reduction in demand for our products 
for example  in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
whenever adverse economic or end market conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may experience a disruption of our business activities due to the transition to a new chief executive officer 
on february   we announced that we had reached an agreement with our president and chief executive officer  pursuant to which he agreed to resign his positions with the company effective as of may  we are in the process of searching for a new chief executive officer  but there is no assurance that we will identify and reach an employment agreement with a new chief executive officer in sufficient time for the new chief executive officer to join the company by may  there is also no assurance that the new chief executive officer will be able to immediately lead the company in an effective manner or achieve the company s business objectives 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling the new fpga products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution and historically the market for fpga products has grown faster than the market for pld products 
currently we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from pld products than fpga products 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to introduce new fpga and associated software design tool products that meet evolving customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
we are presently shipping our next generation fpga product families that are critical to our ability to grow our fpga product revenue and expand our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner  or if these products or future new products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
fujitsu has agreed to manufacture our current and future fpga products on its nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
we have access to nanometer cmos process technology from fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier for our newest fpga products  our new wafer fabrication processes and our planned future fpga products 
the success of our next generation fpga products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in our efforts to partner with fujitsu in connection with these next generation fpga products  our future revenue growth would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the introduction of new silicon and software design tool products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market reception of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the potential impact of customer design in activity on future revenue is inherently uncertain and could impact our ability to manage production or our ability to forecast sales 
we face uncertainties relating to the potential impact of customer design in activity because it is unknown whether any particular customer design in will ultimately result in sales of significant volume 
after a specific customer design in is obtained  many factors can impact the timing and amount of sales that are ultimately realized from the specific customer design in 
changes in the competitive position of our technology  our customer s product competitiveness  our customer s product strategy  the financial position of our customer  and many other factors can all impact the timing and amount of sales ultimately realized from any specific customer design in 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately manage the production levels of our new products or accurately forecast the future sales of such products  and  thus  our operating results could be harmed 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non conformance to our specifications and certain other defects 
because our products  including hardware  software and intellectual property cores  are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology  our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects  whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments 
inability to detect a defect could result in increased engineering expenses necessary to remediate the defect and also result in increased costs due to inventory impairment charges 
on occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components and software or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product defects 
if there are material increases in product defects  the costs to remediate such defects  or the costs to resolve warranty claims compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 

table of contents a substantial portion of our short term and our entire long term marketable securities portfolio is invested in auction rate securities  a number of which have been the subject of failed auctions which have adversely affected the liquidity of these securities 
if auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security issuer  the third party insurer of such investments  the issuers of the investments underlying the securities or credit default swaps  or ambac assurance corporation ambac deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through an impairment charge 
at december  we held million in auction rate securities with investment grades of aaa or aa  which are variable rate debt instruments with long term stated maturities whose interest rates are reset through a dutch auction approximately every days 
while the auctions have historically provided a liquid market for these securities  due to liquidity issues in global credit and capital markets  a portion of the auction rate securities held by us have experienced multiple failed auctions beginning in october as the amount of securities submitted for sale at the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
our auction rate securities are collateralized by federally insured student loans  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  notes  high grade commercial paper  or bank deposit notes  however  million of our long term auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with the sale of credit default swaps  pursuant to which the assets underlying the auction rate securities are exposed to claims in the event of default of certain debt instruments owned by third parties 
a total of million of our auction rate securities were part of unsuccessful auctions and as a result  these instruments are considered illiquid and have been reclassified as long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  million of the auction rate securities in our portfolio were considered illiquid as of december   and  subsequent to december   an additional million of the auction rate securities  all of which are backed by federally insured student loans or municipal bonds  were part of unsuccessful auctions and are thus considered illiquid 
the remaining million of auction rate securities included in short term marketable securities has been called  redeemed  or sold since december   and the proceeds are now being held as cash or cash equivalents 
in addition  for million of our auction rate securities held in long term marketable securities  ambac can  under certain circumstances  exercise a put option  which essentially replaces the auction rate security investment with preferred stock of ambac 
if auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security issuer  the third party insurer of such investments  the issuers of the investments underlying the securities or credit default swaps  or ambac deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through an impairment charge 
any of these events could have a materially detrimental effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results during industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that contribute to these industry downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  general decline in end user demand  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
historically  the semiconductor industry has experienced periodic downturns of varying degrees of severity and duration 
typically  after such downturns  semiconductor industry conditions improve  although such improvement may not be significant or sustainable 
increased demand for semiconductor industry products may not proportionately increase demand for programmable logic products in general  or our products in 
table of contents particular 
even if demand for our products increases  average selling prices for our products may not increase  and could decline 
whenever adverse semiconductor industry conditions or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
further  our ability to predict end user demand is limited 
typically  the majority of our revenue comes from turns orders  which are orders placed and filled within the same quarter 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement at the beginning of a quarter 
accordingly  we cannot use backlog as a reliable measure of predicting revenue 
our wafer supply could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers and many of our products  including all of our newest fpga products  are manufactured by a sole source 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by fujitsu in japan  seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan and chartered semiconductor in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver high quality silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  our operating results could be harmed 
the reliable manufacture of high performance programmable logic devices is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers and ultra pure metals  the absence of defects in production wafers  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and us 

table of contents as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at fabrication facilities may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
our supply of assembled and tested products could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not assemble our finished products or perform all testing of our products 
currently  our finished products are assembled and tested by ase in malaysia  amkor in the philippines and south korea  fujitsu in japan  ait in indonesia  utac in singapore  and other independent contractors in asia 
if any of our current or future assembly or test contractors significantly interrupts or reduces our supply of assembled and tested devices  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers 
at present  we anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate 
however  these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our assembly and test capacity commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining deliveries of finished products consistent with the capacity commitments 
we negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis 
if any of our assembly or test contractors were to reduce its capacity commitment or increase its prices  and we cannot find alternative sources  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our supply of finished products are beyond our control 
because worldwide capacity for assembly and testing of semiconductor products is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall demand or interruptions in supply 
the assembly of complex packages requires a consistent supply of a variety of raw materials such as substrates  leadframes  and mold compound 
the worldwide manufacturing capacity for these materials is also limited and inelastic 
a significant industry wide increase in demand  or interruptions in the supply of these materials to our assembly or test contractors  could harm our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our assembly or test contractors operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our supply of assembled and tested devices and could harm our operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenue levels may be affected to a significant extent by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders 
the large number of individual parts we sell and the large number of customers for our products  combined with limitations on our and our customer s ability to forecast orders accurately and our relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles  may make it difficult to achieve a match of inventory on hand  production units  and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue projections 

table of contents if our assembly and test supply contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly contractor and us 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
our stock price may continue to experience large fluctuations 
historically  the price of our common stock has at times experienced rapid and severe price fluctuations that have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies  and any developments that materially adversely impact investors perceptions of our business prospects 
our stock price has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share for the fiscal year we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  
table of contents the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excess inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the willingness and ability of our customers and distributors to make payment to us in a timely manner  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at wafer fabrication facilities  changes in manufacturing yields including delays in achieving target yields on new products  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabrication facilities located in asia 
additionally  our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  the effects of currency fluctuation  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war  natural disaster  disease or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
export sales account for the majority of our revenue and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
we derive a majority of our revenue from export sales 
accordingly  if we experience a decline in export sales  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our export sales are subject to numerous risks  including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  war or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 

table of contents we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative technical solutions 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
we may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks  and  as a result  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
we carry insurance customary for companies in our industry  including  but not limited to  liability  property and casualty  worker s compensation and business interruption insurance 
we also self insure our employees for basic medical expenses  subject to a true insurance stop loss for catastrophic illness 
in addition  we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  we are self insured with respect to most other risks and exposures  and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitations before coverage applies 
based on management s assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is more cost effective to self insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures for which we self insure include  but are not limited to  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  theft  patent infringement and some employment practice matters 
should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 
changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect our consolidated statement of operations and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we have historically used equity incentives as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles that require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning in the quarter ended april  to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more expensive to grant stock options and other equity incentives to employees  we will incur increased compensation costs 
we also have changed our equity compensation strategy to  among other things  issue predominantly restricted stock units rather than stock options  and this could make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section compliance on an ongoing basis 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 

table of contents we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  without our operating results being adversely affected 
we face risks related to litigation 
we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims  including the pending patent litigation brought against us by lizy k 
john 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to potential claims made against us  we could resolve such claims under terms and conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our business  our liquidity or our financial results 
we have been and may in the future be subject to various other legal proceedings  including  as discussed in greater detail hereafter  claims that involve possible infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation matters  and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation 
any such litigation could result in a substantial diversion of our efforts and the use of substantial management and financial resources  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
further  an adverse determination in any such litigation could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lattice semiconductor corporation lattice or the company designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices plds and field programmable gate arrays fpgas each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military end markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income and allowances on sales to certain distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
revenue from sales to customers is generally recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and rights of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and cost relating to such distributor sales are deferred until either the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in income 
our revenue reporting is highly 
table of contents dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 
beginning in fiscal we entered into arrangements with certain distributors to issue accounts receivable credit adjustments distributor advances to reduce the distributors working capital required to service our end customers 
the distributor advances are for estimated future price discounts and are recorded as a reduction of deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
these arrangements are unsecured  bear no interest  are settled on a quarterly basis and are due upon demand 
the distributor advances have no impact on revenue recognition 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including market and economic conditions  product lifecycles and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized 
we test goodwill annually at fiscal year end for impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
the impairment test is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level 
we have assigned all goodwill to a single  enterprise level reporting unit 
the impairment test consists of two steps 
the first step of the test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the related carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we performed an impairment test as of december  and recorded a non cash impairment loss on goodwill of million and  as a result  we no longer have goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring costs include estimates for severance and other costs related to employee terminations  facility costs related to abandonment of various leased research and development sites  and other costs associated with the exit and disposal activities 
as changes to these estimates occur in subsequent periods resulting from timing changes or other factors  we will record either an increase or decrease to the estimated costs previously recorded 
it is possible that actual costs incurred in the future will differ from the amounts recorded at december  
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets 
effective december   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign countries 
we believe our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities may challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the greatest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for uncertain income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in our financial statements  and we also record in the provision for income taxes the estimated interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the estimated settlement value of uncertain tax provisions 
stock based compensation 
in the first quarter of  we adopted share based payment a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of substantially all of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
grants of restricted stock units are part of an overall revision of the company s equity compensation practices undertaken by the company  which  in part  has tied the number of shares to be granted in a given year to officers of the company  including executive officers  to the company s performance to its annual plan 
in order to implement the alignment of such equity incentive grants to annual plan performance  the timing of annual equity incentive grants to officers has been moved from the regularly scheduled board meeting occurring in the company s third fiscal quarter to the regularly scheduled board meeting occurring in the first fiscal quarter 
in addition  the vesting of restricted stock units granted to executive officers is contingent upon certain annual appreciation in the company s stock price 
the principal option plans provide for grants of restricted stock units to employees who are not officers 
the restricted stock units granted to employees who are not executive officers generally vest quarterly over a four year period beginning on the grant date 
restricted stock unit grants have replaced option grants as the principal form of equity compensation for non officer employees who receive equity grants 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   stock compensation expense related to acquisitions attributable to research and development activities and previously classified as part of amortization of intangible assets has been reclassified to research and development expense 
such deferred stock compensation attributable to research and development activities was completely recognized as of april  
table of contents correction of prior period financial statements 
we determined in the first quarter of fiscal that at december   the company s profit sharing accrual was overstated by million related to amounts originally provided for in fiscal we have corrected the fiscal and consolidated financial statements by reducing previously reported accrued payroll obligations and retained earnings accumulated deficit by the same amount under the provisions for making immaterial corrections outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
while this error was not material to any previously filed annual consolidated financial statements  management concluded that correcting the error of approximately million would be material to its consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year  and accordingly  prior period accrued payroll obligation and prior period retained earnings accumulated deficit have been restated to record the cumulative compensation expense in this form k 
results of operations key elements of our consolidated statement of operations were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  revenue gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative impairment loss on goodwill amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges loss from operations revenue revenue in fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in revenue from mature products  partially offset by an increase in revenue from new products 
revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to growth of new products and fpga products as well as strength in the communications  consumer and military end markets 
the communications end market accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal years  and for the and fiscal years 
accordingly  a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on the health of this end market 
the communications end market slowly improved throughout and the first half of before weakening in the later part of and revenue by product line from a product line viewpoint  in fiscal when compared to fiscal  there was a increase in fpga units sold primarily driven by an increase in fpga new products 
pld revenue decreased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  due to a decline in both units sold and average selling prices 
in fiscal  the increase in fpga and pld revenue was primarily the result of increased units sold when compared to fiscal 
table of contents the composition of our revenue by product line for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  fpga pld total revenue revenue by product classification revenue for new products increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of increased unit sales 
revenue from mainstream products decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal with a decline in both units sold and average selling price 
mature product revenue decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of decreased unit sales 
in fiscal the increase in new and mainstream revenue was primarily the result of an increase in units sold when compared to  while the decrease in mature revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in units sold 
among other things  future revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new products  as well as continued demand for our mature and mainstream products 
the composition of our revenue by product classification for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  new mainstream mature total revenue product classification new lattice xp  latticesc  latticeecp m  latticeecp  latticexp  machxo  power manager  ispclock mainstream fpsc  ispxpld  ispgdx  ispmach lv  ispgdx v  ispmach z  ispxpga  software and ip mature orca  orca  orca  isppac  isplsi v  ispmach b  ispmach lv  ispmach lv  isplsi v  isplsi v  ispmach vg  all volt cplds  all splds in fiscal we reclassified our new  mainstream and mature product categories to better reflect our current product portfolio 
fiscal and information has been adjusted to reflect these new product category classifications 
revenue by geography revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal  for and for export revenue as a percentage of overall revenue increased in fiscal compared to and due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards outsourcing of manufacturing by north american and european customers 

table of contents the composition of our revenue by geographical location of our direct and indirect customers is as follows in thousands year ended december  december  december  united states export revenue china europe japan taiwan other asia other americas total export revenue total revenue gross margin and operating expenses our gross margin percentage was for fiscal  for and for the decrease in gross margin percentage from fiscal to resulted primarily from a decline in revenue from mature products  which typically carry a higher gross margin than our other product categories  as well as revenue growth from new products  which typically carry an initial lower gross margin than our other product categories 
the increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal to reflects revenue growth in mainstream products  which had an improved margin in fiscal versus due to yield enhancements and cost reductions 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we initiated a last time buy program to recognize the obsolescence of certain mature products  resulting in a charge to cost of products sold to write down excess inventory 
research and development expense was million for fiscal compared to million for and million for research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in labor costs including stock based compensation offset by a decrease in expenses as a result of the restructuring plan implemented during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan  which is further described below  and a decrease in mask and wafer costs 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm  mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming increasingly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
the decrease in expense in fiscal compared to is primarily a result of the restructuring plan implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan  which resulted in the realignment of certain departments and job responsibilities further described below 
in addition  the decrease also resulted from stock based compensation expense related to previous acquisitions being fully recognized 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expense was flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  and included increased labor costs including stock based compensation offset by a million reversal of an accrual for legal expenses compared to a million reversal in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to is due to a number of factors including a 
table of contents reduction of sublease income  which is recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense  recognition of stock based compensation  increased commission and compensation related expense and the restructuring plan  which is further described below 
these increases were mostly offset by a million reduction in legal expenses in fiscal compared to primarily due to legal expenses related to shareholder class action suits  an sec informal inquiry  shareholder derivative suits  a special litigation committee investigation and audit committee investigation  all of which were resolved in early legal expenses related to these matters resulted in a total charge of million during fiscal at december   the estimated fair value of the company was below book value 
therefore  the company performed an impairment test on goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimated fair value of the company s equity to the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
fair value was based on a weighted average sum of the income approach  which used the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach  which used the market capitalization method 
in the allocation  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value  and  as a result  goodwill related to the acquisition of vantis corporation on june   the acquisition of integrated intellectual properties  inc on march   and the acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc on january  totaling million was written off and recorded as a non cash impairment loss on goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc and of cerdelinx technologies  inc amortization expense was million in fiscal  million in and million in amortization expense in fiscal decreased as a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the agere and cerdelinx acquisitions became completely amortized 
amortization expense in fiscal decreased as a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the agere acquisition became completely amortized 
amortization charges are expected to be eliminated after the first quarter of under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances require us to do so 
restructuring activity relates to the restructuring plans implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan and the third quarter of fiscal restructuring plan 
included in our consolidated statement of operations and reported as restructuring for fiscal  is a net charge of million 
this amount is comprised of charges under the restructuring plan of million  primarily related to a reduction in work force and a voluntary separation program for certain employees partially offset by a credit of million related to the settlement of the remaining lease obligation for our facility in the united kingdom  which was closed in connection with the restructuring plan 
charges under the restructuring plan primarily related to a reduction in work force and a voluntary separation program for certain employees 
on january   stephen a 
skaggs  president and chief executive officer and the company entered into an agreement pursuant to which mr 
skaggs is expected to resign as president and chief executive officer effective not later than may  the company expects to record approximately million in severance related costs on a prorated basis from february  through may  in addition  the terms of mr 
skaggs severance agreement allow for a partial acceleration of vesting of previously awarded stock options 
as a result  the company expects to record a non cash charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal related to the effects of accelerated vesting 
costs related to mr 
skaggs severance agreement will be charged to restructuring expense 
we will incur a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  related to an operating lease commitment for a portion of our facility in san jose  california 
we cannot be certain as to the actual amount of any remaining restructuring charges or the timing of their recognition for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents effective january   the company realigned certain departments and job responsibilities 
as a result  a portion of our historic cost center allocations have been realigned between selling  general and administrative and research and development to reflect our operations following the restructuring plan 
the realignment reduced fiscal research and development expense by approximately million  which was primarily offset by a corresponding increase in selling  general and administrative expense  when compared to fiscal interest and other income  net interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in average invested balances as a result of the use of cash for extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in convertible notes  partially offset by higher interest rates

for fiscal  other income  net  consisted of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of convertible notes  net of million of amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
to the extent market conditions allow  we may make similar sales of umc common stock in the future 
provision for income taxes we are paying foreign income taxes  which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations and are primarily related to the cost of operating an offshore research and development subsidiary and sales subsidiaries 
we are not currently paying federal income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes until the benefits of our tax net operating losses are fully utilized 
we expect to pay a nominal amount of state income tax 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition sources and uses of cash our sources and uses of cash from operating  financing and investing activities were as follows in thousands year ended december  december  december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal compared to operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to the million advance payment made to fujitsu in fiscal and a net loss of million which includes a non cash impairment charge to goodwill of million in fiscal 
table of contents compared to net income of million in fiscal additionally  cash used in operating activities increased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  net 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due to the sales of marketable securities to fund the million advance payment to fujitsu  and the million used to extinguish convertible notes in fiscal  compared to million used to extinguish convertible notes in fiscal  and an absence of sales of umc stock in  compared to sale proceeds of million in further  capital expenditures decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal in addition  in fiscal we received million in proceeds from the sale of land 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the use of million to extinguish convertible notes in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal compared to operating activities net cash used in operating activities decreased by million in fiscal as compared to the change is primarily related to recognition of net income in fiscal compared to a net loss in this was offset primarily by an increase in inventories during fiscal  compared to a decrease in due primarily to increased inventories related to new products in fiscal  while reduced starts and fewer receipts of wafers at the end of fiscal reduced the inventory balance 
also contributing to the offset in fiscal was cash used for an advance payment to fujitsu compared to the lesser payment made in in addition  while fiscal includes the charge related to the restructuring plan  the majority of the cash payments related to the restructuring plan were made in fiscal investing activities net cash provided by investing activities decreased by million for fiscal as compared to the change is due primarily to a decrease in the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock offset by an increase in net proceeds from short term investments 
net proceeds from the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for net proceeds from short term investments totaled in fiscal compared to million in further  capital expenditures were greater in fiscal  totaling million compared to million in financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased million for fiscal as compared to the decrease is due primarily to the use of million to extinguish our convertible notes in fiscal compared to million in further  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock for fiscal increased million over liquidity as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which was approximately million less than the balance of 
table of contents million at december  this decrease was due primarily to the million advance payment made to fujitsu  million used to extinguish convertible notes and million of illiquid auction rate securities reclassified to long term marketable securities at year end 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  we believe that our existing liquid resources and cash expected to be generated from future operations  combined with advance credits from foundries and our ability to borrow additional funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next twelve months 
as of march   we had completed the unsecured advance payments of an aggregate of million to fujitsu 
the advance payments will be returned to us in the form of wafer credits or other services including engineering mask set charges  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
collectively  wafer credits and other services are referred to as advance credits 
as of december   million had been returned to us in the form of advance credits  and we expect an additional million to be returned to us in the form of advance credits during the next twelve months 
beginning december   we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payments 
the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
from through december   we paid an aggregate of million to extinguish million principal amount of convertible notes 
although the convertible notes are due for payment in unless they have otherwise been redeemed  purchased  repurchased or converted prior to their maturity date  holders of the convertible notes have a right to require payment of the convertible notes on july   and we expect holders to exercise this right 
at december  we held million in auction rate securities with investment grades of aaa or aa  which are variable rate debt instruments with long term stated maturities whose interest rates are reset through a dutch auction approximately every days 
while the auctions have historically provided a liquid market for these securities  due to liquidity issues in global credit and capital markets  a portion of the auction rate securities held by us have experienced multiple failed auctions beginning in october as the amount of securities submitted for sale at the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
our auction rate securities are collateralized by federally insured student loans  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  notes  high grade commercial paper  or bank deposit notes  however  million of our long term auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with the sale of credit default swaps  pursuant to which the assets underlying the auction rate securities are exposed to claims in the event of default of certain debt instruments owned by third parties 
a total of million of our auction rate securities were part of unsuccessful auctions and as a result  these instruments are considered illiquid and have been reclassified as long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  million of the auction rate securities in our portfolio were considered illiquid as of december   and  subsequent to december   an additional million of the auction rate securities  all of which are backed by federally insured student loans or municipal bonds  were part of unsuccessful auctions and are thus considered illiquid 
the remaining million of auction rate securities included in short term marketable securities has been called  redeemed  or sold since december   and the proceeds are now being held as cash or cash equivalents 
in addition  for million of our auction rate securities held in long term marketable securities  ambac assurance corporation ambac can  under certain circumstances  exercise a put option  which essentially replaces the auction rate security investment with preferred stock of ambac 
if auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security issuer  the third party insurer of such investments  the issuers of the investments underlying the securities or credit default swaps  or ambac deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through an impairment charge 
any of these events could have a materially detrimental effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our financial statements 
the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at december  is lower than the amount shown as cash and short term investments in item  exhibit of our previously filed 
table of contents form k dated january  by million related to the reclassification of auction rate securities 
this reclassification has no impact on the consolidated statement of operations 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases purchase order obligations zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  later years certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through included in the table above for operating leases are the properties that were vacated  or plan to be vacated  as part of our and restructuring plans

in fiscal we entered into sublease agreements for a portion of the research and development facility in san jose  california and for the vacated premises in austin  texas 
this column excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities at december  on july   holders have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes in cash at of the principal amount of the convertible notes 
we expect holders to exercise the option 
our only significant operating leases  apart from those accrued for in the and restructuring plans  are for our facilities in san jose  california and bethlehem  pennsylvania 
our lease in san jose expires in december of annual rent is million and increases annually 
our lease in bethlehem expires in august of annual rent is million and increases annually

however  on december   the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position fsp sfas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no

the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
sfas no

is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december   our investment portfolio included million and million of fixed income securities  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at the years ended december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
furthermore  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our financial statements 
at december  we held million in auction rate securities with investment grades of aaa or aa  which are variable rate debt instruments with long term stated maturities whose interest rates are reset through a dutch auction approximately every days 
while the auctions have historically provided a liquid market for these securities  due to liquidity issues in global credit and capital markets  a portion of the auction rate securities held by us have experienced multiple failed auctions beginning in october as the amount of securities submitted for sale at the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
our auction rate securities are collateralized by federally insured student loans  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  notes  high grade commercial paper  or bank deposit notes  however  million of our long term auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with the sale of credit default swaps  pursuant to which the assets underlying the auction rate securities are exposed to claims in the event of default of certain debt instruments owned by third parties 
a total of million of our auction rate securities were part of unsuccessful auctions and as a result  these instruments are considered illiquid and have been reclassified as long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  million of the auction rate securities in our portfolio were considered illiquid as of december   and  subsequent to december   an additional million of the auction rate securities  all of which are backed by federally insured student loans or municipal bonds  were part of unsuccessful auctions and thus considered illiquid 
the remaining million of auction rate securities included in short term marketable securities has been called  redeemed  or sold since december   and the proceeds are now being held as cash or cash equivalents 
in addition  for million of our auction rate securities held in long term marketable securities  ambac can  under certain circumstances  exercise a put option  which essentially replaces the auction rate security investment with preferred stock of ambac 
if 
table of contents auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security issuer  the third party insurer of such investments  the issuers of the investments underlying the securities or credit default swaps  or ambac deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through an impairment charge 
any of these events could have a materially detrimental effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our financial statements 
the fair market value of the convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the convertible notes and the fair market value of the company s common stock 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
at december  and december   the fair value of the convertible notes was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices and recent sales 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  we sell products to japanese customers denominated in yen 
we are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
to minimize foreign exchange risk related to yen based net assets on our consolidated balance sheet  on august   we entered into an agreement with a bank under the terms of which we can borrow up to million in japanese yen in a revolving line of credit arrangement 
outstanding borrowing is collateralized by a market rate investment account 
interest on outstanding borrowing is based on the japanese libor fixed rate  and averaged for the year ended december  outstanding borrowing at december  was million 
this arrangement can be terminated at any time by either party 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of the years ended december  or december  we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques 
as a result  sustained changes in the market price of umc common stock could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc common stock experiences deterioration for an extended period of time  our operating results could be adversely affected
