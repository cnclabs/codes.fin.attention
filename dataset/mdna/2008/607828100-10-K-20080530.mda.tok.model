item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan founded in  modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
we operate on continents  in countries  with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in automobiles  light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems  off highway and industrial equipment  and fuel cell applications 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  and exhaust gas recirculation egr coolers 
consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche highway  off highway and industrial end markets 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
in order to reach our goal  our strategy is diversification by geography and by end market 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and operational and financial discipline for improved profitability and long term stability 
effective execution of these strategies will assist us in meeting our long term financial goals of return on average capital employed of percent to percent  organic revenue growth of percent to percent  total debt to capital ratio below percent  gross margins of percent to percent  and selling  general and administrative sg a costs less than percent of sales 

table of contents development of new products and technologies for increasingly diverse end markets our heritage and a current competitive strength is our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new  emerging markets 
we own three global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the us  in bonlanden  germany  and in asan city  south korea 
our reputation for providing quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with few product warranty issues 
in fiscal we spent million representing approximately percent of sg a expenses on our product and technology research and development efforts 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers who recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and are patent protected 
we have been granted over  patents on our technologies over the life of the company and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 
strategic planning and corporate development we employ both a short term and longer term three to five year strategic planning process enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  both by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
for the most part  we generate our ideas for potential acquisitions internally 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our success from this process has been our expansion activities into niche hvac and refrigeration markets 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
we historically operated with a small plant philosophy prior to our recent repositioning activities  but the competitiveness of the global market place requires us to move toward a greater manufacturing scale in order to create a more competitive cost base 
as costs for materials and purchased parts rise due to global increases in the metals commodity markets  we seek low cost country sourcing when appropriate and enter into contracts with some of our customers which provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
in addition  we have been utilizing futures contracts related to various forecasted commodity purchases to reduce our exposure to changes in these commodity prices 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  intended to enable increased profitability and cash flows over the long term with particular emphasis on working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals driving past and current improvement in global cash and debt management and access to sufficient credit 
this focus has given us the flexibility to capitalize on acquisition opportunities  other investments and joint ventures  research and development  stock buy backs  and pay dividends 
it also helps us identify and take action on underperforming assets in our portfolio  such as our electronics cooling business  which was recently sold 
our executive management incentive compensation is based on a return on net assets calculation that drives our singular focus for alignment with shareholders interests when it comes to our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees which is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the performance of the company over a time frame greater than a year 
this plan is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards which are based on a mix of earnings per share growth and growth in our stock price relative to the market 

table of contents consolidated market conditions and trends the original equipment manufacturer oem market place which we serve is extremely competitive and our customers are demanding that we continue to provide high quality products in combination with annual price decreases 
at the same time  we are experiencing increases in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  steel  and stainless steel nickel 
the combination of these factors impacts our profitability 
material increases are subject to pass through to our customers on a lag basis 
this lag period can average up to a year  based on the agreements we have with an individual customer  and some of our customers are pushing back on our attempts to pass these costs on 
in addition to our negotiations to pass material costs on to our customers  our strategy to mitigate growing cost pressures is to accelerate new product development and geographic expansion into new and existing niche markets 
we continue to focus on developing new and expanded proprietary technology that is of more value in the marketplace such as our early stage development of fuel cell technology for energy  vehicular and other applications 
our response to current market conditions in response to the near term conditions facing the company  we have implemented the following strategies to mitigate the effects these pressures have on our margins and our goals for profitable growth and return targets o manufacturing realignment 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of four manufacturing facilities in the us during fiscal  we announced the closure of three additional manufacturing facilities in the us camdenton  missouri  pemberville  ohio  and logansport  indiana  and our t bingen  germany manufacturing facility 
we also have invested in four new plants in low cost countries  including our recently completed facilities in changzhou  china and nuevo laredo  mexico and our facilities currently under construction in gy ngy s  hungary and chennai  india 
when the manufacturing realignment process is completed  we will compete for new business from a much improved cost competitive position with increased asset utilization across the platform 
this process should benefit the company at both the gross and operating margin level and help us win incremental profitable business 
o portfolio rationalization 
during fiscal  we announced the establishment of globally focused product groups of engine products  powertrain cooling products  and passenger thermal management products which support our regional segments of original equipment asia  original equipment europe  original equipment north america  and south america 
the company is assessing its product lines globally and its regional businesses in order to assess the competitive position and attractiveness of these products and businesses 
the goal of this process is to identify products or businesses which should be divested or exited as they do not meet required financial metrics 
an example of this portfolio rationalization process is the may  sale of our electronics cooling business for million 
this business has historically not generated our targeted returns  and the divestiture of this business should improve our overall operating margins 
o capital allocation 
our business is capital intensive  requiring a significant amount of investment in the new technologies and products which the company supports 
we recently introduced an enhanced capital allocation process which is designed to allocate capital spending to the segments and programs that will provide the highest return on our investment 
all business units are measured using specific performance standards and they must earn the right to obtain capital to fund growth through their performance 
o selling  general and administrative cost containment 
the company has a target of driving sg a levels down to percent of sales 
progress was made toward this goal during fiscal  with sg a as a percentage of sales declining from percent in fiscal to percent in the current year 
our goal is to achieve the percent of sales by fiscal through continued revenue growth in combination with diligent sg a cost containment 

table of contents segment information strategy  market conditions and trends in the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented certain management reporting changes which resulted in the brazilian operation being reported in a newly established south america segment  the original equipment americas segment being renamed original equipment north america  certain supporting departments previously included within corporate and administrative being realigned into the original equipment north america segment  the commercial hvac r segment renamed commercial products  and the other segment renamed to fuel cell since the electronics cooling business is presented as a discontinued operation 
the original equipment asia and original equipment europe segment have no changes 
the segment information for fiscal and has been revised to reflect these changes on a comparable basis 
each of these segments is managed at the regional vice president or managing director level and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used in evaluating the performance of each business segment  and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily based on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate sg a expenses 
original equipment asia percent of fiscal revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing vehicular climate control systems  powertrain cooling systems and engine products to various industrial end markets  with the greatest percentage for commercial light truck applications 
these products are sold primarily to south korean oems who export a significant portion of vehicles to other countries 
our largest customers are hyundai motor company and kia motors corporation 
competitors include the halla group of visteon corporation  doowon climate control company ltd  samsung electronics  and others 
a significant trend in our asian business is our customers emphasis on lower price over better technology  evidenced by significant price reduction demands from hyundai motor and kia motors  two of our key customers 
many of our products are becoming commoditized because of local suppliers ability to compete head on with pricing 
this pricing environment requires a low cost manufacturing profile and continued operating efficiencies in order to maintain a profitable business environment 
this is particularly applicable in our south korean business  where we have historically been unable to offset customer price reductions with additional operating improvements 
many components that we have supplied in this region are becoming part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy in this business is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and focus on building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region in a more cost competitive manner 
construction is currently underway on our new manufacturing facility in chennai  india  and it should be ready for production in fiscal construction of the manufacturing facility in changzhou  china is complete and we are currently shipping low volumes of production from this location 
several new products are scheduled to begin production in this new facility over the next fiscal year 
original equipment europe percent of fiscal revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems as well as vehicular climate control components to various end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  egr products  retarder and transmission cooling components  and hvac condensers 
competitors include behr gmbh co 
kg  valeo  denso corporation  akg  and a variety of other companies 
the business experienced strong growth with the general expansion of the european market in fiscal and fiscal our european operation was able to benefit from the growth of its medium to heavy truck customers  its construction machinery customers and its automotive customers alike 
at the same time the business has been successful in winning additional program awards that will start production beginning in the time frame 
going forward  we expect to see a further consolidation of the customer base as well as additional emission legislation that will cause the need for more cooling products and other new products and systems 
trends affecting our european business include significant price down demands from our european based customers  price competition from low cost country manufacturing locations  and material cost increases for aluminum  stainless steel and energy which have not been offset entirely by pass through agreements with our customers 
at the same time customer service expectations have increased 

table of contents to offset these difficult market conditions in the short term  we continue our focus on various lean manufacturing initiatives  low cost country sourcing and a critical review of all sg a related activities 
for mid and long term improvement  we are in the process of adjusting our manufacturing footprint  and have begun construction of a new facility in hungary 
at the same time we have started to phase out our existing facility in t bingen  germany 
we believe there is an opportunity to be more cost competitive and grow our business at a higher rate if we expand our operations into lower cost geographic areas like eastern europe 
in addition  we expect our european business to benefit from the output of our technology initiatives  which will contribute to establishing technological differentiation in the market place and thus provide leverage for new customer agreements 
the continued profitability of this business is dependent upon a further strengthening of our customer relationships  on the continued growth of our employee capabilities  on the strengthening of our advanced product development capabilities  and on the automation and reduced cost base in our manufacturing environment 
in the interim  management is focused on process improvement in all areas and the implementation of favorable longer term customer agreements 
original equipment north america percent of fiscal revenues our original equipment north america segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made by commercial vehicle oems  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor homes and motor coaches 
it also serves the automotive  heavy duty  and industrial markets  including agricultural  construction and industrial markets  ie lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
the majority of our north american business is derived from commercial vehicle customers 
the environmental protection agency emissions mandates january  and the upcoming january  create cyclicality in the class heavy truck commercial vehicle build rates due to pre buy activity which occurs prior to these emission law changes 
the expected cyclical downturn in this market after the january  emissions law change has been adversely impacted by the current economic concerns credit crisis  high oil and diesel prices  and depressed housing market which has reduced the demand for class trucks used to haul freight 
as a result  truck build rates in fiscal were percent below the prior year levels 
while the january  emissions change and economic concerns created a downturn in build rates  the change did provide an opportunity for us  as more of our components are required on each vehicle to meet the new standards 
additionally  we have increased our share in this market as a result of new business wins 
our north american automotive business has experienced considerable deflationary price pressure from oems  while at the same time the cost of raw materials and purchased parts has increased 
many of our us competitors continue to be financially challenged 
as a result  we have experienced increased opportunities to bid on business that was previously not available to us 
a positive trend in our north american heavy duty and industrial businesses is increased emission standards for agricultural and construction equipment  which is driving increased demand for our components such as egr coolers 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes the following components first  our strategy is to reposition the segment  including reassessing our manufacturing footprint  improving sourcing of raw materials and purchased parts  and other programs intended to increase efficiency and right size capacity 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of three north american manufacturing facilities within this segment  consolidating the business into other existing locations 
in addition  construction of our new facility in nuevo laredo  mexico  was completed during fiscal second  we are focused on reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth  while at the same time rationalizing the existing product lines that do not meet required financial metrics 
third  we are focused on pursuing only selected new business opportunities that meet our minimum targeted rates of return which will enable profitable growth to the company 

table of contents south america percent of fiscal revenues our south america segment provides heat exchanger products to a variety of markets in the domestic brazilian market as well as for export to north america and europe 
this business provides products to the on highway commercial vehicle markets  off highway markets including construction and agricultural applications  automotive oems and industrial applications  primarily for power generation systems 
this business also provides products to the brazilian  north american and european aftermarkets for both automotive and commercial applications 
we manufacture radiators  charge air coolers  oil coolers  auxiliary coolers transmission  hydraulic  and power steering  engine cooling modules and hvac system modules 
we have benefited from strong revenue growth in the brazilian market related to strong economic conditions in brazil and increased business awards from our oem customers 
the aftermarket sales under the radiadores visconde brand have continued to improve while export sales have been negatively affected by the weakening of the us dollar at the same time that the real has strengthened against global currencies 
we made capital investments in bar plate technology for our brazilian operations in fiscal that will continue to help fuel growth in the region as well as support operations in north america and europe 
competitors in the oem sector include behr gmbh co 
kg  valeo sa  denso corporation and delphi corporation 
our aftermarket competitors also include these same major competitors as well as some regional competitors that focus specifically on the brazilian aftermarket 
commercial products percent of fiscal revenues our commercial products business provides a variety of niche products in north america  europe  asia and south africa that are used by engineers  contractors and building owners in applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
we manufacture coils copper tube aluminum fin coils and all aluminum microchannel coils for heating  refrigeration  air conditioning and vehicular applications 
we also manufacture heating products for commercial applications  including gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  low intensity infrared and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products for commercial applications include single packaged vertical units and vertical unit ventilators used in school room applications  computer room air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers  ceiling cassettes  and roof top cooling units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
competitors include lennox international inc adp  luvata heatcraft eco  thomas betts reznor  mestek inc sterling  emerson electric company liebert hiross  united technologies corporation carrier and johnson controls  inc york 
revenues have increased primarily due to the acquisition of airedale in fiscal however  the segment has grown organically as well  due to growth in coil sales and unit heater sales in north america 
margins in this business have been negatively affected by increased commodity costs a trend which is expected to continue 
economic conditions  such as demand for new commercial construction  are drivers of demand for the heating and cooling products 
fuel cell percent of fiscal revenues our fuel cell business is a developmental stage enterprise supporting the highly complex thermal management needs of fuel cell systems 
these fuel cell systems are used in stationary power applications  micro chp  vehicle engine applications  and hydrogen fuel processing 
as macro economic trends have shifted causing increased development of alternatives to oil based fuel  we have intensified our activity in this business 
during fiscal  we continued to work with bloom energy to provide components for their early stage prototype stationery power units that should be commercially available in the next few years 
we view our thermal solutions for stationery power units as a potentially significant long term growth driver for the company due to increased global demand for fuel cell technology  driven by demand for a sustainable  environmentally sound and independent means of power 

table of contents in the past year we have increased our solid oxide fuel cell activities and have begun developing products in support of the micro chp combined heat and power market 
these fuel cell based systems are expected to emerge  primarily in europe  over the next several years as a direct replacement for the small boilers found in homes using hydronic heating systems 
in addition to efficient production of hot water for heat  the device is designed to produce electricity to supplement the electrical needs of the home 
we have been working with ceres power  a uk based developer of these systems  to expand the company s presence in this residential market 
we are not aware of any competitor of ours that has the same level of focus on this market 
outlook challenging market factors are expected to continue to impact the business into fiscal  including ongoing raw material cost increases  as well as continued pressure from vehicular customers for product price reductions 
fiscal is anticipated to be positively impacted by a strong line up of new business programs  continued strength in our original equipment europe and south american businesses  as well as within our north american and united kingdom heating and air conditioning markets in our commercial products business 
the anticipated continued strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the euro  should also positively impact our business 
these positive factors will be partially offset by continued low truck build rates in the us  as well as a difficult south korean business environment 
in fiscal and beyond  we intend to remain focused on our strategies of realigning our manufacturing footprint and rationalization of our portfolio 
when completed over the next two years  these strategies and actions will make us a more cost competitive  innovative and efficient technology provider to our current and future customers 
we believe these actions will help us to achieve our long term goals of percent to percent return on average capital employed  percent to percent gross margin  percent sg a as a percentage of sales  and asset turnover of times our annual sales 
consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal revenues were billion  representing an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal the growth in revenues was primarily related to strong volumes in europe  south america  and commercial products 
in fiscal we reported a loss from continuing operations of million compared to earnings from continuing operations of million in fiscal the increase in revenues was more than offset by a reduction in gross margins related to lower than anticipated north america truck volumes  manufacturing inefficiencies experienced as part of plant closures and consolidations  and pricing pressures from customers 
during fiscal  the following significant charges were recorded by the company goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in our original equipment north america business 
during the fiscal year  the company s outlook for this business was reduced  which resulted in the book value of assets employed in this business exceeding the fair value of this business 
several factors contributed to this reduced outlook for the original equipment north america business o our future growth prospects within this business have declined from previous management projections 
the recent decline in the north american truck market has caused us to reexamine our assumptions around future emissions law changes  specifically the upcoming change in fiscal in addition  we are estimating reduced prospects for future business  as our customers have shifted programs outside of north america 
o our future outlook includes lower margins than our previous expectations for this business 
plant closures and inefficiencies related to new product launches are having a near term impact on our margins  and continued industry wide customer pricing pressures are anticipated to adversely affect the north american vehicular market 
our products have an increasing material content  which makes offsetting these pricing pressures through manufacturing improvements more difficult 
long lived asset impairment charges we recorded impairment charges of million against certain long lived assets 
included in this amount is a million charge related to an impairment review of our south korean business  as this business continues to underperform our expectations and financial targets 
a charge of million was related to an impairment review of our long lived assets in original equipment north america  where a program was identified as being unable to support its asset base 
an additional million charge was related to an impairment of long lived assets in the commercial products segment for the cancellation of a product in its development stage 
the remaining million impairment charge was recorded for our t bingen  germany manufacturing facility in europe  which will be closed 

table of contents repositioning charges we recorded repositioning charges of million related to our manufacturing realignment activities including the completed closure of our toledo  ohio and richland  south carolina facilities within the original equipment north america segment 
included in this amount is million of restructuring charges and million of other related costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million primarily against the net deferred tax assets in the us and south korean tax jurisdictions 
this valuation allowance contributed to the increase in the provision for income taxes from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the valuation allowance charges primarily related to projected losses in the us and south korea  which resulted in the determination that it was more likely than not that the us and south korean deferred taxes would not be realized  requiring a full valuation allowance 
the current year decline in profitability in our original equipment north america business  coupled with the decline in future outlook for the north american and south korean businesses  were significant factors contributing to the projected losses and the need for the valuation allowance

revenues were driven by strong foreign volumes in the original equipment europe  south america and commercial products segments  which were offset by declines in the original equipment north america segment primarily in the truck market 
gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition  gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross margin is primarily driven by the impact of the decrease in north american truck volumes  manufacturing inefficiencies experienced as part of plant closures and consolidations  and pricing pressures from customers 
in addition  repositioning costs of million were recorded in gross profit during fiscal  as the company continued to reposition its global manufacturing footprint 
sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of sales to percent from percent 
the net increase is primarily due to ongoing expansion in the original equipment asia segment 
restructuring charges were consistent from fiscal to fiscal  and related primarily to severance costs incurred under our announced restructuring plans 
during fiscal  asset impairment charges of million were recorded including a goodwill impairment charge of million and a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment north america segment  a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment europe segment  a long lived asset impairment charge of recorded in the original equipment asia segment  and a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the commercial products segment 
the decrease in gross profit combined with the impairment charges contributed to the million decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal 
table of contents interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance capital expenditures of million and a million increase in working capital 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in the provision for income taxes was due to a valuation allowance of million recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us and south korean tax jurisdictions 
due to the current market conditions and future projections in these tax jurisdictions  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the us and south korean deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance recorded during the year 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was driven by million of acquired revenues related to the may acquisition of modine brazil  million related to favorable impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates and million of organic growth 
organic revenues were driven by strength in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets 
strong sales in the european automotive  north american truck and global heavy duty markets were offset by moderate declines in the north american automotive market  based on continued softness experienced in the market and overall price down pressures reducing sales prices per unit 
gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily driven by higher global commodity pricing and customer price decreases experienced during the fiscal year 
gross margin decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the primary contributing factor to the decline in gross margin has been the steady increase in raw material prices which started during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and continued through fiscal the most significant commodities used in our manufacturing process are aluminum  copper and nickel 
aluminum prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal  and copper prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal nickel has experienced a percent increase on average from fiscal to fiscal which resulted in considerably more cost to the company 
we have agreements with certain customers to pass through these higher commodity prices to them in our sales price  however  these pass through agreements can lag up to one year behind the actual price increases  or may not provide us the ability to recover the entire material price increase 
these commodity price increases were the primary factor contributing to the decrease in gross margin  as the material component of cost of sales increased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal in addition  repositioning costs of million were recorded in gross profit during the fiscal year as the company continued to reposition its manufacturing footprint 
sg a expenses and restructuring charges increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in sg a was related to the acquisition of modine brazil in may the remaining increase in sg a was primarily driven by million of repositioning costs recorded during fiscal the decrease in gross profit combined with the increase in sg a expenses contributed to the million decrease in operating income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate achieved in conjunction with refinancing activities completed during the fiscal year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance the modine brazil acquisition of million and the share repurchase program of million 
other income increased million from fiscal to fiscal this increase is primarily due to a purchase price settlement of million received during fiscal relating to the fiscal acquisition of winiamando s automotive climate control division 
this is partially offset by the reduction in equity earnings of non consolidated joint ventures due to the may acquisition of the remaining percent of modine brazil 

table of contents the provision for income taxes decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition  the effective income tax rate decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was related to a million benefit from net operating losses in brazil that were previously unavailable prior to the acquisition of modine brazil  and a tax benefit of million from a research and development tax credit which was extended 
the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the brazil net operating loss benefit  the research and development credit discussed above  as well as the impact of various state and foreign income taxes 
discontinued operations on may   the company announced it would explore strategic alternatives for its electronics cooling business and presented it as held for sale and as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the electronics cooling business was sold on may  for million  resulting in a gain on sale 
on july   the company completed the spin off of its aftermarket business and the immediate merger of the spun off business into proliance international  inc formerly known as transpro  inc 
the aftermarket business has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge to earnings of million to reflect the difference between the value that modine shareholders received in proliance  a function of the price of proliance 
at the time of the closing of the spin off  and the asset carrying value of modine s aftermarket business 
after earnings loss from discontinued operations and loss on spin off of discontinued operations  a net loss of million was reported in fiscal  and net earnings of million and million were reported in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

the fiscal increase was partially offset by a general softness experienced in the korean economy early in fiscal coupled with a strike at a customer facility 
foreign currency exchange rate changes favorably impacted sales by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin has decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal weak sales volumes resulting from the strike at a customer facility  as well as customer pricing pressures  drove this decrease in fiscal gross margin increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal due to purchasing savings and higher sales volumes which offset customer price downs 
sg a expenses remained consistent in fiscal and fiscal and increased million in fiscal this increase is due to ongoing expansion in this region with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in china and india  as well as the establishment of a corporate office in china 
the new manufacturing facility in changzhou  china began production in the third quarter of fiscal  and the chennai  india facility is scheduled to being production in the second quarter of fiscal long lived asset impairment charges of million were recorded during fiscal related to an impairment review of the south korean business which has historically underperformed our expectations  and is projected to continue to underperform into the future 
improved financial performance for this business is dependent on significant commercial concessions by the primary customers  as well as labor cost reductions 

table of contents original equipment europe years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of long lived assets income from continuing operations net sales within the original equipment europe segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal primarily from growth in the heavy duty market 
during fiscal  the million  or percent increase in net sales was primarily based on strength in powertrain cooling products  engine related products and condenser sales volumes 
exchange rate changes of million and million had a favorable impact on net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin has gradually declined over the past few years from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to higher commodity prices and certain warranty issues experienced during fiscal  as well as customer pricing pressures by the oems 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to a change in mix of sales towards lower margin products  as well as customer price downs which we were not entirely able to offset with purchasing savings and performance improvements in our manufacturing facilities 
sg a expenses were consistent over the past three years on a larger sales base  resulting in an improvement as a percentage of sales within this segment 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal at the t bingen  germany manufacturing facility in conjunction with the announced closure of this facility within the next to months 
income from continuing operations decreased million in fiscal due to the reduction in gross margin 
income from continuing operations improved million in fiscal based on the contribution impact of the increased sales volumes 
construction is currently underway for our new gy ngy s  hungary facility within this region  with production scheduled to begin in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  adjustments of million were recorded within this segment to correct errors that related to prior quarters and annual periods consisting of million related to an understatement of accounts payable and million related to the understatement of a value added tax liability 
these adjustments were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal as they were deemed immaterial to previously issued financial statements and full year fiscal results 
based on these adjustments  we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to ineffective controls over reconciliations within this segment 
we are developing and implementing remediation plans to address this material weakness including the creation of a standardized workplan for account reconciliations and trial balance reviews which will be accompanied by appropriate monitoring procedures

in addition  sales in the automotive market are down due to higher gas prices and a consumer shift from light trucks and full suvs to cars and small suvs 
gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal  and decreased further to percent in fiscal the deterioration in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal has been driven by the following two factors the significant reduction in sales volumes has resulted in a decline in gross profit  an underabsorption of fixed overhead costs and a lower gross margin as we have excess capacity in many of our north american facilities and the manufacturing realignment currently in progress in north america  including the process of closing operating facilities  transferring and consolidating product lines and launching new product lines has caused operating inefficiencies which have impacted the gross margin 
sg a expenses have held relatively consistent yet increased as a percentage of sales within this segment from fiscal to fiscal a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during fiscal as a result of a declining outlook for this segment

in addition  foreign currency exchange rate changes favorably impacted sales by million 
gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  and showed slight improvement to percent in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the changing mix of products within this segment toward lower margin air conditioning products

liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under lines of credit provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
the company expects to meet its future operating  capital expenditure and strategic acquisition costs primarily through these sources 
during fiscal  the company reported cash flows from operating activities of million  which is million less than the million reported in the prior year 
as a result of this decrease  the company increased its outstanding borrowings by million during fiscal  providing the company with the ability to fund million of capital expenditures for various key programs and pursue growth opportunities while addressing challenging market conditions 
the company maintains a solid balance sheet and financial position  and expects cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the credit agreements to be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
working capital  which continues to be a key management focus  was million at the end of fiscal  higher than the million balance one year ago  primarily due to working capital needs with the growing business volumes 
compared with the prior year  days sales outstanding improved two days to days 
inventory turns improved from to turns 
cash increased million to million at march  the ratio of modine s total debt to capital was percent at the end of fiscal compared to percent at the end of fiscal worldwide  modine had approximately million in unused lines of credit at march   compared with million at march  an additional million is available on the credit line revolver  subject to lenders approval  bringing the total available to million in fiscal the revolving credit agreement matures in october and the company has begun the renegotiation process to refinance this debt 
certain of the company s debt agreements require it to maintain specific financial ratios and place certain limitations on dividend payments and the acquisition of our common stock 
at december   we would have been in violation of certain debt agreements due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal absent amendments to certain financial covenants 
on february   we reached an agreement with our primary lenders to amend our debt agreements 
the primary purpose of the amendments was to secure prospective relief under the earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense ratio interest coverage ratio  and to permit the add back of certain cash and non cash charges 
the cash charges relate to modine s recently announced restructuring program  where we are permitted to add back future cash related charges up to a basket limit of million through fiscal we were in compliance with all amended financial ratios effective december  and march  in connection with these amendments  interest costs increased basis points on the million of private placement notes for the period of april  through june  in addition  we incurred million of amendment fees 
the amended covenants allow the add back of certain non cash charges including the third quarter goodwill impairment charge and the fourth quarter long lived asset impairment charge for our south korean business  and thus to be in compliance with the financial covenants as of december  and march  the amendment to allow the add back of certain cash charges was completed so that the company may conduct the recently announced restructuring actions within the bounds of the financial covenants 

table of contents the prospective relief to the interest coverage ratio provided in the amended agreement was necessary in order for the company to continue to comply with this covenant on a quarterly basis over the next two fiscal years 
we assess our ability to meet the amended interest coverage ratio based on an analysis of the company s fiscal and plans 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis of our fiscal plan against our financial covenants  with particular focus on a quarterly review of the anticipated fiscal results 
this sensitivity analysis identified that we have approximately million to million of quarterly ebit cushion under the interest coverage ratio beginning with the first quarter of fiscal and ending with the fourth quarter of fiscal this quarterly ebit cushion has increased slightly from the million to million cushion projected at the end of the third quarter of fiscal the ongoing achievement of our plan is critical to remaining in compliance with the financial covenants  and we believe that the plan is achievable 
therefore management anticipates that we will remain in compliance with the interest coverage ratio through fiscal  with ongoing compliance thereafter 
the other significant financial covenant included within our debt agreements is a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio leverage ratio 
our ebitda cushion within the leverage ratio is substantially greater than our ebit cushion 
our ongoing ability to remain in compliance with the amended financial covenants assumes a debt level relatively consistent with the march  balance of million 
the company believes that this is an achievable assumption based on the availability of cash provided by operating activities  as well as additional sources of cash 
these additional sources include the million of cash proceeds from the may  sale of our electronics cooling business  as well as potential proceeds to be generated by our portfolio rationalization efforts 
we will continue to tightly manage our anticipated capital spending in fiscal and fiscal  and anticipate this spending  net of potential dispositions  to be near our current depreciation levels 
to the extent that these sources of cash are not sufficient to fully fund our cash requirements  we currently estimate that we could incur additional borrowings averaging approximately million under our domestic unused lines of credit without violating a financial covenant  although this level of borrowing would nearly eliminate our ebit cushion 
on december   the company issued million of percent series a senior notes due in and million of percent series b senior notes due in the proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of borrowings on existing domestic credit lines

investment in r d has increased at an average annual rate of approximately percent since fiscal the company s r d efforts have been focused on new products and technologies to respond to market trends due to environmental legislation as well as to enhance energy efficiency and fuel economy 
these key market drivers are shaping and influencing our customers future thermal management needs 
legislation on nox and particulate emissions for diesel engines continues to provide market opportunities for modine through products such as egr s 
many new heat exchanger and cooling module platforms have been developed in order to help our customers comply with this legislation 
likewise  concern over global warming is continuing to cause the industry to consider replacing current refrigerants such as r a with new  environmentally friendly refrigerants such as co a newly formed vehicular hvac group has grown out of the r d area

critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine s financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
in certain situations  the price increases are recognized as revenue at the time products are shipped in accordance with the contractual arrangements with our customers  but are offset by appropriate provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected 
these provisions are established based on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
there was no provision for estimated commodity price increases at march  at march   we had established million of provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected as the likelihood of collection was uncertain 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other factors indicate a need to perform the testing more often 
the company conducts its annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the third quarter 
the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives was determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives relates 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
to the extent that book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment is recognized 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 
tooling costs pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over the program life or three years  whichever is shorter  and recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
no significant arrangements existed during the years ended march  and where customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 

table of contents pensions and postretirement benefits plans the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine s pension and postretirement plans are dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  rate of compensation increase  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in health care costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  the modine salaried employee pension plan was modified so that no service performed after march  will be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula 
during fiscal  the plan was modified so that no increases in annual earnings after december  will be included in calculating the average annual portion under the pension plan formula 
at the current pension assumption rates  we would expect pension expense to decline steadily going forward 
we believe the defined contribution plan will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses covered by the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and fiscal was percent and percent  respectively 
for fiscal  the company has assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of march for fiscal  the company will use a discount rate of percent  reflecting an increase from percent in fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the health care cost trend rate 
the health care trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company expects this to remain at percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree health care and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
furthermore  beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
a one percent increase in the health care trend rate would result in an increase in postretirement expense of approximately  and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate would result in an increase in benefit expense of approximately  other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of certain contingencies and litigation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  economic risk and commodity price risk 
foreign currency risk modine is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign countries 
modine has manufacturing facilities in brazil  china  mexico  south africa  south korea  india and throughout europe 
it also has equity investments in companies located in france  japan  and china 
modine sells and distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures  distributes and sells its products 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  changes between the dollar and the south korean won and changes between the dollar and the brazilian real 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the company s foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s favorable currency translation adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
as of march  and  the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

table of contents the company has certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

during fiscal  modine korea  llc paid billion won million us equivalent on this inter company loan and the company correspondingly adjusted the zero cost collar to reflect the payment 
at march   the company also had two inter company loans totaling million to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine brazil with various maturity dates through may on june   the company entered into a zero cost collar that expired on march  to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the principal amount of the loans 
this collar was settled on march  for a loss of million reais million us equivalent 
on march   the company entered into a purchased option contract that expires on april  to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the larger million of the two inter company loans 
the smaller inter company loan million will be repaid by february and its foreign exchange exposure will be managed by natural hedges and offsets that exist in the company s operations 
the derivative instruments are not treated as hedges  and accordingly  transaction gains or losses on the derivatives are being recorded in other income net in the consolidated statement of operations and acts to offset any currency movement on the outstanding loan receivable 
the company also has other inter company loans outstanding at march  as follows million loan to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems india  that matures on april   million loan to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems co changzhou  china  that matures on february   and million loan to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems shanghai  that matures on january  these inter company loans are sensitive to movement in foreign exchange rates  and the company does not have any derivative instruments which hedges this exposure 

table of contents interest rate risk modine s interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
the company generally utilizes a mixture of debt maturities together with both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings 
the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivates to manage variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives have been treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and  accordingly  derivative gains or losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the borrowings 
during the years ended march  and  million and million of expense  respectively  was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the amortization of interest rate derivative losses 
at march   million of net unrealized losses remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates including the foreign denominated long term obligations included in the previous table 
the fair value of the long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities 
the book value of the debt approximates fair value  with the exception of the million fixed rate notes  which have a fair value of approximately million at march  as of march   long term debt matures as follows years ending march expected maturity date dollars in thousands f f f f f thereafter total fixed rate won average interest rate fixed rate us dollars average interest rate variable rate us dollars average interest rate credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payment according to contract terms 
the company s principal credit risk consists of outstanding trade receivables 
prior to granting credit  each customer is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  past payment experience and credit information 
after credit is granted the company actively monitors the customer s financial condition and developing business news 
approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated in the company s top ten customers 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
a sustained economic downturn in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations and potentially result in the impairment of related assets 
with respect to international instability  the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
during fiscal there was continued weakening of the us dollar 
the euro and brazilian real strengthened against the dollar by percent and percent  respectively 
the won remained essentially unchanged in fiscal  but strengthened by percent in fiscal the chinese renminbi strengthened almost percent against the us dollar in fiscal and almost percent in fiscal as modine expands its global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 

table of contents the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to exhaust gas recirculation  co and fuel cell technology 
modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets emerge 
the upturn in the economy and continued economic growth in china are putting production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of copper  steel and aluminum fin stock serving a more robust market 
as a result  some suppliers are allocating product among customers  extending lead times or holding supply to the prior year s level 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
historically high commodity pricing  which includes aluminum  copper  nickel and steel is making it increasingly difficult to pass along the full amount of these increases to our customers 
in addition to the purchase of raw materials  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in most instances  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier of such parts being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company offsets this risk with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible but these agreements generally carry annual price down provisions as well 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any one or more of the markets it serves  or a reduction in the company s participation in any one or more markets 
however  the risks associated with any market downturn or reduction are still present 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum  nickel  and natural gas 
the company utilizes an aluminum hedging strategy by entering into fixed price contracts to help offset changing commodity prices 
the company utilizes collars for certain forecasted copper purchases  and also enters into forward contracts for certain forecasted nickel purchases 
the company does maintain agreements with certain customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fluctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a quarter or longer 
hedging and foreign currency exchange contracts the company uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
their use is restricted primarily to hedging assets and obligations already held by modine  and they are used to protect cash flows rather than generate income or engage in speculative activity 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives during fiscal  the company entered into futures contracts related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of aluminum and natural gas 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchase of these commodities 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges by the company 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and natural gas impact earnings 
during the year ended march   million of expense was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
at march   million of unrealized gains remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next nine months 

table of contents during fiscal  the company entered into futures contracts related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of copper and nickel 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchases of these commodities 
the company has not designated these contracts as hedges  therefore gains and losses on these contracts are recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operations 
at march   million of income  was recorded in cost of sales related to these futures contracts 
foreign exchange contracts modine maintains a foreign exchange risk management strategy that uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
modine periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
generally  these contracts have terms of or fewer days 
the effect of this practice is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on modine s earnings 
modine s foreign currency exchange contracts do not subject it to significant risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
as of march   the company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts  with the exception of the purchased option contracts to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the entire amount of the modine korea  llc loan and the million intercompany loan with modine brazil  which are discussed under the section entitled foreign currency risk 
non us dollar financing transactions through intercompany loans or local borrowings in the corresponding currency generally are effective as hedges of long term investments 
the company has a number of investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and non consolidated foreign joint ventures 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility 
from time to time  the company uses non derivative financial instruments to hedge  or offset  this exposure 
interest rate derivatives as further noted above under the section entitled interest rate risk  the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivates to manage the variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives have been treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and  accordingly  derivative gains or losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the borrowings
