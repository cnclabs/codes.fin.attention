comparison to crude oil revenues increased during relative to  due to higher commodity prices as reflected above 
crude oil operating earnings improved with improved end market pricing received from the company s customers relative to crude oil acquisition costs 
operating earnings also improved with a  reduction in operating expenses from the reversal of certain previously recorded accrual items following a negotiated settlement of disputed amounts 
the current year also benefited from crude oil inventory liquidation gains when crude oil prices generally increased during the comparative period 
on january  crude oil prices were in the per barrel range rising to per barrel by december  such price increases produced inventory liquidation gains totaling million during during  crude oil prices fluctuated from periods of increasing prices to periods of decreasing prices with little affect on full year results 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory at an average price of per barrel 
reported natural gas revenues reflect the gross margin on the company s natural gas purchase and resale business and such margins were consistent between the years 
natural gas operating earnings were reduced in relative to due to increased transportation and salary costs 
refined product revenues were reduced in despite increased commodity prices for gasoline and diesel fuel 
the company experienced a thirteen percent reduction in its motor fuel sales volumes for due to a heightened competitive marketplace and weather related reduction in construction demand 
coupled with escalating fuel and wage costs  the competitive picture in produced an operating loss for the company s refined products business 
comparison to crude oil operating earnings were reduced in relative to for a combination of reasons 
first  during the company recognized reduced operating expenses of  due to the reversal of certain previously recorded accrual items following the final true up of the accounting for such items coupled with a  expense reduction resulting from the cash collection of certain previously disputed and fully reserved items 
such items did not recur in second  during  crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range in december to the per barrel range in december producing a gain of approximately  during when the company liquidated relatively lower priced inventory into a higher priced market 
natural gas operating earnings declined to  in compared to  in because the marketplace in offered improved margins due to a tightening of supply 
results for benefited  however  due to increased volumes as shown in the table above 
refined products operating earnings improved to  in over as the company enhanced its capability to deliver biodiesel to the marketplace during a period of strong demand for such product 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparison to demand for the company s liquid chemical truck hauling business was generally sound during  especially as it relates to agricultural chemical product movements 
a slight overall improvement in demand led to increased revenues and operating earnings 
based on the current level of infrastructure  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency when revenues are in the million per year range 
demand for the company s trucking service is closely tied to the domestic petrochemical industry and has generally remained strong with some periodic weakness in recent months 
the company s business is spurred when united states and world economies strengthen coupled with a relatively weak exchange value for the us dollar 
other important factors include levels of competition within the tank truck industry as well as competition from the railroads 
an additional important factor is a current shortage of available qualified drivers which limits the company s ability to expand in its market areas 
comparison to beginning in mid  the company experienced increasing demand for its petrochemical trucking services and such demand remained strong into the fourth quarter of the demand increase boosted comparative revenues by percent in and by additional percent in although revenues increased in  operating earnings were reduced by percent to  this apparent contradictory result was caused by a shortage of available qualified drivers for company owned trucks 
the driver shortage caused the company to sub contract more of its business to truck owner operators  while company owned trucks remained idle 
thus  higher fixed costs such as depreciation were not being absorbed by higher revenues 
the increase in depreciation expense as shown above for resulted from new equipment additions in anticipation of the expanded sales activity 
oil and gas oil and gas division revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices

the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows eaglewood project the eaglewood project area encompasses a ten county area from south texas along the gulf coast and into east texas 
in this area  the company purchased existing d seismic data and reprocessed it using proprietary techniques 
seven wells have been successfully drilled on this project 
one well is currently drilling and two wells are waiting to be completed and placed on line 
there are four more wells planned for the most recent completion was placed on line in late and is producing at the rate of mcf s of gas per day net to the company s working interest in the project 
east texas project beginning in  the company and its partners began acquiring acreage in the east texas area and the company currently holds an interest in approximately  acres in nacogdoches and shelby counties  texas 
seven marginally successful wells were drilled in this area during and the company is optimistic about this area and refinements in exploitation technique continue with five additional wells planned for southwestern arkansas the company is participating in three d seismic surveys in southwestern arkansas covering approximately square miles 
the first of these surveys is complete and an initial well will be drilled in the first quarter of data acquisition on the second survey is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of with the third and largest survey to follow soon after 
south central kansas the company is participating in a large d seismic survey in south central kansas 
data acquisition on this survey will begin in mid assumption parish  louisiana the company participated in a proprietary d seismic survey in assumption parish  louisiana during the data is being processed with first drilling anticipated for late also in assumption parish  the company participated in the reprocessing of an existing d seismic survey and has identified a number of drillable prospects with the first well to spud in late united kingdom north sea in february  the company  together with its joint interest partners  was awarded a promote license in blocks b  b  and d 
the company holds a percent equity interest in these blocks located in the central sector of the north sea 
the company has two years to confirm an exploration prospect and identify a partner to finance  on a promoted basis  the drilling of the first well on the block 
the terms of the license do not include a well commitment 
the company also acquired an approximate nine percent equity interest in a promote licensing right to block b  located in the southern sector of the uk north sea 
oil and gas property sale in may  the company sold its interest in certain louisiana producing oil and gas properties 
sale proceeds totaled million resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of approximately million 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses are increased in due to federally mandated sarbanes oxley compliance costs and certain personnel cost increases 
interest income increased in and due to larger cash balances available during the year for overnight investment coupled with interest earned on insurance related cash deposits 
the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
discontinued operations effective september   the company sold its ownership in its offshore gulf of mexico crude oil gathering pipeline 
the sale was completed to eliminate abandonment obligations and because the company was no longer purchasing crude oil in the affected region 
the pipeline was sold for  in cash  plus assignment of future abandonment obligations 
the company recognized a  pre tax gain from the sale 
the activities for this operation including the gain on sale are included with discontinued operations 
in october  certain oil and gas properties held by the company s chairman and chief executive officer achieved payout status 
this event caused the company to earn a pre tax gain of  for the value of certain residual interests held by the company in the properties 
this gain is non recurring and has been included in discontinued operations for see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook the most significant event of was the oil and gas producing property sale which yielded a pre tax gain of  absent this item  oil and gas operations produced a  operating loss when production volumes declined and dry hole costs and exploration expenses totaling  were incurred 
looking ahead for  additional oil and gas property sales are not currently anticipated 
however  the decline in production volumes is expected to reverse as a number of wells were brought on line in late and favorable drilling efforts continue 
marketing operations exceeded expectation for in large part due to million of inventory liquidation gains as crude oil prices rose during the year 
while recurrence of such gains is not anticipated for  marketing results should remain favorable 
for the transportation operation  operating earnings have remained consistent in the range of to million per year 
while various component parts of the transportation operation have varied over the past four years  overall results remained consistent 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level 
establish oil and gas operating earnings at the million level and replace percent of production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources during  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled   and  respectively 
management generally balances the cash flow requirements of the company s investment activity with available cash generated from operations 
over time  cash utilized for property and equipment additions  tracks with earnings from continuing operations plus the non cash provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
presently  management intends to restrict investment decisions to available cash flow 
significant  if any  additions to debt are not anticipated 
a summary of this relationship follows in thousands years ended december  total net earnings less gain on property sale depreciation  depletion and amortization property and equipment additions cash available for drawn from other uses banking relationships the company s primary bank loan agreement with bank of america provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of one percent

available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  was established at million 
the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base established semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at million as of december  the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
as of december   there was no bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities 
the bank of america loan agreement  among other things  places certain restrictions with respect to additional borrowings and the purchase or sale of assets  as well as requiring the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a to ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities  maintaining a to ratio of pre tax net income to interest expense  and consolidated net worth in excess of  should the company s net worth fall below this threshold  the company may be restricted from payment of additional cash dividends on its common stock 
the company is in compliance with these restrictions 
the company s gulfmark subsidiary maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its crude oil purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility also finances up to million of crude oil inventory and certain accounts receivable associated with crude oil sales 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
as of december   the company had million of eligible borrowing capacity under this facility and no working capital advances were outstanding 
letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
the company s arm subsidiary also maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its natural gas purchasing activities

off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements to provide tractor and trailer equipment for the company s truck fleet 
all such operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
the company has operating lease arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space  and other equipment and facilities

at december   commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows      and thereafter  contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
the company has no capital lease obligations 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases total in addition to its lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas investment activities during  the company invested approximately  for oil and gas projects  of which  was capitalized as additional property with  expensed as exploration costs 
an additional  and  was expended during for equipment additions for the marketing and transportation businesses  respectively 
oil and gas exploration and development efforts continue  and the company plans to invest approximately million toward such projects in  including  of seismic costs to be expensed during the year 
in march  the company expended million to purchase forty four used truck tractor trailer combinations for the purpose of hauling crude oil in the states of michigan  texas and new mexico 
the company also hired additional drivers and such additions will enable the company to expand its crude oil marketing business 
an additional approximate million is projected in for further equipment additions and replacements within the company s marketing and transportation businesses 
insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the areas of worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during  and  insurance cost stabilized and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting as an integral part of its marketing operation  the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
management believes this required accounting  known as mark to market accounting  creates variations in reported earnings and the reported earnings trend 
under mark to market accounting  significant levels of earnings are recognized in the period of contract initiation rather than the period when the service is provided and title passes from supplier to customer 
as it affects the company s operation  management believes mark to market accounting impacts reported earnings and the presentation of financial condition in three important ways 
gross margins  derived from certain aspects of the company s ongoing business  are front ended into the period in which contracts are executed 
meanwhile  personnel and other costs associated with servicing accounts as well as substantially all risks associated with the execution of contracts are incurred during the period of physical product flow and title passage 
mark to market earnings are calculated based on stated contract volumes 
a significant risk associated with the company s business is the conversion of stated contract or planned volumes into actual physical commodity movement volumes without a loss of margin 
again  any planned profit from such commodity contracts is bunched and front ended into one period while the risk of loss associated with the difference between actual versus planned production or usage volumes falls in a subsequent period 
cash flows  by their nature  match physical movements and passage of title 
mark to market accounting  on the other hand  creates a mismatch between reported earnings and cash flows 
this complicates and confuses the picture of stated financial conditions and liquidity 
the company attempts to mitigate the identified risks by only entering into contracts where current market quotes in actively traded  liquid markets are available to determine the fair value of contracts 
in addition  substantially all of the company s forward contracts are less than months in duration 
however  the reader is cautioned to develop a full understanding of how fair value or mark to market accounting creates reported results that differ from those presented under conventional accrual accounting 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changing prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and gas properties 
estimated oil and gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced based on contractually agreed upon terms on an at least monthly basis 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s risk management activities is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company s long term debt facility constitutes floating rate debt 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
because the interest rate on the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value of such debt approximate the carrying value 
the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to one year term with no contracts extending longer than three years in duration 
the company monitors all commitments and positions and endeavors to maintain a balanced portfolio 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected on the company s balance sheet as risk management assets and liabilities 
the revaluation of such contracts is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
current market price quotes from actively traded liquid markets are used to estimate the contracts fair value 
regarding net risk management assets  substantially all of the presented values as of december  and were based on readily available market quotations 
risk management assets and liabilities are classified as short term or long term depending on contract terms 
the estimated future net cash inflow based on year end market prices is  with substantially all to be received in and the estimated future cash inflow approximates the net fair value recorded in the company s risk management assets and liabilities 
the following table illustrates the factors impacting the change in the net value of the company s risk management assets and liabilities for the year ended december  in thousands net fair value on january  activity during cash received from settled contracts net realized loss from prior years contracts net unrealized loss from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from current year contracts net fair value on december  historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
