ethyol is an agent that reduces certain side effects of chemotherapy  and is licensed by southern research institute sri  exclusively to medimmune  inc formerly us bioscience  inc 
pursuant to an agreement between ctt and sri  sri paid us a maximum of  per calendar year from ethyol license income it received 
during fiscal the agreement between sri and medimmune reached its tenth anniversary 
as a result  revenue will be earned at a lower rate in any of the five years following the anniversary to the extent that licensee ethyol sales in any of the next five years exceed the sales generated in the anniversary year

risk factors risks related to our business and the market environment the risk factors described below are not all inclusive 
all risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business  results of operations  and financial position 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements or risk factors 
there may be other risks and uncertainties not highlighted herein that may affect our financial condition and business operations 
certain of our licensed patents have recently expired or will expire in the near future and we may not be able to replace their royalty revenue 
in  we earned retained royalties from licenses for patented technologies 
eight of those patented technologies have or will expire between and those patented technologies represented approximately of our retained royalties in retained royalties of approximately  or   or  and  or  were from patents expiring in fiscal   and  respectively 
the loss of this revenue  especially from the homocysteine assay  will materially and adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to replace it with revenue from other licenses or sources 
since it often takes two or more years for a technology to produce significant revenue  we continuously seek new sources of future revenue 
we derived more than of our retained royalties in fiscal from one technology 
we derived approximately  or  of retained royalties from our homocysteine assay technology 
in fiscal  we derived approximately  or of our retained royalties from this same technology 
the patent for this homocysteine technology expired in july and we will not receive revenue for sales made after that date 
homocysteine revenue in reflects unreported back royalties 
in addition  we are in litigation with carolina liquid chemistries corporation to recover funds that we believe are due us for homocysteine assays kits manufactured  sold or offered for sale in infringement of our patent 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
a concentration of revenue makes our operations vulnerable to patent change or expiration  especially the homocysteine assay  and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position 
sales of our common stock to fusion capital will cause dilution to current shareholders and fusion capital s resale of those shares of common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in july  we entered into an agreement with fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a twenty four month period  subject to certain limitations and extensions 
the purchase price for the common stock to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement fluctuates based on the price of our common stock 
the purchase price per share is equal to the lesser of i the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date or ii the average of the three lowest closing sale prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive trading days prior to the date of a purchase by fusion capital 
pursuant to a registration statement filed with the sec  all shares sold to fusion capital are freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares of common stock purchased from us at any time 
we expect that fusion capital will resell any shares that they purchase over a period of up to twenty four months from the date of the agreement 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares by fusion capital at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares page of our common stock  or the anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price at which we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
there are  shares of our common stock registered for sale to fusion capital  including  commitment shares that were issued on september  to fusion capital and additional commitment shares issuable under the agreement 
through july   we had not sold any shares to fusion capital 
we have the right  but not the obligation  to sell additional shares to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement 
the  registered shares equaled of our outstanding shares of common stock at july  in addition to the  shares that were issued to fusion capital as an initial commitment fee subsequent to july   we may issue an additional  commitment shares to fusion capital as we sell shares to fusion capital 
since july  through october   we sold  shares  and issued commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  and amortized approximately  of deferred charges against capital in excess of par value 
the sale of shares to fusion capital may result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of other holders of our common stock 
the amount of dilution would be higher if the per share market price of our common stock is lower at the time we sell shares to fusion capital  since a lower market price would cause more shares of our common stock to be issued to fusion capital for the same proceeds 
subsequent sales of these shares in the open market by fusion capital may also have the effect of lowering our stock price  thereby increasing the number of shares issuable to them under the common stock purchase agreement and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares 
although we have the right to reduce or suspend sales to fusion capital at any time  our financial condition at the time may require us to waive our right to suspend purchases even if there is a decline in the market price 
furthermore  the dilution caused by the issuance of shares to fusion capital may cause other shareholders to elect to sell their shares of our common stock  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  prospective investors anticipating the downward pressure on the price of our common stock due to the shares available for sale by fusion capital could refrain from purchases or cause sales or short sales in anticipation of a decline of the market price  which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline 
in three of the last five fiscal years  we incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows  and our ability to finance future losses is limited  and may significantly affect existing stockholders 
the table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended july  net income loss      net cash flows from operating activities      investing activities      financing activities     net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents      the company incurred an operating loss for fiscal  as well as operating losses in fiscal and during fiscal  we had a significant concentration of revenues from our homocysteine assay technology 
the patent for this technology expired in july and we will not receive revenues for sales made after that date 
revenue in for the homocysteine technology reflects previously unreported back royalties 
we continue to seek revenue from new technologies or products to mitigate the concentration of revenues  and replace revenues from expiring licenses 
at current reduced spending levels  the company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operating expenses beyond third quarter fiscal these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
page the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs 
if necessary  we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs  and or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies 
the company does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such efforts 
failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the company s financial position 
our current recurring revenue stream is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure 
in and  we were profitable because of unusually large  upfront license fees related to our homocysteine technology that did not recur in  or to return to and sustain profitability  we must increase recurring revenue by successfully licensing technologies with current and long term revenue streams  and continue to build our portfolio of innovative technologies 
we significantly reduced overhead costs with staff reductions across all company departments  reduced extraneous litigations  and obtained new technologies to build revenue 
we will continue to monitor our cost structure  and expect to operate within our generated revenue and cash balances 
in july  to improve our financial condition we entered into an equity financing arrangement with fusion capital for up to million of cash through sales of our common stock  at our option 
the million pursuant to this financing remained available at july  future revenue  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  and enforcing intellectual property rights are subject to many factors beyond our control 
these include technological changes  economic cycles  and our licensees ability to successfully commercialize our technologies 
consequently  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable 
although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock under the fusion capital agreement  and revenue from executing our strategy will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements 
we depend on relationships with inventors to gain access to new technologies and inventions 
if we fail to maintain existing relationships or to develop new relationships  we may have fewer technologies and inventions available to generate revenue 
technology can change rapidly and industry standards continually evolve  often making products obsolete  or resulting in short product lifecycles 
our profitability depends on our licensees ability to adapt to such changes 
we do not invent new technologies or products 
we depend on relationships with universities  corporations  government agencies  research institutions  inventors  and others to provide technology based opportunities that can develop into profitable licenses  and or allow us to share in the profits of distribution 
failure to maintain or develop relationships could adversely affect operating results and financial conditions 
we are dependent upon our clients abilities to develop new technologies  introduce new products  and adapt to technology and economic changes 
we cannot be certain that current or new relationships will provide the volume or quality of technologies necessary to sustain our business 
in some cases  universities and other technology sources may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize technologies 
universities may receive financing for basic research in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize resulting inventions 
these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources  potential clients  to whom we can market our services 
if we are unable to secure new sources of technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we receive most of our revenue from customers over whom we have no control 
we rely on our customers for revenue 
development of new products utilizing our technology involves risk 
many technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts 
our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they encounter in development of commercial products  and usually treat such information as confidential 
their failure to resolve problems may result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
page strong competition within our industry may reduce our client base 
we compete with universities  law firms  venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms 
many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services  and are well established with more financial and human resources than we provide 
this market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area 
from time to time we are involved in lawsuits that historically have involved significant legal expenses 
if the courts or regulatory agencies in these suits or actions decide against us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legal fees and other costs we incurred in relating to the current cases were significant  and the amount of costs we incur in the future may be significant 
for a complete description of all lawsuits in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
our revenue growth depends on our ability to understand the technology requirements of our customers in the context of their markets 
if we fail to understand their technology needs or markets  we limit our ability to meet those needs and generate revenues 
by focusing on the technology needs of our customers  we are better positioned to generate revenue by providing technology solutions 
the market demands of our customers drive our revenue 
the better we understand their markets  the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers technical  commercial  and market requirements and constraints  to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the knowledge  efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel  including john b 
nano  our chairman  president  chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions  and to negotiate and close license agreements 
competition for personnel with the necessary range and depth of experience is intense 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants  especially with our small number of staff  our revenue  financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected 
our customers  and we  depend on government approvals to commercially develop certain licensed products 
commercial development of some licensed patents may require the approval of foreign or domestic governmental regulatory agencies  especially in the life sciences area  and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals 
in the united states  the principal governmental agency involved is the us food and drug administration fda 
the fda s approval process is rigorous  time consuming and costly 
until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval  the licensee may not sell the product in the us  and therefore we will not receive revenue based on us sales 
if we  and our clients  are unable to protect the intellectual property underlying our licenses  or to enforce our patents adequately  we may be unable to develop such licensed patents or technologies successfully 
license revenue is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid  may not be issued upon application  or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents rendering them commercially inadequate 
when all patents underlying a license expire  our revenue from that license ceases  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace it with revenue from new or existing licenses 
page patent litigation has increased  it can be expensive  and may delay or prevent our customers products from entering the market 
our clients and or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products that we believe infringe our patent rights 
for a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
we cannot be certain that our clients and or we will be successful in any litigation or proceeding 
the costs and outcome may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
developing new products  and creating effective commercialization strategies for technologies are subject to inherent risks that include unanticipated delays  unrecoverable expenses  technical problem  and the possibility that development funds will be insufficient 
the occurrence of any one or more of these risks could cause us to abandon or substantially change our technology commercialization strategy 
our success depends upon  among other factors  our clients ability to develop new or improved technologies  and our customers products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large scale production  adapting technologies to satisfy industry standards and consumer expectations and needs  and bringing the product to market before saturation 
they may encounter unanticipated problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in the product launch 
products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions  or commercially viable and competitive 
they may not meet price or other performance objectives when introduced into the marketplace 
any of these events may adversely affect our realization of revenue from new products 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since  and  our board of directors does not currently have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future 
the decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our board of directors based upon factors that they deem relevant  and may change at any time 
as a publicly held company  we have significant administrative costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules implemented by the sec and new listing requirements adopted by the american stock exchange in response to the sarbanes oxley act of  has required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements have increased our legal  audit  financial  compliance and administrative costs  and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly 
the additional costs are expected to continue 
these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance in the future  and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
in developing new products we are affected by patent laws and regulations 
patent laws and regulations are continuously reviewed for possible revision 
we cannot be certain how we will be affected by revisions

employment matters former employee cases pending in september  a former employee filed a whistleblower complaint with osha alleging that the employee had been terminated for engaging in conduct protected under the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
in february  osha found probable cause to support the employee s complaint and ordered reinstatement and payment of damages 
ctt filed objections and requested a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge alj 
based on evidence submitted at the may hearing  in october the alj issued a written decision recommending dismissal of the employee s claim without relief 
the employee then appealed the case to the administrative review board arb 
in march  the arb issued a decision and order of remand  seeking clarification of the alj s analysis of quantum of evidence presented by the employee to sustain the employee s retaliation claim before the alj shifted the burden to ctt to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the employee regardless of protected activity 
the employee has requested consideration of the order of remand based on the board s failure to address the employee s appeal issues  but the arb has not yet ruled on that request 
in august  the same former employee filed a new sox whistleblower complaint with osha alleging that in april ctt and its former general counsel retaliated against the employee for past protected conduct by refusing to consider the employee s new employer for the award of a consulting contract 
in march  osha dismissed the employee s complaint for lack of probable cause 
the employee filed objections and requested de novo review by an alj 
in august  the employee gave notice of intent to terminate proceedings before the alj and remove the case to federal district court 
on september  ctt filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of connecticut against the former employee seeking a declaration that ctt did not violate sox as alleged in the employee s osha complaint  and to recover approximately  that ctt paid to the employee in compliance with a court order that was subsequently vacated by the us court of appeals for the second circuit

overview competitive technologies  inc ctt  was incorporated in delaware in  succeeding an illinois corporation incorporated in ctt and its subsidiaries collectively  we  our  or us  provide distribution  patent and technology transfer  sales and licensing services focusing on the needs of our customers  matching those requirements with commercially viable technology or product solutions 
we develop relationships with universities  companies  inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their intellectual property collectively  the technology or technologies  or to their product 
they become our clients  for whom we find markets to sell or further develop or distribute their technology or product 
we also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies or products 
they become our customers  usually through a license or sublicense  or distribution agreement 
we earn revenues in two ways  from licensing our clients and our own technologies to our customer licensees  and in a business model that allows us to share in the profits of distribution of finished products 
our customers pay us license fees  royalties based on usage of the technology  or per unit fees  and we share that revenue with our clients 
our revenue fluctuates due to changes in revenue of our customers  upfront license fees  new licenses granted  new distribution agreements  expiration of existing licenses or agreements  and or the expiration or economic obsolescence of patents underlying licenses or products 
we acquire rights to commercialize a technology or product on an exclusive or non exclusive basis  worldwide or limited to a specific geographic area 
when we license or sublicense those rights to our customers  we may limit rights to a defined field of use 
technologies can be early  mid  or late stage 
products we evaluate must be a working prototype or finished product 
we establish channel partners based on forging relationships with mutually aligned goals and matching competencies  to deliver solutions that benefit the ultimate end user 
reliance on one revenue source 
in fiscal  we had a significant concentration of revenue from our homocysteine assay technology 
the patent for this technology expired in july and we will not receive revenue for sales made after that date 
homocysteine revenue in reflects unreported back royalties 
we continue to seek revenue from new technology licenses to mitigate the concentration of revenue  and replace revenue from expiring licenses 
we have created a new business model for appropriate technologies that allows us to move beyond our usual royalty arrangement and share in the profits of distribution 
we filed a patent infringement complaint against three suspected infringers  but believe progress in this case may be subject to delaying tactics by the defendants  adding to the normal period of time it takes for such cases to work their way through the court system 
in response to the action we filed  one defendant has requested that the united states patent and trademark office uspto re evaluate the validity of our patent 
re examination proceedings are now underway at the uspto board of appeals 
we do not expect an adverse finding  but completion of such action will delay the ultimate resolution of the case 
further action in this case is pending

presentation all amounts in this item have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars 
all periods discussed in this item relate to our fiscal year ending july  first  second  third and fourth quarters ending october  january  april and july  respectively 
page the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the company incurred an operating loss for fiscal  as well as operating losses in fiscal and during fiscal  we had a significant concentration of revenues from our homocysteine assay technology 
the patent for this technology expired in july and we will not receive revenues for sales made after that date 
revenue in for the homocysteine technology reflects previously unreported back royalties 
we continue to seek revenue from new technologies or products to mitigate the concentration of revenues  and replace revenues from expiring licenses 
at current reduced spending levels  the company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operating expenses beyond third quarter fiscal these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs 
if necessary  we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs  and or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies 
the company does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such efforts 
failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the company s financial position 
results of operations vs 
summary of results we incurred a net loss for of  or per share  compared to a net loss for of  or per share  a decreased loss of  or 
per share 
the reasons for the decrease in net loss are explained in detail below 
our future cash requirements depend on many factors  including operations and sales  outcome and cost of legal proceedings  and equity financing 
to achieve and sustain profitability  we must license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  add new licenses  sign additional distribution agreements  and broaden the base of technologies and products with which we are involved 
some of these factors are subject to activities beyond our control 
although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock under the fusion capital agreement  and revenue from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements 
revenues total revenue for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
retained royalties for were  which was  or lower than the  reported in the following compares revenue from technologies with retained royalties greater than or equal to  in or page increase increase decrease decrease homocysteine assay    sexual dysfunction    wireless fm modulator    plasma display   all other technologies    total retained royalties    during and  we received no upfront fees from new homocysteine licenses granted in the year 
the patent for this technology expired in july and we will not receive revenue for sales made after that date 
homocysteine revenue in reflects unreported back royalties 
approximately of our retained royalties for were from our homocysteine assay technology 
we actively market existing technologies  and seek new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenue and to grow the revenue stream 
we have created a new business model for appropriate technologies that allows us to move beyond our usual royalty arrangement and share in the profits of distribution 
during  we announced an agreement with palatin terminating the license agreement of march  for our sexual dysfunction technology 
as part of the agreement  palatin agreed to pay ctt  ctt recorded revenue of  and reduced patent enforcement expenses by  in accordance with the agreement with our client 
investment income includes dividends and interest earned on our invested cash 
investment income for was  compared to  in a decrease of  or 
the decrease is due to lower average monthly cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year  and significantly lower rates of return earned on invested cash 
product sales for represents sales of our thermal therapy  which we no longer carry  and our electronic stress management and memory improvement product 
for  sales were for the thermal therapy unit only 
other income for was primarily the proceeds of  on the sale of patents related to our video compression technology during the fourth quarter 
it also included a marketing study 
expenses increase increase decrease decrease cost of product sales    personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues    general and administrative expenses    patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements    loss on permanent impairment of available for sale securities   loss on sale of available for sale securities   loss on investment   total expenses    total expenses decreased  or in compared to page cost of product sales in represents costs of our thermal therapy  which we no longer carry 
costs were high relative to revenue because we had sold units at a loss after the decision was made to eliminate this product 
personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased a net  or in  compared to  with decreases in payroll and related benefits of million as a result of reducing full time equivalent headcount  from to a major part of the expenditures in was costs associated with the prior board and management s annual meeting and proxy contest  which triggered the change in control provision in our employee stock option plan 
as a result  all outstanding options vested and we incurred  more in stock option expense in than in we also incurred one time charges in for the write off of  in prepaid royalties related to rfid technology  and commission on the sale of video compression patents of  these savings were offset by  paid in to university of connecticut for the development of an asthma assay 
general and administrative expenses decreased a net  or in  compared to in the company paid million to settle litigation with our current ceo and related legal costs of  including  paid directly to the plaintiff s attorney 
we also incurred over  related to the annual meeting and proxy contest noted above 
in addition  we incurred  in investment banking expenses last year for a contract that was cancelled when the new management took control 
travel and entertainment expenses are lower in by  due to lower headcount and the concerted effort by management to reduce costs 
we incurred a bad debt expense of  in most of this charge   was reversed in as we received payment on disputed homocysteine royalties 
these savings were offset by increases in legal fees of  primarily related to the marcovitch litigation for further information  see item legal proceedings  and costs of  related to the ctt innovation conference 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  decreased a net  or in  compared to  as the result of settling our arbitration proceeding with palatin technologies  inc  whereby we were able to recoup  of incurred legal fees 
ctt retains all rights to the technology commonly known as pt  and is pursuing discussions with parties to develop this technology 
in addition  fujitsu and labcorp litigations were settled prior to fiscal and there has been little activity in the carolina liquids litigation as we await patent reexam results 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
loss on permanent impairment of available for sale securities of  relates to our investment in palatin shares 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we determined that the decline in market value of the palatin shares was other than temporary and wrote the investment down to its fair market value as of october  loss on sale of securities of  relates to the sale of our available for sale palatin and clinuvel securities 
loss on investment 
in april  we invested  in a non public company located in cali  colombia for a ownership  including proprietary technology for converting biomass waste to nutraceutical ingredients  b an option to purchase the remaining ownership and c an exclusive marketing agreement 
during the fourth quarter  it was determined that the technology was not viable and that we had been defrauded 
as a result  the entire investment of  was written off 
we have brought a lawsuit against the non public company  a former ctt director  his former spouse and a former ctt employee to attempt to recover our investment 
for further information  see the marcovitch and federal cases  item legal proceedings 
provision for income taxes in current and prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax amt losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
in and in  we incurred a loss but did not record a benefit since the benefit was fully reserved see below 
the nols are an asset to us if we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a page valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
in and in  the benefit from our net loss was offset completely by a valuation allowance recorded against the asset 
we did not show a benefit for income taxes 
we will reverse the valuation allowance if we have future taxable income 
we have substantial federal and state nols and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
a significant portion of the remaining nols at july   approximately  was derived from income tax deductions related to the stock options exercises 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
we will never receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations 
we adopted the provisions of fin on august  we did not record any unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the implementation of fin at the adoption date  and at july  we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
financial condition and liquidity our liquidity requirements arise principally from our working capital needs  including funds needed to find and obtain new technologies or products  and protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  if necessary 
we fund our liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations  if any  including royalty legal awards 
in addition  we have the ability to fund our requirements through sales of common stock under the fusion capital agreement 
at july   we had no outstanding debt or credit facility 
we believe we will successfully license new technologies and collect due  but unpaid  royalties on existing licenses to add revenue 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts  we believe the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock under the fusion capital agreement  and revenue from executing our strategy will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements 
in fiscal  we will raise cash through sale of stock to fusion capital as needed  provided that our stock price does not drop below 
if necessary  we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs  and or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we pursue licensing opportunities for our remaining portfolio of technologies 
our litigation costs  including the lawsuit against ben marcovitch  should have future costs at greatly reduced levels than what is reflected in our statement of operations through july  in late fiscal  we obtained exclusive worldwide distribution rights to a non invasive pain management therapy device for rapid treatment of high intensity oncologic and neuropathic pain  including pain resistant to morphine and other drugs 
developed in italy by ctt s client  prof 
giuseppe marineo  dsc  md  the technology was brought to ctt through the efforts of prof 
giancarlo elia valori of the italian business development group  sviluppo lazio spa  and assistance from the zangani investor community tm 
the unit  with a biophysical rather than a biochemical approach  uses a multi processor able to simultaneously treat multiple pain areas by applying surface electrodes to the skin 
the device s european ce mark certification allows it to be distributed and sold throughout europe  and makes it eligible for approval for distribution and sales in multiple global markets 
a us patent has been applied for  and ctt is working with the fda for k authorization for us sales of the device 
several thousand patients in various hospitals have been successfully treated using the technology 
ctt partner geomc co  ltd 
of korea is manufacturing the product commercially for worldwide distribution 
in fiscal  distribution agreements granted country exclusive rights to excel life sciences  inc for india 
subsequent agreements have granted country exclusive rights to biogene pharma limited for bangladesh  and to geomc co  ltd 
for korea 
each of these companies is obtaining local sales authorization 
cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and interest earning investments with maturities of three months or less  including overnight bank deposits and money market funds 
we carry cash equivalents at cost 
at july   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at july  the fiscal loss of  contained non cash charges of  and reduction in assets and liabilities of  resulting in cash used in operations of  cash flow provided by investing activities includes proceeds of  primarily from the sale of available for sale securities 
these activities reduced cash by  as of october   our cash and cash equivalents balance is approximately million 
page we currently have the benefit of using a portion of our accumulated nols to eliminate any future regular federal and state income tax liabilities 
we will continue to receive this benefit until we have utilized all of our nols  federal and state 
however  we cannot determine when and if we will be profitable and utilize the benefit of the remaining nols before they expire 
funding and capital requirements equity financing on july   we entered into an agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a month period the agreement 
we have the right to determine the timing and the amount of stock sold  if any  to fusion capital 
under the terms of the agreement  we subsequently issued  registered shares of our common stock to fusion capital for its initial commitment the initial commitment shares  and agreed to issue  additional commitment shares the additional commitment shares to fusion capital on a pro rata basis as we sell the million of stock collectively  the commitment shares 
commencement of sales of common stock under the agreement was contingent upon certain conditions  principally the securities and exchange commission sec declaring effective our registration statement filed with the sec to register  shares of common stock potentially to be issued under the agreement 
on september   the sec declared our registration statement effective 
subject to our right at any time to suspend sales of our common stock or to terminate the agreement  fusion capital is obligated to purchase up to  of our common stock each three business days the base purchase amount 
no sales will be made below a per share floor price 
the sale price per share will be the lower of the lowest sales price on the sale date or an average of the three lowest closing prices during the consecutive trading days prior to the sale date 
fusion capital may not purchase shares of our common stock under the agreement if fusion capital would beneficially own in excess of of our common stock outstanding at the time of purchase 
fusion capital has agreed not to sell the commitment shares for months or termination of the agreement 
we incurred cash costs relating to the completion of the agreement  including professional fees  listing fees and due diligence costs 
we also incurred noncash costs for the estimated fair value of the initial shares of  we have capitalized all of the cash and noncash costs  aggregating  as deferred financing costs  and will charge them against capital in excess of par value on a pro rata basis as we sell shares to fusion capital  based upon the ratio of the proceeds received compared to our estimate of the total proceeds to be received over the life of the agreement 
since july  through october   we sold  shares  and issued commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  and amortized approximately  of deferred charges against capital in excess of par value 
capital requirements the company incurred an operating loss for fiscal and in fiscal  we had a significant concentration of revenues from our homocysteine assay technology 
the patent for this technology expired in july and we will not receive revenue for sales made after that date 
homocysteine revenue in reflects unreported back royalties 
we continue to seek revenue from new technology licenses to mitigate the concentration of revenue  and replace revenue from expiring licenses 
we have created a new business model for appropriate technologies that allows us to move beyond our usual royalty arrangement and share in the profits of distribution 
for fiscal  we expect our capital expenditures to be less than  page general our future cash requirements depend on many factors  including results of our operations and marketing efforts  results and costs of our legal proceedings  and our equity financing 
to achieve and sustain profitability  we must increase the number of distributors for our products  broaden the base of technologies for distribution  license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  and add new licenses 
obtaining rights to new technologies  granting rights to licensees and distributors  enforcing intellectual property rights  and collecting revenue are subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock under the fusion capital agreement  and revenue from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements 
contractual obligations and contingencies at july   our contractual obligations were more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations  principally rent      nano employment agreement  any other commitments we may have are contingent upon a future event 
contingencies 
our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we seek to limit and reduce potential obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance  subject to deductibles 
we also carry liability insurance  casualty insurance  for owned or leased tangible assets  and other insurance as needed to cover us against potential and actual claims and lawsuits that occur in the ordinary course of business 
many of our license and service agreements provide that upfront license fees  license fees and or royalties we receive are applied against amounts that our clients or we have incurred for patent application  prosecution  issuance and maintenance costs 
we expense such costs as incurred  and reduce expense if reimbursed from future fees and or royalties 
if the reimbursement belongs to our client  we record no revenue or expense 
as of july   ctt and its majority owned subsidiary  vector vision  inc vvi  have remaining obligations  contingent upon receipt of certain revenues  to repay up to  and  respectively  in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt also is obligated to pay at the rate of of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay at rates of of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
we recognize these obligations only if we receive revenues related to the grant funds 
we recognized approximately  of these obligations in we engage independent consultants who provide us with business development  consulting and or evaluation services under contracts that are cancelable on certain written notice 
these contracts include contingencies for potential incentive compensation earned solely on sales resulting directly from the work of the consultant 
we have neither accrued nor paid significant incentive compensation under such contracts in fiscal or for the year ended july   we paid  under such contract 
for the year ended july   we neither accrued nor paid incentive compensation under such contracts 
page critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on information available at the time  and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
by their nature  estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to change at any time  and may depend on factors we cannot control 
as a result  if future events differ from our estimates  assumptions and judgments  we may need to adjust or revise them in later periods 
we believe the following significant estimates  assumptions and judgments we used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our financial condition and operations 
deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of uncertainty of achieving sufficient taxable income in the future  a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset has been recorded 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to reverse the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which could result in additional income tax income 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation on a fair value basis 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including  estimating the expected life of the stock option  volatility  and the amount of stock based awards that can be expected to be forfeited 
our estimates were based on our historical experience with stock option awards 
deferred equity financing costs 
we have incurred cash costs relating to the completion of the agreement  including professional fees  listing fees and due diligence costs 
we have capitalized all of the cash costs  aggregating  as deferred financing costs which have been included as other long term assets at july   and will charge them against capital in excess of par value on a pro rata basis as we sell shares to fusion capital  based upon the ratio of the proceeds received compared to our estimate of the total proceeds to be received over the life of the agreement 
we currently estimate that we will sell million of common stock to fusion capital pursuant to the agreement 
related party transactions our board of directors determined that when a director s services are outside the normal duties of a director  we compensate the director at the rate of  per day  plus expenses  which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one day board meeting 
we classify these amounts as consulting expenses  included in personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues 
we incurred charges of  and  in and  respectively  for consulting services provided by a relative of our president and ceo
