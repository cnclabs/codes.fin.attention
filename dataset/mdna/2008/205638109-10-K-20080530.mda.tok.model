the decrease in contribution margin for compared to was due to a disproportionate percentage decline in revenue compared to costs 
the percentage decline in revenue exceeded the percentage decline in costs due to annual salary increases and higher costs associated with certain fixed price projects partially offsetting the reductions in compensation costs associated with headcount reductions in the decrease in contribution margin for compared to was primarily due to an increase in subcontractor costs within our european operations related to projects that require specialized skill sets

we also recorded income tax benefits of million during fiscal related to the settlement of prior year tax matters with the irs as we concluded two separate competent authority proceedings resulting in a reduction to our income tax provision approximately million and reached settlement on taxes associated with our domestic operations  most notably the us research and experimentation tax credit 
for additional information regarding the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate for fiscal  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
restructuring charge restructuring initiative during fiscal  we undertook various restructuring initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a number of our critical business processes  primarily within the products segment 
these initiatives included the realignment and centralization of certain product development activities leading to the full or partial closing of certain development labs and termination of approximately employees  primarily programming personnel 
we also terminated approximately employees from various other functions of the organization  primarily within sales and marketing 
these activities resulted in a restructuring charge of million for fiscal our restructuring and other actions are expected to reduce costs by approximately million on an annualized basis before taking into consideration any increased expenditures we may incur related to our compuware initiative see item business of this report for more details related to compuware 
substantially all costs related to the fiscal restructuring initiatives have been expensed as of march  we continue to review the impact of these actions and will  based on future results of operations  determine if additional actions are needed 
the total amount of any potential future charges for such actions will depend upon the nature  timing and extent of those actions 
restructuring initiative in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for changes in the restructuring accrual for  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
future events or inaccuracies in reported credit data that result in a change to collectibility expectations could have a negative effect on our operating results 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statement of position software revenue recognition and modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin and emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg  maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe of fair value for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe of fair value can be established 
when maintenance or services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or over the period in which the services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include term licenses as we do not sell maintenance for term licenses separately and therefore cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements in these arrangements 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate recognition of the software license fees  maintenance fees and as applicable  professional services fees under sop as amended 
however  to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue based on its determination of fair value 
we apply our vsoe of fair value for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and stand alone services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 
we have an increasing need for flexibility in licensing rights and offerings to our customers 
as our contractual arrangements evolve to meet the needs of our customers  an increasing percentage of our license arrangements must be recognized over the terms of the arrangement 
while this ratable recognition has no impact on our results over time  it may change the timing of forecasted revenue and impact quarterly and annual results 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been delivered to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
license revenue associated with term transactions is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for development services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and if determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
certain engagements involve a project to setup the customer s structure and provide on going support for the project 
revenue associated with these projects is recognized over the service period as the customer derives value from the services  consistent with the proportional performance method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for the collection and credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product which is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
we measure the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill associated with such reporting unit must be further evaluated for impairment 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg  economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
investments in partially owned company as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we have a minority investment in and advances to caretech solutions  inc caretech  a privately held company that provides information technology outsourcing to healthcare organizations 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of caretech to assess potential impairment in the carrying value of our investments in and advances to this entity 
we consider their current financial situation  including their ability to meet current cash requirements  expected future cash flows and any other information known to us in determining whether an impairment charge is appropriate 
unknown factors or unforeseen events that impair their ability to pay their obligations or to operate profitably could have an impact on our ability to recoup our investments in and outstanding advances to caretech and could require us to expense all or a portion of the outstanding investments and advances in that period 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin effective april  we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
the expense for unvested stock options at april  is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the expense for all awards granted after april  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate of on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
for sfas r calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in was per option share 
if we increased the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march  and  cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities during was million  an increase of million from the increase was due to lower payroll and vendor related disbursements of approximately million primarily resulting from the net operating cost savings achieved through our restructuring initiatives see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report and a reduction of million in income tax payments in compared to the increase was partially offset by a decrease in investment interest income received during resulting from a lower average cash equivalent and investment balance in as we continue to use funds to repurchase our common shares 
the consolidated statements of cash flows included in item of this report computes net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue have typically had the largest impact on the reconciliation of net income to compute cash flows from operating activities as we allow for deferred payment terms on multi year products contracts 
the decrease in the net change of accounts receivable of million and the increase in the net change of deferred revenue of million from as compared to are primarily due to an increase in multi year products deals 
other significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities were as follows increase in the net change of accounts payable and accrued expenses of million from as compared to  primarily due to the reversal of the income tax reserve in fiscal related to the settlement of previous years open tax issues with the irs and the increase in bonus and commission accruals  the gain on sale of foresee results  inc of million that was realized in the cash proceeds were included in our investing activities during  and impairment charges for property and equipment and capitalized software of million recorded in as of march   million was accrued related to restructuring actions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we continue to review the impact of these actions and will  based on future results of operations  determine if additional actions are needed 
the total amount of any potential future charges for such actions will depend upon the nature  timing and extent of those actions 
we believe our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by investing activities cash provided by investing activities during was million  an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to a million decline in the amount of cash used to acquire businesses during compared to partially offset by million of cash received in for the sale of our former headquarters building and the sale of our investment in foresee results  inc see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report for more details

we intend to continue repurchasing shares under the discretionary plan  funded primarily through our operating cash flow and  if needed  funds from our new credit facility 
our long term goal is to reduce our outstanding common share count to approximately million shares 
we do not anticipate any significant changes in our approach to the repurchase program 
the maximum amount of repurchase activity under the discretionary plan  excluding block purchases and negotiated transactions  continues to be limited on a daily basis to of the average trading volume of our common stock for the previous four week period 
in addition  no purchases are made during our self imposed trading black out periods in which the company and our insiders are prohibited from trading in our common shares 
our standard quarterly black out period commences fifteen days prior to the end of each quarter and terminates the day following the public release of our earnings 
under the b plan  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of million shares of our common stock  subject to price  volume and timing constraints set forth in the plan pursuant to rule b c of the securities exchange act of through september  a broker selected by us had the authority to repurchase shares on our behalf under the terms and limitations specified in the plan without our discretion  allowing repurchase activity to continue at times when we might otherwise be prevented from repurchasing shares under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading black out periods 
during  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate million and settled an additional million of trades that occurred during the fourth quarter of under the b plan 
in august the b plan was terminated

the new credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million and expires on november  the new credit facility also permits us to increase the facility by million  subject to receiving additional commitments from lenders and certain other conditions 
the new facility also limits additional borrowing outside of the facility to million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for a description of the material terms of the new credit facility 
the new credit facility replaces a million revolving credit facility that matured on october  no borrowings have occurred under the new credit facility or the previous facility since inception

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained on its merits if audited and challenged 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
in fiscal  we adopted fin and recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to manage the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statements of operations to fluctuations in interest rates

we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and  are due in fiscal through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million and million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated million and million positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets 
we also have non us subsidiaries with financial instruments that are not denominated in their reporting currency 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss of a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
