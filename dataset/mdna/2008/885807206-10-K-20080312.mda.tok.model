item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs targeting the microenvironment of solid tumors as novel treatments for patients with cancer 
the microenvironment of solid tumors is characterized by  among other things  hypoxia or lack of oxygen disordered angiogenesis and the upregulation of glucose transport 
this hypoxic environment is known to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation 
it is thought to be responsible for the poor prognosis of many solid tumors and treating the hypoxic environment is currently believed to be a significant unmet medical need 
our product candidates are designed to selectively target the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors either by selective toxin activation in the case of our hypoxia activated prodrug hap program  including th  or potentially utilizing the consequences of increased uptake of glucose in cancer cells relative to most normal cells 
our product candidates  glufosfamide and deoxyglucose dg  share certain structural characteristics with glucose but act instead as chemotherapeutic toxins when taken up by a cell 
our clinical focus is on product candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer 
we have three product candidates for which we have exclusive worldwide marketing rights th  which was discovered by threshold  is our lead product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
it is a novel drug candidate that is activated under the severe hypoxic conditions typical of essentially all solid tumors 
in may  we announced the filing of an investigational new drug application ind with the fda for th  and in july  we initiated a phase clinical trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of th in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we expect to present top line results for this clinical trial by q and complete enrollment by q glufosfamide is our most advanced product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
in february  we announced that our phase clinical trial did not reach its primary endpoint of a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that relapsed following chemotherapy with gemcitabine 
in july  we completed enrollment in the phase stage of a clinical trial of glufosfamide plus gemcitabine for the first line treatment of pancreatic cancer  for which top line results were announced in december and final results  which included promising tumor response and survival data  were announced in third quarter of in we initiated a phase clinical trial of glufosfamide in soft tissue sarcoma and in january  we announced that enrollment was complete and that the clinical trial provided evidence of clinical activity 
in we also initiated two phase clinical trials of glufosfamide in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and recurrent sensitive small cell lung cancer 
in october and january  we announced the discontinuation of enrollment in the phase trials of glufosfamide in recurrent sensitive small cell lung cancer and platinum resistant ovarian cancer  respectively  due to lack of efficacy 
dg is our product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer and is being evaluated in a phase clinical trial alone and in combination with docetaxel as a combination therapy 
this clinical trial began in the first quarter of and we expect to complete enrollment and present top line results for this clinical trial in q 
table of contents we are working to discover additional novel drug candidates  particularly hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 
we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates  and  prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the net loss for was million and the cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
in october   we adopted a plan to reduce our operating expenses and refocus our research and development efforts 
the plan included eliminating positions  or approximately a reduction in staff affecting all areas of the company 
as a result of the staffing reduction we incurred severance benefits of approximately million in the fourth quarter of annual cash savings from the reduction in salary and benefit expenses are estimated to be approximately million  beginning in we expect to continue to incur losses from operations in the future 
we expect that expenses will decrease in compared to due to a reduced workforce and reduced number of patients in smaller and fewer clinical trials  and that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through the first quarter of  including completing our current and planned clinical trials and conducting research and discovery efforts toward additional product candidates 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
see detailed discussion in liquidity and capital resources regarding raising capital for funding future operations beyond the first quarter of revenue we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates in the near term 
through  we recognized million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic co  ltd  or medibic  for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to continue through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will decrease significantly in the future as we progress with a reduced workforce and smaller clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation prior to january   we used the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

for stock options granted to employees no compensation expense was recognized unless the exercise price was less than fair market value at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense was recognized under apb no 
for options granted prior to the company s initial public offering of its common stock in february based upon the intrinsic value the difference between the exercise price at the date of grant and the deemed fair value of the common stock based on the anticipated initial public offering stock price 
in anticipation of our initial public offering which was completed in february  we determined that  for accounting purposes  the deemed fair value of our common stock was greater than the exercise price for certain options 
as a result  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for these options of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this expense  which is a non cash charge  has been amortized over the period in which the options vest  which is generally four years 
the amortization of this expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
beginning january   we began accounting for stock based compensation using the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
share based payment 
an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r  issued by the financial accounting standards board in december refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses is due to a million decrease in clinical and development expenses and million in lower staffing and facilities expenses due to a lower headcount compared to the prior year 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and consultants compared to the prior year  as well as lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 

table of contents research and development expenses by project in thousands years ended december  glufosfamide th dg discovery research th total research and development expenses research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decrease was due to a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing expenses and a million decrease in staffing expenses 
research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for  primarily due to the compound s progress through preclinical studies towards the ind filing in april and commencement of the phase clinical trial in july research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  due to million decrease in employee related expenses and a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing as the phase clinical trial nears completion 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to the allocation of resources towards our th program  and lower staffing and facilities expenses to support our other discovery research programs 
research and development expenses associated with th were  for and million for this decrease in expenses was due to costs associated with fully enrolled clinical trials in the period  followed by the discontinuation and close out of the program beginning in july for  we incurred expenses less than previous estimated accruals 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in compared to due to smaller and fewer clinical trials and a reduced workforce 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million in lower staffing expense  million decrease in stock based compensation  and million in lower consulting expenses 
these reductions in expenses were partially offset by million in higher facilities expense 
we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to lower employee related costs as a result of staff reductions 
interest and other income interest and other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during compared to the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses and million in higher staffing and facilities expenses  including million in severance expense related to staff reductions 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a million decrease in non employee stock based compensation expense and amortization of our deferred stock compensation charge partially offset by a million increase in employee stock based compensation as result of our adoption of sfas r beginning january  research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for the and million for this increase is due to a million increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses and a million increase in staffing expenses 
research and development expenses associated with th were million for and million for the this increase in expenses was due to an increase of million in expenses associated with our phase united states clinical trial initiated in june and our eu phase clinical trial initiated in august 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower stock based compensation and staffing expenses for the th project 
research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million in  as the compound progressed through preclinical studies 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for this decline was primarily due to lower clinical expenses 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the million increase was primarily due to increases in staffing costs to support expansion of our discovery research programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million increase reflects million increase in staffing expenses including million in severance expense related to staff reductions  an increase in stock based compensation expenses of million primarily due to the adoption of sfas r and additional expenses associated with being a public company 
interest and other income interest income for was million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher invested cash balances and higher average interest rates during compared to the prior year due to proceeds received from our follow on offering completed in october interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and  respectively  reflecting the increase in the balance of our note payable due to million of borrowing in against our amended loan and security agreement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses since inception through december  of million 
we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of product candidates in the near term 
from inception until our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  raising net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses  a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations resulted from the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses and deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations resulted from the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  additional accruals for clinical and development expenses and personnel related expenses  depreciation expense and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively  capital spending of million and million in and  respectively  partially offset by sales of marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to repayments of notes payable during the year partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to borrowings under a loan and security agreement  net of repayments and to lesser extent cash from stock option exercises and sale stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily from the two public offerings completed during the year our initial public offering that was completed in february and raised million of net proceeds  and our follow on offering that was completed in october and raised million of net proceeds 
we expect cash requirements to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through the first quarter of  including completing our current and planned trials  conducting research and discovery efforts towards additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we intend to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we expect to need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our future operations 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  
table of contents collaborative arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq global market 
on october   we received a notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market indicating that the company does not comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a 
the notice further stated that pursuant to marketplace rule e  we will be provided calendar days  or until april  to regain compliance 
if  at any time before april   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive business days  and if we remain in compliance with other listing requirements  nasdaq will notify the company that we have regained compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rules 
nasdaq may  in its sole discretion  require the company to maintain a closing bid price of at least per share for a longer period before determining that the company has demonstrated the ability to maintain long term compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
the notice further indicates that if compliance with the minimum bid price rule is not regained by april   nasdaq will provide written notification that our common stock will be delisted 
at that time we may appeal the nasdaq s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
alternatively  we may apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq capital market if we satisfy the requirements for initial inclusion set forth in marketplace rule c  other than the minimum bid price requirement of marketplace rule c 
if the application is approved  we will be afforded the remainder of a second additional day compliance period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule while on the nasdaq capital market 
we will continue to monitor the bid price for our common stock and consider various options available to us if our common stock does not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance 
to maintain our listing on the nasdaq global market  we are also required  among other things  to either maintain stockholders equity of at least million or a market value of at least million 
while we currently satisfy the stockholders equity requirement  we may not continue to do so 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million for working capital and equipment purchases 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount under this facility  which is being repaid over a month period from the dates of borrowing 
these borrowings bear interest at an average rate of per year at december  at december   all 
table of contents borrowing under this facility had been fully repaid 
in april  we amended the existing loan and security agreement to borrow up to an additional million for working capital and equipment purchases 
the interest rate for borrowings under this facility will be determined based on the month us treasury note plus on the date of borrowing 
we borrowed million under this facility  which will be repaid over a month period from the date of borrowing 
the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
at december   the total amount due under this facility was million 
we may borrow up to an additional million for equipment purchases 
the amended agreement requires us to maintain the lower of of our total cash and cash equivalents or million at the financial institution 
at december   we were in compliance with this covenant 
in august  we entered into a noncancelable facilities sublease agreement that expires on february  for our headquarters in redwood city  california 
on april   we entered into a noncancelable facilities lease agreement that expires on february  for additional laboratory space in redwood city  california 
in february  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of space and increased the lease term for the existing space located at our headquarters in redwood city  california to september  the lease is for a period of months  beginning on april  with respect to the additional square footage and will begin on march  with respect to the existing square footage 
the lease will expire  unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the lease  on september  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs and expenses associated with the premises as well as a customary management fee 
we are also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the lease  we furnished a letter of credit to the landlord for approximately million 
our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our financing and lease agreements  and purchase commitments 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december   are as follows in thousands within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total facilities sublease and lease notes payable  principal and interest purchase commitments total in november  we entered into an agreement with medibic to develop glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries  and received an upfront payment of million contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan 
in july  we finalized the development plan with medibic and began recognizing revenue from the upfront payment on a straight line basis over the development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
we will also be required to make royalty payments upon product commercialization 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by making certain payments ranging from million to million  depending on the stage of development of the glufosfamide product in japan 
in august  we entered into an agreement with baxter international and baxter healthcare sa  together baxter  for the licensing and development of glufosfamide 
under this agreement  we paid baxter an upfront license fee of million and a million development milestone in we also made a 
table of contents development milestone payment of million in november and we are obligated to make certain additional development milestone payments  with the next payment due in connection with the filing of a new drug application with the fda for glufosfamide 
we will be required to make a milestone payment of million within days of filing an nda for glufosfamide with the fda 
future milestone payments in connection with the development of glufosfamide and united states and foreign regulatory submissions could total up to million  and sales based milestone payments could total up to million 
following regulatory approval  we will be obligated to pay up to mid single digit royalties to baxter based on sales of glufosfamide products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make development or sales based milestone or royalty payments to baxter 
under our license agreement with dr 
theodore j 
lampidis and dr 
waldemar priebe for rights under a patent and certain patent applications that generally cover the treatment of cancer with dg in combination with certain other cancer drugs  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments  including milestone payments of up to million in connection with the filing and approval of an nda for the first product covered by the licensed patents  as well as royalties based on sales of such products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make these milestone or royalty payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in through the california state research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ 
table of contents from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of our common stock for options granted through the date of the initial public offering in february was originally estimated by our board of directors  with input from management 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist 
subsequently  we reassessed the valuations of common stock relating to grants of options during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and as disclosed more fully in note of the notes of our consolidated financial statements  we granted stock options and restricted common stock with exercise prices ranging from to per share during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and in addition  we determined that the fair value of our common stock increased from to per share during that period 
for financial reporting purposes  we have recorded stock based compensation representing the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded before our initial public offering in february  we determined the estimated fair value based upon several factors  including significant milestones attained  sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  changes in valuations of existing comparable publicly registered biotech companies  trends in the broad market for biotechnology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
although it was reasonable to expect that the completion of our initial public offering would add value to the shares as a result of increased liquidity and marketability  the amount of additional value could not be measured with precision or certainty 
we amortize employee stock based compensation on a straight line basis for equity instruments subject to fixed accounting 
we amortize employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans for equity instruments subject to variable accounting 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the two factors 
table of contents which most affect these changes are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each clinical trial and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified consensus eitf issue no 
accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf  which concluded that non refundable advance payments for goods or services for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
eitf is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measures sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  the fasb anticipates that for some entities  the application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for financial statements in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements

the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
