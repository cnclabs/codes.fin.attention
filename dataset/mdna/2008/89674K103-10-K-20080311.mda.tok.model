item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
our focus is on the specialized expertise  materials and know how of rf and other high and intermediate frequency applications 
we enjoy diversity in our markets  applications  products  technology and customer base 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates including compound semiconductor materials such as gaas and piezoelectric crystals such as litao we use a variety of process technologies using gaas substrates including hbt and phemt 
using various other substrates we also manufacture saw and baw products 
using these materials and our proprietary technology  we believe our products can overcome the performance barriers of competing devices in a variety of applications and offer other key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  higher power and power added efficiency  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at higher levels of performance than silicon devices 
we believe that these advantages our products offer can be a tremendous benefit to our customers  which include major communication companies worldwide 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions to applications in the handset  networks and military markets 
our mission is  connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and military industries 
in the handset market  we provide high performance devices such as rf filters  duplexers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and passive components 
we have also developed integrated rf modules with the goal of maximizing content and minimizing stacked margins  by offering complete module solutions with almost all subcomponents sourced from our own technologies and manufacturing facilities 
in the networks markets  we are a supplier of both active gaas and passive saw components 
we provide the military market with phased array radar antenna components and in were chosen to be the prime contractor on a darpa contract to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gan  a next generation gaas derived technology 
in  we obtained additional funding from the office of naval research to improve manufacturing methods of producing high power  high voltage s band gaas amplifiers 
the semiconductor industry in general was subject to slumping demand and excess capacity from through  however  demand began to grow in and remained strong through wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create a material adverse impact on operating results 
in we began to increase the utilization at our facilities and were able to maintain higher utilization rates through however  we experienced higher than expected yield loss in  primarily due to the qualification of alternative supply sources and planned changes in our product flow to enable growth in future quarters  both of which had a negative impact on our gross margins for the year 
gross margins improved during  particularly during the fourth quarter 
improved plant utilization and manufacturing yields despite a second quarter charge of approximately million for inventory that unexpectedly became excess  largely due to a reduction in demand from a significant customer 

table of contents the handset market had tremendous strength in  continuing a trend that began in we believe the drivers for continued growth in the handset market remain strong as users in developed countries are looking for new features such as digital cameras  video recorders  music players  gps  bluetooth  internet access  mobile television and other video standards  leading to high handset replacement rates 
this transition to more sophisticated handsets increases the rf content in each device  increasing our addressable market 
further  china  india and other emerging countries with improving economies are growing the consumer market by introducing a new customer base 
in the past however  during times of growing demand we have also experienced significant selling price pressure on some of our highest volume products 
the current demand need for increased rf content required for the higher data rates and increased functionality of new handset devices  has allowed average selling prices to stabilize 
however this stabilization may not continue 
in addition  the areas of growth from the emerging countries may be driven by less advanced handsets that do not require the performance and size advantages our products offer 
typical functional price erosion in this market is per year offset by increasing content 
the continued deployment of cellular systems in asia and other emerging markets such as india have driven gsm gprs base station transceiver volumes to new record levels 
however  softness in the cdma infrastructure market coupled with slower than expected demand in wcdma edge have resulted in a flat market for products targeting the traditional cellular base station market 
we expect continued benefit in sales of our point to point radio products  largely resulting from build outs in developing countries and those areas of the world where wireless backhaul systems are prevalent 
our networks market includes products that support the transfer of data at high rates across wireless or wired networks 
our products for this market include those related to bluetooth  wireless lans  wifi  wimax  wibro  catv  microwave radio  cordless telephones  automotive and optical communications 
we also report our multi market standard products in the networks category 
we continue to work on developing lower cost products for our customers however  this may result in flat to lower revenues for an increased number of units 
revenues from the military market are generally for products in large scale programs with long lead times 
once a component has been designed into an end use product for a military application  the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the end use product and as a result  we tend to produce large volumes of these components 
currently  we are actively engaged with multiple military industry contractors in the development of next generation phased array systems and have key design wins in major projects such as the joint strike fighter and f initiatives 
in addition  in we entered into a multi year contract from the darpa to develop high power  wide band amplifiers in gan  and in july  we were awarded a million contract to improve manufacturing methods of producing high power  high voltage s band gaas amplifiers from the office of naval research 
in  we were awarded additional programs 
from darpa  we received a m program to optimize gallium nitride technology for s band 
we also received a m program from the office of naval research to develop v gallium arsenide high power s band amplifiers 
we expect to continue to win government funding for advanced technologies in the future and we expect to participate in other large projects such as the b radar upgrade and hope to expand other programs in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting 
table of contents estimates are made 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  valuation of investments and debt in privately held companies  which impacts net income when we record impairments  valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  and stock based compensation  which impacts cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  reserves for warranty costs and our reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of standard and customer specific products and foundry services in the handset  networks and military markets 
we also receive revenues from non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our handset distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products are recognized when title to the product passes to the buyer 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenues when the customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
revenues from our distributors are recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
our distributor agreements provide for selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve 
further  the distributors are obligated to pay the amount and the price or payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear substantially all of the risks of ownership  the distributors have economic substance  we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale 
we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
sales to our distributors were less than of our total revenues for  and we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons  and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and reserve for such instances 
customers that are not distributors can only return products for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserve for the excess 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the asset and the availability of market data 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
if an asset is written down to fair value  that value becomes the asset s new carrying value and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies in previous years  we made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we held less than of the capital stock or held notes receivable 
in addition  as a result of the sale of our former optoelectronics operations  we received as partial consideration million of preferred stock in cyoptics  inc cyoptics and an unsecured promissory note from cyoptics for million  that was discounted million to reflect the current market rate for similar debt of comparable companies 
we account for all of these investments at cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
during our review  we evaluate the financial condition of the issuer  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the issuer that differ from expectation  could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
on october   we participated in an additional bridge financing where we purchased million of a subordinated convertible promissory note from cyoptics 
the promissory note is an interest bearing note at the rate of per annum 
unpaid principal with unpaid and accrued interest is due and payable at the earlier of i october   or ii event of default as defined in the promissory note or iii at conversion of a qualified equity event as defined in the promissory note 
during  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net 
additionally during  we sold million of assets received from the liquidation of an investment we held in another privately held company including million of intellectual property received from the liquidation 
the intellectual property was held at a zero book value and we recorded a gain for the entire amount of proceeds received 
the remaining assets received from the liquidation of the investment resulted in a gain of less than million 
during  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company and our holdings in the investment were liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of this investment of million 
no impairment was recorded in at december   our investments in privately held companies consisted of our cyoptics investments with a carrying value of million 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved in preparing our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges on foreign entities  merger  acquisition and disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by other factors 
changes could cause management to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed by management for their adequacy and appropriateness 
as of december   we were not under audit by the us income taxing authorities 
we concluded federal income tax audits for the us consolidated tax group on earlier years  most recently for the years and a to german tax audit of our subsidiary  triquint semiconductor gmbh  was completed during the third quarter of no significant adjustments were required as a result of the audit 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the taxing authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
management believes that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
our provision for income taxes as of and for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions years ended december  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for and primarily consisted of domestic and foreign tax liabilities in us and costa rica of million and million  respectively 
in january  we decided to make a million dividend distribution from the costa rica subsidiary 
of the million dividend  the majority was from previously taxed income and the remainder will be taxable in  on which a deferred tax liability was established 
no provision has been made for the u 
s  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are  intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
in the event the costa rican or german subsidiaries remit these earnings to the us parent  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes 
during  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets decreased by million  primarily due to the utilization of the net operating loss against us federal taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recognized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 
due to the lack of a stable earnings history  we will maintain a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in 
table of contents in  our optoelectronics operations were classified as discontinued operations 
during the year  we recorded income from the operations during the period in which we operated it  as well as a gain from the sale of the operations in the second quarter and the sale of the building in the third quarter 
we had net operating losses from prior periods which we applied to these gains to offset the tax impact from these gains 
however  sfas no 
requires the income tax effects related to these transactions be allocated among continuing and discontinued operations and as a result we recorded tax expense on our discontinued operations of million which was offset by a tax benefit recorded on our continuing operations for the same amount 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits upon the adoption of fin as of the date of adoption  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  including interest and penalty of million 
as of december  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  including interest and penalty of million 
the full amount of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate 
stock based compensation on january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  and included stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we accounted for compensation cost related to employee stock options and other forms of employee stock based compensation plans  other than our sawtek employee stock ownership plan  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 we applied financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allowed entities to continue to apply the provision of apb no 
and provide pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
these methods of accounting for stock based compensation involve a number of estimates about the expected lives of stock options  interest rates  stock volatility  and other assumptions as well as the selection of a valuation model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
a change in any of the assumptions used in the model  or the selection of a different option pricing model  could have a material impact on our operations 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for and  included in our consolidated statements of operations in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold stock based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations 
table of contents the table below summarizes our pro forma financial results for  as if stock based compensation had been recognized for these periods utilizing the provisions of sfas no 
disclosures for and are not presented as the stock based compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
r 
in millions  except per share amounts year ended december  net income as reported deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards  net of tax pro forma net loss net income loss per share basic and diluted as reported basic and diluted pro forma on november   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of those employee stock options  excluding option grants to our board members and chief executive officer  with an option price equal to or greater than per share 
as a result of this acceleration  approximately  options with varying remaining vesting schedules were subject to the acceleration provision and became immediately exercisable  subject to our insider trading policy 
the acceleration was done as part of a comprehensive review of our entire benefits program 
the decision to accelerate some of our options was made after review of our current stock price  the competitive standpoint afforded to our company by the options  the benefit of the options to the employees and the potential effects of sfas no 
r 
our stock price was on november   as reported on the nasdaq stock market 
the total pro forma stock based employee compensation expense of million for included approximately million of expense resulting from the november  acceleration 
acquisitions and divestitures agere s optoelectronics business on january   we completed an acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere systems inc  agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
the transaction included the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive optical components  optical amplifiers  optical transceivers and other optical products 
as part of the acquisition  we also assumed operation of the back end assembly and test operations associated with these products at a leased facility in matamoros  mexico 
we acquired this business to expand our market and product offerings in the optical networks market 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that the optoelectronics operations we purchased were not going to meet the revenue projections we made when we initially acquired the operations from agere 
significant reductions in average selling prices combined with reduced demand and valuation for new technologies in the optoelectronic market resulted in continued losses from these operations 
as a result  we announced the sale of these operations on april  and entered into an agreement to sell our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania and our optoelectronics subsidiary in matamoros  mexico to cyoptics 
with the sale  we believe we will benefit from focusing our attention on our growing handset  networks and military markets and build upon our successful portfolio of gaas semiconductor and filter products 
the transaction allowed us to exit our optoelectronics operations that manufactured inp optical components  however  we continued to manufacture and sell gaas based semiconductor products 
table of contents for optoelectronics equipment market produced and originally developed at our oregon and texas facilities 
revenues from gaas products for optical systems accounted for less than our revenues in the sale  completed on april   was an asset sale including the products  manufacturing equipment  inventory  the mexican entity  related intellectual property rights and other assets that constitute the operations that manufacture inp optical chips and components for the optical networking market 
cyoptics paid us the following consideration million cash at closing  million of cyoptics preferred stock and a promissory note in the amount of approximately million  which was recorded net of a million discount to record the note at current market rates 
cyoptics also assumed certain liabilities associated with the optoelectronics operations  such as warranty obligations to customers 
separately  on march   triquint optoelectronics  a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the land and building and related facilities occupied by our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania 
on july   we completed the sale to hamilton tek partners  lp hamilton for million  less commissions  fees  and other costs to sell the facility 
pursuant to the agreement  we assigned to hamilton our lease to cyoptics for approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility 
the lease was executed on april  and was for a period of two years 
peak devices  inc on august   we completed the acquisition of peak devices  inc peak  a privately held  fabless semiconductor company that focused on rf discrete transistor technology 
we paid million in cash on the closing date and paid an additional million of direct acquisition costs during of the million  million is held in escrow for payment of claims and liabilities that may result from this acquisition 
the escrow period expires on december  we are also obligated to pay earnout payments to the former shareholders of peak based on of the gross margin from sales of peak technology based products less a quarterly threshold over a five year period from to these earnout amounts are not contingent on continued employment of the former shareholders 
as of december   we have yet to recognize earnout charges related to the sales of peak technology based products 
we accounted for the peak acquisition as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
details of the purchase price were as follows cash paid at closing acquisition costs total the purchase price was allocated to peak s assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows cash accounts receivables and other assets inventory property  plant and equipment in process research and development intangible assets goodwill payables and other liabilities total 
table of contents the results of operations for the peak business were included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period from september  to december  the intangible assets acquired are being amortized over a weighted average period of six years 
we recorded an additional million of goodwill subsequent to the purchase date for the recognition of an assumed tax liability 
in process research and development ipr d represented peak projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use when acquired but had been developed to a point where there was value associated with them in relation to potential future revenues 
using the income approach to value the ipr d  we determined that million of the purchase price represented purchased in process technology 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately into operating expenses upon the closing date of the acquisition 
the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquire ipr d from the peak acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there were no alternative future uses 
the acquired ipr d consisted of wide band transistor products and was approximately complete as of december  this technology is being integrated into products expected to be completed in there has been no material change in the estimated cost of these projects 
the fair value of ipr d was determined by an income approach  where fair value is the present value of projected net free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over a year period was discounted at a rate of which reflected the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
other factors considered were the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  the useful life of the technology and the profitability levels of the technology 
the estimated net cash flows from these products were based on estimates of related revenues  cost of sales  r d costs  sg a costs  asset requirements and income taxes 
the stage of completion of the products at the date of the acquisition was estimated based on the tasks required to develop the technology into a commercially viable product 
the nature of the efforts to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that we will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the risks associated with ipr d are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit or meet market expectations 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitive product introduction is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
wj communications  inc on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with wj communications  inc  a delaware corporation  and ml acquisition  inc  a delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary 
wj communications is a leading supplier of radio frequency rf solutions for wireless infrastructure  and we expect the acquisition to allow us to expand our reach into the rf market 

table of contents under the terms of the merger agreement  we will acquire by merger all outstanding shares of wj communications for per share in cash 
in addition  all of wj communications stock options will be cancelled for a payment of the per share merger consideration minus the exercise price for the option  and all vested restricted stock and performance accelerated restricted stock units will receive the merger consideration and be cancelled 
all unvested restricted stock and performance accelerated restricted stock units will continue and reflect the right to receive cash equal to the merger consideration when they vest 
the total purchase price will be approximately million 
through the acquisition  we expect to expand our presence in the wireless infrastructure market comprised of cellular base stations and wireless and cable broadband infrastructure 
we anticipate doing this by focusing with wj communications on combining rf power  switching and filtering in cost effective module solutions for base station and other infrastructure applications 
the merger agreement contains certain termination rights and the closing of the merger is subject to the approval of wj communications shareholders  expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and other customary closing conditions 
results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of operations addresses continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the table below sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
however  these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
year ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative in process research and development reduction in workforce impairment of long lived assets loss gain on disposal of equipment acquisition related charges total operating expenses income loss from operations

our overall book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was to this was consistent with the book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  of to our revenues by end market for and are detailed below year ended december  revenues handsets networks military handsets our revenues from products for the handset market increased approximately in  compared to the growth was from increases in revenues from all wireless air interface standards  which we believe reflects an increase in our market share 
our gsm gprs products had the largest revenue dollar increase in as compared to  increasing  while we began to see revenue from our wlan products of million in our wcdma edge products also had strong gains during  as revenues increased as compared to as a percentage of our overall handset revenues in  our gsm gprs revenues continued to be the largest contributor  accounting for of our revenues  as compared to in cdma revenues accounted for of our revenues in  down from in 
table of contents the largest revenue drivers across all standard products for the handset market were our transmit and power amplifier modules  which experienced revenue increases of approximately and  respectively  in as compared to revenues for these products increased as manufacturers sought more integration in the products they purchased 
overall  transmit and power amplifier modules accounted for nearly of our handset revenue in due to our strategic product transition from discrete components to integrated passive and active modules we were able to increase average selling prices by approximately in as compared to networks revenues from the networks products  which include wlan  base station  and various standard products  increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from wlan  point to point radios  and gps products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues for our gsm gprs  wcdma  and cdma x products 
revenues from wlan products increased approximately in as compared to as a percentage of total network revenues  wlan products represented approximately for compared to approximately for military revenues from our military related products increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from our satellite products  which increased over in as compared to as a percentage of our total revenues  military related products decreased to in  from in however  we believe our darpa and office of naval research and future government contracts will help drive our investment in research and development for fundamental technology leadership 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in our revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from asia  india and other developing countries where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us revenues from sales to end user customers in china and korea represented greater than or more of total revenues in  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in  sales to end user customers in china and korea represented or more of revenues and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
gross profit gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor  stock based compensation  and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to non recurring engineering revenues 
in general  we derive a higher gross profit margin on lower volume products for the networks and military markets  such as point to point radios and satellite systems  whereas our handsets products are typically higher volume  more price sensitive and generally have lower margins 
in  our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was as compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of improved capacity utilization and shorter lead times  which produced a higher absorption of fixed overhead costs 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million or  to million  as compared to million in the increase was due to increases in material and supplies  outside services and compensation expense 
as a percentage of revenues our research  development and engineering expenses in were  compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in to million  as compared to million in our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of our increased revenues  as well as increased marketing expenses  labor costs  and depreciation 
as a percentage of revenues our selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of revenues from in in process research and development in process research and development costs of million resulted from the acquisition of peak devices  which was completed on august  no similar charges were incurred in gain on disposal of equipment gains and losses are recorded based upon the disposal price  less the book value of the equipment 
we recorded a loss of million and a gain of million on the disposal of equipment in and  respectively from the sale of equipment at our oregon facility 
acquisition related charges in  we recorded million of charges related to the anticipated tfr earn out payment and retention bonuses  payable in no charges were incurred in interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased million in to million  compared to interest income expense  net of million in the increase is primarily attributable to the pay off of our convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of  which have historically accounted for the majority of our interest expense 
while we utilized a large portion of our cash reserves to retire million of subordinated notes  we expect a reduced periodic interest expense which will positively impact our net interest income going forward 
recovery of impairment investment in other companies in  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company and our holding in the investment was liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of the investment of million 
no impairment or recovery charge was recorded in income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to income tax expense of million in the and tax expense was primarily due to income taxes  penalties and interest from our us and costa rica operations 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues from continuing operations our revenues from continuing operations increased million or to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenues in the handset market  as our transmit module products gained traction with the handset manufacturers as their need for more advanced  integrated products expanded 
significant revenue growth was also seen in our networks market  primarily from our lnas and other products 
we began to see an increase in overall demand for our products in the second quarter of and it continued throughout during each of the quarters of  our revenues increased with the fourth quarter of marking the seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth 
our overall book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was to with our handset market posting the strongest ratio of over to the overall book to bill ratio for the fourth quarter of represented a decrease from our ratio for the quarter ended december   however the december  ratio represented a substantial increase in booking dollars 
our revenues by end market for and are detailed below year ended december  revenues handsets networks military handsets our revenues from products for the wireless handset market increased approximately in  compared to the growth was from increases in revenues from our products from all wireless air interface standards  which we believe was reflected in an increase in our market share 
our gsm gprs products had the largest dollar increase in as compared to  increasing  while our wcdma products had the largest percentage increase in as compared to  increasing from less than million in to over million in our cdma products  which have historically been our largest revenue generator  also had strong gains during  as revenues increased over  as did our wcdma edge products which increased over in as compared to as a percentage of our handset revenue in  our cdma revenues continued to be our largest contributor accounting for of our revenues  as compared to in gsm gprs revenues accounted for of our revenues in  up from in our wcdma edge revenues increased to of our handset revenue in  up from in the largest revenue drivers across all our standards for the handset market were our transmit and power amplifier modules  which experienced revenue increases of approximately and  respectively  in as compared to revenues for these products increased as manufacturers purchased more integrated modules 
overall  transmit and power amplifier modules accounted for nearly of our handset revenues in the total number of units of our wireless handset products we shipped increased in as compared to although the products in our handset segment have lower average selling prices than products in other segments  we increased our average selling price by approximately in as compared to in  the increases in volume and average selling prices resulted in higher gross margins 

table of contents networks revenues from our networks products increased in as compared to the growth in this market was primarily due to strength from our dual low noise amplifier wlan products  combined with our optical devices  cordless phone  gps  broadband wireless application and other standard products 
in addition  the increase was also driven by an increase in revenues from our lna products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our base station if filters 
revenues from point to point radio products remained strong and accounted for approximately of our revenues in  down slightly from in our revenues from gsm gprs edge base station products remained stable in as compared to  and accounted for approximately of our base station revenues in both periods 
however  our cdma and wideband cdma base station product revenues declined approximately in as compared to and accounted for less than of the base station revenues in the decline for cdma products was first evident in from build out softness as evdo build outs in korea  japan and the us were largely completed 
the decline was further affected by the delay of g licensing in china which postponed both cdma and wcdma build outs in that region 
military revenues from our military related products increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from our radar related products  such as our power amplifiers and other products  which increased in as compared to in late  we began to experience increased quoting activity and stronger demand for our passive products than we had seen in prior quarters 
as a percentage of our total revenues  military related products decreased to in  down from in however  the absolute dollar value of our total revenues increased in this segment 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in  compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in our revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from asia  india and other developing countries where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us revenues from sales to end user customers in china and korea represented or more of total revenues in and were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  sales to end user customers in china represented or more of revenues and were approximately million 
gross profit in  our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was as compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of improved capacity utilization and shorter lead times  which produced a higher absorption of fixed overhead costs but was offset in part by the implementation of sfas no 
r which requires us to expense equity compensation 
the gross margin in was negatively impacted by planned changes in our product flow to enable future demand  qualification of alternative suppliers  the production of new products and other factors 
these factors negatively affected our manufacturing yields in  resulting in reduced margins 
research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million or to million  as compared to million in the expenses included stock based compensation costs of million resulting from the adoption of sfas no

our research  development and engineering increased in as compared to  primarily due to the implementation of sfas r

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in to million  as compared to million in our expense in included million of stock based compensation costs resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
our selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to increased sales commissions as a result of our increased revenues  as well as increased marketing expenses  labor costs  depreciation  travel expenses  legal fees and insurance costs 
however  as a percentage of revenues our selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of revenues from in reduction in workforce in  we recorded a charge of million associated with a reduction in force of approximately employees assigned to our operations in apopka  florida and san jose  costa rica 
the charge was a result of our ongoing efforts to align costs and capacity with the reduced levels of production and revenues at these facilities 
we had no similar charges in impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in  we recorded impairments on long lived assets of less than million associated with the write down of certain fabrication equipment held for sale to its fair market value 
there were no impairment charges in gain on disposal of equipment in both and  we recorded gains of million on the disposal of equipment  primarily related to the sale of equipment at our oregon facility 
acquisition related charges in  we recorded million of charges related to the anticipated tfr earn out payment and retention bonuses  payable in the charges related to were million and payments were made in the first and third quarters of interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased million in to interest income expense  net of million  compared to million in this change was attributable to higher interest rates earned on our short and long term investments 
for example  in the average commercial paper interest rate was compared to in we repurchased million of our subordinated debt in the second quarter of which reduced our interest expense in and recovery of impairment impairment charge investment in other companies in  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net 
the reductions in value were determined from analysis of the financial condition of the companies  which had deteriorated  or the reduction in our percentage ownership of the privately held companies in which we had invested 
in  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company and our holding in the 
table of contents investment was liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of this investment of million 
gain on retirement of debt in  we recorded a gain on the retirement of debt resulting from our repurchase of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes 
the repurchases were made at the current market prices resulting in a gain of million  net of the write off of associated capitalized bond issuance costs of less than million 
we had no repurchases of debt in gain on sale of intellectual property in  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of intellectual property acquired from the liquidation of an investment in a privately held company 
the intellectual property was held at a zero book value and we recorded a gain for the entire amount of proceeds received 
we had no similar sales in income tax expense benefit in  we recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of million as compared to an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million in the tax expense was primarily due to income taxes related to our costa rica operations 
the tax benefit in was primarily due to the result of the reduction in the prior year valuation allowance caused by income generated from discontinued operations that was allocated to continuing operations under sfas no 
this tax benefit was partially reduced by tax expenses from our foreign operations in germany  costa rica  sweden and japan 
income loss from discontinued operations we recorded a net gain from discontinued operations of million in  which included a gain of million from the disposal of the operations in the second quarter of and the sale of the facility in the third quarter of  combined with gains on the sale of excess assets of the optoelectronics business of million 
these gains were partially offset by losses from the optoelectronic operations of approximately million and the tax expense from the discontinued operations of million 
the results of the discontinued operations in reflected only four months of full operations as we completed the sale on april  there were no such events in liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities decreased million or to million  from million at december  the net decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities was primarily due to the million repayment of our convertible subordinated notes in february and the million used to acquire peak 
the million of cash provided by operations in represented a million increase from the million of cash provided by operations in the increase in from was due primarily to a million reduction in inventory in versus a million increase in inventory in a factor that negatively affected our operating cash flow in was an increase in our accounts receivable of million as compared to december  at december   our net accounts receivable increased million or to million  from million at december   including million received in our acquisition of peak 
our days sales outstanding as of december  and remained constant at days 

table of contents at december   our net inventory balance decreased million or to million  from million at december   including million received in our acquisition of peak 
this decrease was primarily due to better inventory management as we focused on reducing inventory levels to reduce risk 
at december   our inventory turnover ratio increased to times  as compared to times at december  at december   our net property  plant and equipment balance increased by million or to million  from million at december   including million received in our acquisition of peak 
this increase was due to capital expenditures of million primarily to increase the capacity at our oregon facility and equipment to support new product and technologies at our texas and oregon facilities 
these expenditures were partially offset by depreciation expense of million 
recent transactions affecting liquidity on march   our convertible subordinated notes became due 
on this date we retired the million outstanding notes along with accrued interest payable using our cash reserves 
prior to the march  maturity of the notes  we had repurchased million face value of the original million since their issuance 
on august   we completed the acquisition of peak devices and paid million on the closing date  net of million of cash acquired 
sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  together with cash anticipated to be generated from continuing operations are currently our principal sources of liquidity and we believe these will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditures  for the next months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are capital expenditures or investment needs in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity offerings  debt financings or credit facilities 
a small portion of our cash equivalents at year end were invested in funds that had exposure to sub prime assets  however  were settled for no loss subsequent to year end 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
we currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately million in other significant cash obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments that will affect our future liquidity as of december  total payments due by period in millions less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation other obligations total the amounts presented represent leases of certain equipment  office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides employees who are eligible to participate and the members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their 
table of contents cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are also obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the asset deferred by the participants million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item of our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
the balance represents the pension liability of our german subsidiary  net of the unrealized gain loss on our liability million 
the pension liability becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of the gaas business of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
we have included the reinsurance receivables million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had approximately million in net unrecognized tax liabilities  which are included as long term income tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
while we have considered the impact of this obligation  we generally do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity

we engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments and to hedge material cash flows that are not denominated in us dollars  in accordance with a foreign exchange risk management policy approved by our board of directors 
we primarily use currency forward contracts for this purpose 
this hedging activity will reduce  but may not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements
