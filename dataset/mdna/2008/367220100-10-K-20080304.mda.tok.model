a typical well drilled into these formations may encounter multiple distinct natural gas sands located between approximately  and  feet in depth that are completed using up to ten staged fracs 
during the second quarter of  we spudded our first mancos shale test well and since then we have drilled and completed three wells in the mancos shale 
we are currently completing another well and are awaiting completion on another three 
we continue to focus on reducing our drilling days to improve well economics 
the current target is to days to drill from below surface casing to the upper mancos interval between  feet and  feet 
the fastest mancos well was drilled to  feet in days 
our current plan is for all wells in the riverbend project to be drilled to the upper mancos during during  we spudded gross operated wells net and reached total depth on gross operated wells net 
we also participated in one net outside operated well that was spud and reached total depth during initial completion operations were conducted on operated wells net and one operated well bore was re entered to complete behind pipe pay 
we also participated in the completion of one outside operated well net during as of december   we operated gross producing wells and currently have an inventory of five operated wells awaiting initial completion and wells awaiting uphole completions 
we currently have two drilling rigs under contract  one through april and the other on a well by well basis 
on august   gasco entered into a definitive agreement with a subsidiary of nfr whereby the subsidiary of nfr will participate in a well drilling program in gasco s riverbend project through the second quarter of the terms of the agreement allow for nfr to earn two thirds of gasco s interest in each acre drilling location  feet below total depth drilled  in exchange for paying its share of costs  including a per well location fee paid to gasco as the operator of the project 
the agreement covers substantially all of gasco s drilling program  retroactive for wells drilled year to date  and as such includes gross operated wells spudded net to gasco s interest and net to nfr in at signing  gasco received cash consideration of  for nfr s share of the wells that had been drilled  expected to be drilled and completed or spud prior to agreement date

as a result of the brek acquisition  gasco acquired approximately  net acres in the uinta basin of utah  approximately  net acres in the green river basin of wyoming and additional working interests in ten producing properties in which gasco was already the operator and holds working interests 
the acquisition is expected to simplify gasco s acreage portfolio by absorbing a working interest partner that previously owned approximately of gasco s undeveloped acreage in utah and wyoming 
gasco does not expect to incur any additional overhead expenses as a result of the acquisition 
under the terms of the brek acquisition  a wholly owned subsidiary of gasco merged with and into brek 
as part of the transaction  brek s president and ceo  who owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of brek  agreed to deposit  shares of gasco common stock acquired in the transaction in escrow to satisfy any claims with respect to breaches of representations and warranties of brek for a period of one year following the merger 
in connection with the acquisition  gasco issued  shares of its common stock to brek s shareholders 
the shares of common stock issued to brek shareholders were valued at per share  which was the average value of the company s common stock for two days before and after the merger agreement was signed 
the total purchase price of the brek acquisition was  gasco received approval of its riverbend environmental assessment ea during the approved ea included proposed wells and provided for accelerated permitting approvals from the bureau of land management

greater green river basin project as of december   the company has a leasehold interest in approximately  gross  net acres in the greater green river basin area of wyoming 
the acreage covers two prospects identified by gasco 
during the second quarter of  management believed that the low natural gas prices received in the rockies caused the potential resources related to our wyoming acreage to become uneconomic 
during  we began drilling a well in the muddy creek prospect in wyoming to test natural gas potential in two formations to a proposed depth of  feet 
intermediate casing was set at approximately  feet when drilling operations were suspended due to winter lease stipulations 
the low natural gas prices in this area made it difficult for us to find a partner to participate in the drilling of this well and as a result  management revised its original plans for this well and no longer planned to recommence drilling operations on this well 
therefore the total well costs of approximately  were reclassified from wells in progress into proved property during the second quarter of additionally  approximately 
table of contents  of unproved leasehold costs related to our wyoming acreage was reclassified to proved property during the second quarter of both of these amounts  totaling  were included in the ceiling test and depletion calculations

southern california project the company has a leasehold interest in approximately  gross acres  net acres in kern and san luis obispo counties of southern california 
we continue to pay leasehold rentals and geological expenses to preserve our acreage positions and are marketing these prospects to attract drilling partners for the development of this area 
nevada project the company has a leasehold interest in approximately  gross  net acres in nine prospects within white pine and elko counties nevada 
we have farmed out our acreage to an industry partner for the development of these prospects

present value of discounted future net cash flows differs from the standardized measure of future net cash flows only because the former does not include the effects of estimated future income tax expenses million as of december  
management uses discounted future net cash flows  which is calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses  and the present value thereof as one measure of the value of the company s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes 
we also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways

it has been gasco s experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands 
the company has generally been able to obtain state permits within days  while obtaining federal permits has taken approximately months or longer 
if we are delayed in procuring sufficient drilling permits for our federal properties  we will shift more of our drilling in utah to our state leases 
while such a shift in resources would not necessarily affect the rate of growth of our cash flow  it would result in a slower growth rate of our total proved reserves  because a higher percentage of the wells drilled on the state leases will be drilled on leases to which proved undeveloped reserves may already have been attributed

item legal proceedings in early  a consultant to riverbend gas gathering  llc riverbend  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  that was preparing air emission calculations for possible future capacity expansions  preliminarily determined that riverbend may have not accurately calculated the amount of air pollutants that could be emitted from certain existing equipment at its riverbend compressor station in uintah county  utah 
riverbend thereafter undertook a more detailed assessment  which confirmed that it had not obtained certain air permits nor complied with certain air pollution regulatory programs that were applicable to its operations at the riverbend compressor station 
on june   riverbend sent a letter to the united states environmental protection agency the epa region office in denver  colorado  which because the riverbend compressor station is located in indian country is the agency that has jurisdiction over federal air permitting and air pollution regulatory programs 
the letter voluntarily disclosed the potential violations to the epa and informed the agency of the steps that riverbend had taken and planned to take to achieve compliance 
in november  riverbend met with epa region personnel and discussed the disclosed violations  its plans to bring the riverbend compressor station into compliance  and possible resolution of the disclosed violations 
in a letter to the epa dated january   riverbend confirmed its willingness to sign a consent decree with the united states that resolves the apparent violations  specifies the appropriate corrective action  provides a schedule for riverbend to achieve such corrective action  and includes a covenant not to sue that will effectively authorize riverbend to continue its operations  including certain capacity expansions  while the specified corrective action is being implemented 
riverbend anticipates that such a resolution will be achieved during riverbend believes that all necessary pollution control and other equipment likely to be required by such a resolution is already installed at the site or accounted for in the company s capital budget  and that any civil penalties that may be assessed will not materially affect the company s financial position 
riverbend s emission review also included the gate canyon compressor station  which is a small compressor station operated by riverbend that is located on land over which the state of utah has regulatory jurisdiction 
as a result of this review  riverbend determined that its application for minor new source review authorization from the utah department of environmental quality udeq for the gate canyon compressor station did not include a dehydrator that had been installed at the site 
riverbend has submitted an application to udeq to revise the existing minor new source review authorization to include this equipment 
if any penalties are sought by the state of utah for not having included the equipment in the original application for a minor new source review authorization  the company anticipates that they would not materially affect the company s financial position

overview gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation  development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects  primarily in the rocky mountain region 
the company s business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by using technologies new to a specific area to generate and develop high potential exploitation resources in this area 
our principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights  either directly or indirectly  and the exploitation and development of properties subject to those leases 
the operations of brek are included in our results of operations for all periods subsequent to december  our budget for our capital program reflects our commitment to build upon our historical successes and continue our efforts to demonstrate the economic viability of our resource in the uinta basin of utah 
economic viability of this resource play is a function of the price of natural gas and oil  well investment  well operating cost and well performance 
if we are unable to maintain the reduced capital investment based on recent historical data to drill and complete wells in this area  the estimated well performance based on recent historical performance data in this area is not increased materially or if the prices for oil and gas do not increase from the average prices received during prices we will be unable to economically develop most of our acreage in the uinta basin of utah 

table of contents our budget for our capital program is not contingent upon any material increases in the prices of oil and gas experienced throughout in  we plan to continue to prove the geological model  delineate the resource and demonstrate additional operational efficiencies 
based on historical experience in  we believe that we will be able to continue to demonstrate reduced well investment in through operating efficiencies gained through improved drilling and completion practices  introduction of new technologies and economies of scale 
during  we experienced reduced well investment due to reduced drilling days and lower service costs 
we believe well performance is likely to improve as knowledge increases with additional well development and introduction of new technologies

the alternate base rate is calculated as the greater of a the prime rate or b the federal funds effective rate plus  plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized greater than of the borrowing base 
we elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee under the credit agreement quarterly in arrears based on a percentage multiplied by the daily amount that the aggregate commitments exceed borrowings under the agreement 
the commitment fee percentage varies from to based on the percentage of the borrowing base utilized 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit facility  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the most recent quarter multiplied by four not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of the covenants contained in the credit agreement

at december   our oil and gas reserves were natural gas of which were developed 

table of contents the majority of the revisions of previous estimates were a result of the following fifty gross locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were omitted from the reserve report because these locations did not yield a positive net present value at a discount rate of at the current estimated capital investment based on recent historical data to drill and complete wells in this area 
four gross locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were developed in and two gross proved undeveloped locations were added 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  however  a combination of estimated cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our unused borrowing base of  are expected to fund our working capital during the next year 
the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the years ended december  net cash provided by operations net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash flow the increase in cash provided by operations from to is primarily from increased working capital due to amounts received in connection with our drilling program that were recorded as advances from joint interest owners  partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas revenue due to lower natural gas prices 
the average sales price per mcf of natural gas declined from in to in from to  the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to a increase in gross revenue during the increase was comprised of a increase in oil and gas production and a increase in interest income due to a higher outstanding average balance in cash and short term investments  partially offset by a decrease in gas prices during the production increases in and were primarily due to drilling activity 
our investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to our development and exploration activities the purchase of a drilling rig during in  we had sales proceeds of  which represented the sale of a partial interest in two of our producing wells in connection with our drilling program discussed previously 
during  we had sales proceeds of  which represented the sale of acreage to an unrelated entity 
we had no property sales during we sold   and  of our short term investments during  and  respectively 
the remaining investing activity during  and consisted primarily of changes in our restricted investments 

table of contents our financing activities during included the public offering of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  additionally during  we borrowed  under our existing line of credit  of which  was repaid during the year 
our financing activities during were comprised mainly of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options partially offset by cash paid for offering costs and preferred dividends 
the financing activity in was primarily comprised of the net proceeds from the sale of equity and convertible notes 
during  we closed a public offering of  shares of common stock for net proceeds  after underwriting discount and offering costs  of  additionally during   options to purchase gasco common stock were exercised for proceeds of  capital budget the board of directors of gasco approved a budget of approximately  for our capital expenditure program 
the program will cover primarily the drilling and completion of approximately gross wells net wells on our riverbend project 
the budget also includes expenditures for the installation of associated pipeline infrastructure  distribution facilities and geophysical operations 
this budget will be funded primarily from cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
management believes it has sufficient capital for its operational budget  but may need to raise additional capital for its capital budget in the company may consider several options for raising additional funds such as selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar type arrangements 
any financing obtained through the sale of gasco equity will likely result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders

see further discussion in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect the company s financial disclosures 
oil and gas reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties and the cost of any property not being amortized 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 

table of contents as of september   oil and gas prices were per barrel and per mcf 
our oil and gas reserves became uneconomic as the gas price on september  was less than our gathering costs to transport the gas to a sales point and would have resulted in an impairment of  however  subsequent to quarter end  oil and gas prices increased  and using these prices our full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  additionally  as of june   based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf  the full cost pool exceeded the above described ceiling by  subsequent to that quarter end  oil and gas prices increases reduced our impairment to  therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the year ended december   respectively 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on us because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the overall value of our company 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved properties 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of our wells have been producing less than seven years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the estimates of our proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as our wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
for example a decrease in price of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in our december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to 
table of contents reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
our management reviews all unproved property each quarter 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that we do not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  we record an impairment of the acreage and reclassify the costs to the full cost pool 
we estimate the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that we have recorded were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by gasco 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that we do not plan to develop in order to calculate the impairment 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total of the impairment recorded by gasco 
during the year ended december   approximately  of unproved leasehold costs related to our wyoming acreage were reclassified to proved property and included in the ceiling test and depletion calculations 
management believes that the continued low natural gas prices received in the rockies have caused the potential resources related to our wyoming acreage to become uneconomic 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of option awards under sfas no 
r 
this model requires us to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of our common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
derivatives during and  we entered into certain derivative instruments to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
we account for our derivatives and hedging activities under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 we are required to record our derivative instruments at their fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current 
table of contents earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  if any  are recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are recognized in earnings 
management has decided not to use cash flow hedge accounting for our derivatives 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
we recorded an unrealized loss on derivative instruments of  during results of operations compared to oil and gas revenue and production the following table sets forth the production volumes  average sales prices and revenue by product for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  natural gas production mcf average sales price per mcf natural gas revenue oil production bbl average sales price per bbl oil revenue production mcfe total oil and gas revenue the decrease in oil and gas revenue of  in compared to is comprised of a decrease in the average gas price of per mcf partially offset by an increase of per bbl in the average oil price during and a increase in oil and gas production primarily due to the drilling and completion activity during and the production increase during was partially offset by our decision to curtail production on some of our existing wells due to the low natural gas prices as discussed previously as well as normal production declines on wells drilled during earlier periods 
the  decrease in oil and gas revenue during represents a decrease of  related to the decrease in gas prices partially offset by the increase in oil prices and by an increase of  related to increased oil and gas production 
gathering revenue and expenses gathering revenue and expense represents the income earned from the third party working interest owners in the wells we operate our share of gathering revenue is eliminated against the 
table of contents transportation expense included in our lease operating costs and the expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline that we constructed during and the gathering income decreased by  in as compared to due to the decreased production on wells in which third parties had a working interest 
the decrease in gathering expense of  during is primarily due to a revision in the methodology for calculating charges related to compressor fuel during unrealized derivative loss unrealized derivative loss during is a noncash expense representing the recording of the fair value of a natural gas swap agreement during december the fair value was calculated by applying forward pricing information to the notional quantities in our derivative contracts and using normal discount rates 
the derivative loss is primarily due to the fact that the forward pricing is estimated to be higher than the fixed price of our natural gas swap 
rental income rental income during represents the revenue from the rental of our drilling rig to outside operated wells in which we do not have an ownership interest 
interest income interest income decreased  in compared with primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during resulting from our investment in oil and gas properties 
lease operating expenses the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas lease operating expenses during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  direct operating expenses and overhead workover expense total operating expenses operating expenses per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe total lease operating expense per mcfe lease operating expense increased  during compared with the increase is comprised of a  increase in operating expenses primarily due to the increase in

the depletion  depreciation and amortization expense decrease of  is primarily due to the  reduction in the full cost pool due to the impairments recorded during the second quarter and third quarters of  as described below  which results in a lower depletion base 
however  the decline in depletion  depreciation  and amortization resulting from the impairment is partially offset by the increase in oil and gas production and related capital costs resulting from our increased drilling and completion activity discussed above 
impairment impairment expense of  during represents the impairment recorded as of june  and september  because the present value of our future net revenue discounted at exceeded our full cost pool based on current oil and gas prices 
as of june  prices were per barrel and per mcf 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended june  as of september   oil and gas prices were per mcf and per barrel 
our oil and gas reserves became uneconomic as the gas price on september  was less than our gathering costs to transport the gas to a sales point and would have resulted in an impairment of  however  subsequent to quarter end  oil and gas prices increased  and using these prices our full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended september  general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods presented

the production increase is due to our drilling  completion and recompletion activity during and and is partially offset by normal production declines on all wells 
gathering revenue and expenses gathering revenue and expense from gathering operations represents the income earned and expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline that we constructed during and the gathering revenue increased by  during as compared with due to the increased production attributable to the outside working interest owners  resulting from our drilling activity in this area 
approximately  of the  increase in expense from gathering operations is due to the installation of additional compression to the system and approximately  of the increase is the result of our decision to revise our methodology for calculating charges related to compressor fuel 
the additional expense resulting from this change represents amounts that will be refunded to the outside working interest and royalty owners in our producing wells 
the remaining increase is related to increase operating costs related to the increased production in the area

these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
our derivative contracts are described below for our swap instruments  gasco receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
our costless collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  gasco receives the fixed price and pays the market price
