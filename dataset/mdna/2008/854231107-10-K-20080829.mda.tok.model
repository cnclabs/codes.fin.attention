item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse industrial market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group adp  engraving group  engineered products group and hydraulics products group 
through the execution of our focused diversity strategy  we have transformed ourselves from a company comprised of a mix of consumer and industrial businesses to one that is now exclusively a manufacturer of products sold to commercial and industrial customers 
our objective is to identify those of our businesses which hold the greatest potential for profitable growth  and direct our resources to supporting both organic growth and acquisition opportunities in those businesses 
over the past two years  we have taken important steps in the implementation of our strategy 
through two significant acquisitions which we made in our food service equipment group in fiscal  we increased the size of that group by approximately in terms of revenues and greatly diversified the group s product offerings to include  among other things  a broad based line of hot side products to complement not only our existing hot side product offerings  but also what was already a strong presence in our cold side product offerings 
we experienced both sales and cost synergies from the increased size and breadth of the food service equipment group in fiscal first  the ability to offer customers of certain of the group s products a broader array of product offerings allowed us to strengthen our relationships with key customers and add new customers to our existing base 
second  the increased size of the group and the greater purchasing leverage resulting from consolidating the purchase of various commodities and components across our food service businesses has allowed us to achieve cost reductions in excess of million in freight costs  and the cost of raw materials such as steel  a material common to most of the group s products 
the initiatives that we have undertaken in the group were principal factors in the improvement in the group s sales and earnings in fiscal despite a challenging economic environment in many of the markets served by the group 
a second initiative in our overall strategy was the continued expansion of our mold texturization business in international locations 
in addition to the continued growth of that business  which primarily serves the global automotive industry  in china  we opened facilities this year in turkey and the czech republic  two nations with rapidly expanding presences in vehicle manufacturing 
third  we have continued our effort to consolidate manufacturing operations to improve the leverage of our manufacturing infrastructure and to reduce fixed overhead expenses 
during fiscal  we closed one engineered products group facility and two engraving group facilities  and consolidated the operations conducted at those locations into other facilities 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  we have closed an additional facility in the adp group 
in addition to the implementation of our business strategy  we continue to focus on operational excellence in all of our business units  by taking steps to reduce our operating costs and improve the management of our working capital 
as noted above  the increased size and breadth of our food service equipment group has allowed us to reduce our freight and raw material costs 
in addition  we are sourcing an increasing percentage of our raw materials and components from lower cost producers  primarily offshore  relocating manufacturing operations to lower cost countries such as mexico and china  substituting materials and standardizing common product components where appropriate  implementing lean manufacturing processes throughout our operations  and analyzing whether it is more economical to acquire certain components from outside suppliers  rather than produce them internally 
although the continued implementation of our strategy facilitated improvements in sales and earnings in fiscal  we do have businesses which were affected this past year by difficult economic conditions in their markets 
sales in our adp group declined by almost from the previous year  and income from operations was negative 
the business serves the new residential housing market  which continued to decline during the year 
sales and earnings in the hydraulics products group also declined  due to a variety of factors including high fuel prices  reduced releases of governmental highway spending funds  and an excess of new  used and repossessed equipment in the marketplace 
there are a number of key external factors other than general business and economic conditions that can impact the performance of our businesses 
the key factors affecting each business are described below in the segment analysis 
there are several items that affect the comparability of our performance information between the periods discussed in this report 
these items included the sale and leaseback of our adp building in philadelphia in  the curtailment of our us salaried defined benefit plan in  the acquisition of the two food service businesses in and the completion of our manufacturing facility in mexico in we monitor a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin other operating income restructuring expense income from operations backlog net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales decline growth net sales increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
the net sales increase was positively impacted by acquisitions and favorable exchange rates 
organic sales grew million or 
sales in our adp and hydraulics products segments experienced declines  as downturns in the housing and heavy truck industries impacted the respective sales of these segments 
discussions of the performance of all our segments is more fully detailed below in the segment analysis 
the increase in net sales of million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year  is entirely attributable to acquisitions made during the year 
sales in our adp  hydraulics products and engraving groups all experienced declines  as downturns in the housing  heavy truck and automotive industries impacted the sales of these groups 
in addition to these sales declines  our master bilt refrigeration walk in and cabinet business experienced a sales decline in fiscal this decline was offset by improvements in several of the other businesses of our food service equipment group 
discussions of these performances are more fully detailed below in the segment analysis 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin increased in fiscal to from in during fiscal  the company s food service equipment group experienced an increase in gross margins due to cost reductions and improved productivity  particularly at the company s master bilt division where operational inefficiencies had negatively impacted margins in our gross profit margin  declined in fiscal to from in during fiscal  we experienced a sales volume decline which caused negative impacts to our gross margins 
in addition many of our businesses experienced material cost increases which we were unable to pass onto our customers 
of the businesses impacted  our adp and master bilt businesses experienced the greatest declines year over year 
other operating income expense and restructuring the company includes restructuring charges and certain other operating expenses and income as separate line items 
other operating income expense includes gains or losses on the sale of real property 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of three manufacturing locations within our engineered products and engraving groups 
we incurred restructuring costs of  in connection with these closures 
during fiscal  we completed the closure of one manufacturing location and the consolidation of those operations into an existing facility within our engineered products group 
we incurred restructuring costs of  in connection with this closure 
we also completed the sale of excess land located at our corporate office facility  resulting in a gain of million in fiscal income from operations income from operations during increased million  or when compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  the increase was million or 
this increase is due to several factors including cost reductions and improvements in productivity at a number of the company s divisions  profit leverage resulting from a organic sales growth  and reduced us pension plan expense due to the freezing of the salaried defined benefit plan 
discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
our income from operations decreased over million in fiscal  or when compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  the decline was over million 
this decline is due to several factors 
our adp group s income from operations declined by million  or over  when compared to fiscal our food service equipment group  excluding the impact of acquisitions  declined by million  or  when compared to fiscal our engraving and hydraulics products groups also declined year over year 
these declines were partially offset by reduced corporate expenses 
income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to the prior year s effective rate of and a rate of in the higher tax rate in the current year relates in part to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at december  the lower tax rate in fiscal year includes a benefit from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes and a benefit from the impact resulting from retroactive extension of the r d credit 
capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in fiscal  our capital expenditures of million were below our annual depreciation due to our decision to pay down a portion of the debt incurred as the result of our acquisitions 
in fiscal  we reduced our capital expenditures to million due in large part to the re direction of our capital to the two acquisitions 
backlog backlog at june  decreased million when compared to fiscal  a decrease when compared to prior year 
this decrease is largely due to decreases in our refrigerated cabinet and walk in cooler business offset by increases to customers of our spincraft division 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group engineered products hydraulics products group food service equipment fiscal net sales in the food service equipment group fseg increased million when compared to fiscal  a increase to million 
acquisitions accounted for million of the sales increase 
the acquisition growth was due to the full year impact of the associated american industries aai and american food service acquisitions completed in favorable exchange rate gains accounted for approximately million of the segment s sales increase 
organic sales growth of million accounted for the remainder of the growth 
all fseg major brands experienced positive organic growth through a combination of market share gains  price increases  moderate growth of core markets  broadening our customer base and expanding into new markets 
we are  however  seeing softness in our cabinet business sales to the ice cream market which is expected to continue in fiscal our master bilt and nor lake divisions experienced organic growth in excess of driven by sales of walk in refrigeration products to new and existing customers 
additionally  during the year  we were successful in growing sales to nationwide restaurant chains  increasing sales to dealers  capturing several large refrigerated warehouse projects  and broadening our markets in scientific and blood plasma industries 
with the completion of two acquisitions during fiscal  fseg sales increased more than million when compared to fiscal  a increase 
the increase in sales is almost completely attributable to acquisitions  which added million 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  sales within the fseg were largely unchanged from the prior year  increasing  or less than when compared to fiscal during the fiscal year  several of our existing businesses experienced double digit increases in sales in their core markets served 
the organic growth rate of our pump and display case businesses were over during the fiscal year while our nor lake refrigeration walk in and cabinet business experienced a increase 
the combination of these increases added an additional million to sales in fiscal a combination of the strength of the core markets and price increases obtained were the primary drivers behind th e sales performances 
the relocation of the pump business s manufacturing activities to mexico in fiscal resulted in a decline in sales in that year 
the pump sales rebounded in fiscal these positive sales performances were offset by a decline of  or million  in our master bilt refrigeration walk in and cabinet sales 
in the first half of our fiscal year  a combination of quality and delivery issues resulted in a deterioration in sales volume during that period 
during the second half of the fiscal year  sales increased as both the quality and delivery issues were resolved 
air distribution products adp s fiscal sales declined million from fiscal levels  a reduction 
the decrease in adp s volume is due to the continuing  significant decline in new residential construction offset partially by market share gains 
standex evaluates the available market for adp by monitoring the new housing start data  published monthly by the us department of housing and urban development 
sales to the segment s customers typically lag new home starts by three to four months 
during fiscal the housing starts deteriorated by over while during the same period adp s sales  adjusted for price changes  were lower by 
adp is pursuing market share gains through its traditional wholesaler channels by expanding its sales force  focusing on accounts where we are under penetrated and by emphasizing our ability to service nation wide wholesalers through our network of factory locations 
these initiatives hav e resulted in market share gains  however  the additional sales volume resulting from these efforts has not been sufficient to offset the decline in the overall market 
sales in fiscal decreased by over million  a decrease compared to fiscal as new housing starts in decreased over from their peak levels reached in prior years 
engraving group sales in the engraving group increased by million  or  from the fiscal level 
sales growth was driven primarily in mold texturization 
these results were partially offset by weakness in the roll  plate and machinery business which was negatively impacted by slowdowns in the automotive and housing markets 
net sales increased by million when compared to fiscal after excluding the effects of foreign exchange which added million 
the largest industry served by the mold texturization business is the automotive industry 
sales in this industry are driven by the number of new and redesigned platforms that the oem s introduce during the year 
during fiscal  sales to the automotive industry experienced an increase due to market share gains  strong demand from our automotive oem customers in north american and europe  growth in our china operations as well as very solid performance in our european businesse s 
we believe that our global presence  as well as our ability to be very responsive to our automotive oem customers needs will continue to allow us to leverage our customers desire to work with one company worldwide while meeting their requirements for design and production consistency 
net sales decreased million in fiscal  a decrease over fiscal acquisitions accounted for an increase in sales of approximately million while favorable exchange rates added an additional million 
the remaining decrease of million was attributable to weak demand within the group s mold texturization business  especially from its automotive customers 
our two businesses in china also experienced flat sales during that period 
engineered products sales in this group increased million  or  in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
this group is comprised of three businesses  two metal spinning and fabrication businesses and one electronics business 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses  which serve customers in the energy  aviation and aerospace industries  experienced significant growth year over year  accounting for the majority of the sales increase of this group 
recent trends within the energy  aerospace  and aviation industries indicate that oem manufacturers are increasingly sourcing fabricated metal parts from third parties rather than manufacturing these parts themselves which has benefited our spinning and fabrication businesses 
during the year  one of our metal spinning businesses secured an million contract for tooling and hardware related to nasa s orion rocket program 
we have recognized million of revenue related to this contract in in addition  the group experienced a million increase in sales due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
heading into fiscal  the energy and aerospace markets show no signs of slowdown 
flat year over year sales at our electronics business are attributable to weakness in the automotive  security  hvac and white goods markets offset by new business in the aerospace  medical and controls markets 
sales in this group increased million  or  in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses  which serve customers in the energy  aviation and aerospace industries  experienced revenue growth of million year over year  accounting for the majority of the increase in this group 
our electronics business also experienced growth of million during the year due to the combination of price increases and volume increases 
hydraulics products group sales declined by million  or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the declines were in the us market  where several events occurred over the last year resulting in a decline in cylinder sales for the group 
the most significant event was the engine design changes required to meet new epa emission requirements 
although intended to reduce emissions on long haul trucks  these changes also reduced fuel efficiency while driving up the cost of the newer engines 
the result of these events was a significant decline in oem truck sales  coupled with the general slowdown in the us economy  lack of highway funds being released  excess inventory of new  used and repossessed equipment  and the dramatic rise in the price of fuels 
these factors have resulted in a decline in new orders for dump trucks and trailers thus negatively affecting sales to the group 
several positive steps have been undertaken to re position the group by focusing on the international marketplace 
in fiscal  export sales to europe  the middle east  mexico and korea grew by approximately over the prior year 
new sales and service operations have also been established in portugal and germany whereby distribution and sales channels have allowed us to expand in these geographic territories 
sales declined by million  or  in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the period prior to the implementation of the epa emissions regulations prompted a large number of orders for dump truck and trailers before the effective date of january  this advanced buying positively impacted our fiscal performance  making the year over year comparison to more difficult 
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group engineered products hydraulics products restructuring other expenses  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment profit performance increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase 
the full year impact of acquisitions completed in fiscal added approximately million in income from operations during fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  income from operations increased million  or  compared to fiscal our master bilt and nor lake divisions experienced operating income growth in excess of driven by organic sales growth  price increases  cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies in all manufacturing locations 
our procon pump business experienced a improvement in operating income due to organic sales growth  exchange gains  material cost reduction programs and operational improvements in their mexico and ireland operations 
many of the materials used in fseg products such as metals  foam ins ulation and copper  have experienced price inflation throughout the fiscal year 
we continue to look for opportunities to offset these increases by implementing price increases to our customers and leveraging our consolidated purchases in negotiations with key vendors such as steel  compressors and freight carriers  and by pursuing better utilization of materials through value analysis and scrap reduction initiatives 
we also continue to look for opportunities to source components from china and other low cost countries 
income from operations decreased  in fiscal  a decline from fiscal acquisitions added million in income from operations during fiscal  consistent with our expectations 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  income from operations declined by million  or  compared to fiscal the decline is attributable to several factors 
first  the positive sales performances discussed above added an additional million in income from operations 
our pump business s income from operations increased more than while our nor lake refrigeration walk in and cabinet business s income from operations increased more than when compared to fiscal these positive performances were offset by a decline in our master bilt business  whose year over year income from operations declined over million 
this business was negatively impacted by decreased sales volumes  an inability to pas s on material cost increases to customers and increased warranty costs associated with quality issues early in our fiscal year 
air distribution products fiscal income from operations decreased million from prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to sales volume declines and to a lesser extent  material cost increases 
metal costs escalated more than during the period 
specific raw material cost reduction strategies along with third and fourth quarter price increases helped to partially offset these cost escalations 
both price increases have received market wide acceptance 
going forward these price increases should improve operating income performance for this group 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or 
this decrease was due to both sales volume declines and material cost increases 
these results are a combination of the housing market in fiscal contracting reducing sales  coupled with an inability to pass through sufficient price increases to offset increasing costs 
engraving group income from operations increased by million  or  when compared to fiscal sales volume increases and productivity improvements in the world wide mold texturizing facilities led to significant profit growth in this portion of the engraving group 
in the mold texturizing business we opened a new facility in turkey and a larger facility in the czech republic which contributed to positive earnings growth during the year 
operating income was down year over year in the roll and plate engraving and embossing equipment businesses due primarily to the impact of lower volume resulting from the downturn in the us housing and automotive market  where a large percentage of this unit s products are applied 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year we announced the closure of two roll engraving facilities in north america which will be consolidated into an existing operation by early fiscal in order to better utilize a ssets and reduce overhead costs 
we continue to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques throughout the group in order to improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  a decrease from the prior year 
the positive performance of the business acquired in innovent was more than offset by decreases in our mold texturization business 
the sales delays in that business and the high level of fixed costs associated with these businesses caused income from operations to be depressed during the year 
engineered products income from operations increased million  or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the improvement in income from operations was attributed to the growth in aerospace and energy sales coupled with cost reductions achieved through lean manufacturing techniques and the use of low cost manufacturing in mexico and china by the electronics business unit 
the improvement in operating income resulting from these efforts was partially offset by labor inefficiencies associated with the closure of a canadian electronics manufacturing facility and production inefficiencies due to the commissioning of new capital equipment and new product launches at two spincraft locations 
these issues were resolved by the end of fiscal income from operations increased million in fiscal  a increase when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the improvement is largely due to our electronics business 
in fiscal  we initiated manufacturing activities in china for this business 
by the end of fiscal  we achieved our goal of producing in china nearly of all of our product sold 
this contributed to the improvement in income from operations performance for this business 
in addition  we consolidated our us based operations into two locations  from three previously 
the reduction in fixed costs resulting from this consolidation contributed to the improved operating performance of this unit s business 
our metal spinning businesses also contributed to income from operations of the group 
however  the improvement in income from operations lagged the sales performance primarily due to a shift between products sold into the energy and aviation industry verses the aerospace business 
margins within the energy and aviation products generally are lower than those for aerospace products 
hydraulics products income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier due primarily to the year over year sales decline of 
products produced by this segment experienced reduced demand due to a challenging off road construction vehicle market 
we have successfully tested and imported several material components sourced directly from china  resulting in the incorporation of lower cost components into the designs and production of cylinders in the us the outcome of this action in the us has yielded positive results and will also enhance the initiation of manufacturing operations in china 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier 
in connection with our expansion into china  additional costs were incurred including increased selling and marketing costs  increased distribution costs and other operating cost increases 
we believe that these costs represented a necessary investment in the introduction of products into new markets that are important to the continued growth of the hydraulics products group 
corporate corporate expense increased million  or  during this increase is primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as compared to the company has in place a shareholder approved performance based long term stock compensation program for a group of approximately senior executives 
the expenses associated with this program are recorded within the corporate segment 
grants with specific financial performance targets are made to management annually as part of the long term incentive program 
we account for these awards by using the fair value of the awards on the grant date and an estimate of the probability of the achievement of the performance criteria 
during the accruals made for grants issued between and were reversed when we determined that the achievement of the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable 
the net effect of reversing these accruals was a m illion reduction to stock based compensation expense in fiscal in fiscal we recorded approximately million of expense for the long term stock compensation program for grants made in fiscal we also incurred additional professional services expenses throughout the year related to filling open positions and outside legal fees to settle certain claims 
operating expenses for corporate decreased million in fiscal  a decrease when compared to the same period one year earlier 
this decrease is largely the result of reductions in stock based compensation  professional fees and pension expenses 
with the decline in performance of the company during fiscal  we determined that the achievement of the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable  resulting in the reversal of any recognized compensation expense 
the net effect of this reversal to the current year expenses was a million reduction in stock based compensation at corporate 
discontinued operations during  the company entered into an administrative order of consent with the us environmental protection agency related to the removal of various pcb contaminated materials and soils at a site where the company leased a building and conducted operations from the company has recorded an environmental loss contingency totaling million related to its participation at the site 
also during fiscal  the company sold certain land  buildings and improvements related to the standard publishing business for net proceeds of million in cash 
the company recorded a gain on disposal of  in connection with the sale 
the company also received  in cash from the release of the funds placed in escrow in connection with the sale of useco s product line in the second quarter of fiscal the company recorded a gain on disposal of  upon receipt of the funds released from escrow 
in march  the company entered into a plan to dispose of certain assets of its useco product lines 
useco  which was part of the food service equipment group  manufactures and sells rethermalization systems for meal deliveries to institutions  including governmental institutions  and under sink food disposals 
the company determined that the product lines of useco do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the food service equipment group 
the company also determined that the markets that this business serves are not growing 
during fiscal  the company recognized a loss of million  consisting of the write down of the carrying cost of inventory in connection with the plan to sell the businesses 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company was able to complete the sale of the under sink food disposals product line resulting in a gain on the sale of a portion of useco business of approximately  off set by losses from the useco operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the remaining useco rethermalization systems business could not be sold  and accordingly  shutdown the operations  accelerating the depreciation expense on the remaining manufacturing equipment and ceasing the manufacturing operations 
any inventory remaining was analyzed and  where usable and transferable to our other businesses  was transferred to current operations 
the remaining inventory was previously fully reserved for 
in connection with the shutdown  the company retained the warranty risk for previously sold units 
the company has analyzed those needs and believes that the current recorded balance of  is sufficient to cover future costs to support warranty claims 
during the quarter ended march   the company announced plans to sell the businesses in its consumer products group  including standex direct  standard publishing and berean christian stores 
the businesses within the consumer products group were determined not to fit strategically with the company s other operating segments as these businesses have few synergies to leverage across the other segments 
the company also determined that its capital resources could be better allocated among those businesses in its other operating segments that offered opportunities for growth 
in march  the company completed the sale of certain assets of standex direct and recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with the sale 
in july  the company sold substantially all the assets of the standard publishing business in an all cash deal and recognized a pre tax gain of million in this transaction 
in august  the company sold substantially all the assets of the berean christian stores business in an all cash deal resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of  in connection with berean  the company was party under a number of operating leases for existing stores and one closed store 
the store leases in this transaction were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the lease at the stated lease costs 
the company and the buyer have agreed that the buyer will have no rights under the leases to exercise any options to extend 
the company is therefore the guarantor under the operating leases until the expiration of the initial term 
the company s aggregate obligation under these leases would equal approximately million 
at june   the company has a liability of  representing the difference between the expected sub lease rental income and the rental costs for a store closed in connection with the sale 
during fiscal  the company recorded  in costs associated with a business it disposed of in fiscal at the time of the sale of the business  certain employees of the business were terminated 
several of these employees subsequently made claims under the company s workers compensation program 
the company has vigorously fought these claims but determined that the claims have developed in excess of previously recorded estimates 
the company has recorded its best estimate of the additional costs of these claims 
in fiscal  the company also recorded an additional  in costs for a product liability claim associated with a business sold in our fiscal the company reached a settlement in this matter and does not expect to incur any additional costs in future periods 
both changes in estimates have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for the year end ed june  liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from continuing operating activities and our revolving credit facility with seven banks 
continuing operations generated million in cash flow for the year ended june   compared to million in fiscal the increase is largely attributable to a combination of improved operating activities and the continued focus on improving working capital management 
we define net working capital as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable 
in  total net working capital decreased million from the prior year level as compared to a million increase between and a  decrease from excluding acquisitions and dispositions 
we spent million on capital expenditures during and paid dividends to our shareholders of million 
the sale and leaseback of the adp facility in philadelphia generated net cash proceeds of million 
excess cash generated during was used to reduce outstanding borrowings by million 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  operating lease payments  pension contributions  mandatory debt payments and dividends 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of cash flows from continuing operations and any available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
capital structure we have in place a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with seven participating banks which was originated in september funds available under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
the agreement contains certain covenants including funded debt to ebitda and ebit to interest expense 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal libor plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of june   the effective rate of interest for outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
we are required to pay an annual fee of 
on the maximum credit line 
as of june  and  we had borrowings of million and million  respectively under the revolving facilities 
available borrowings under the facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
at june   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the facility 
we also utilize money market credit facilities with two banks to help manage daily working capital needs 
the agreements  which are renewed annually  provide for a maximum aggregate credit line of million and are unsecured 
as of june  and  we had and  respectively  outstanding under these agreements 
at june  and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding for insurance purposes of million and million  respectively 
the company s long term debt also includes amounts associated with note purchase agreements with institutional investors 
as of june   we had two note purchase agreements with institutional investors of million each  dated october and october the notes bear interest at annual rates of and  respectively 
each note purchase agreement requires payment of interest semi annually 
the note purchase agreement dated october requires an annual payment of million that commenced in october the note purchase agreement dated october is due and payable in october as of june  and  the balance outstanding under the note purchase agreements aggregated million and million  respectively 
upon maturity of the note due october  we intend to either enter into a new note purchase agreement or to repay it through borrowings under our revolving credit facilit y 
our decision will be based on our view of both short and long term interest rates along with conditions in the credit market at maturity date 
in july  we entered into a series of swap agreements with one and two year terms effectively converting interest payments on our long term debt from variable to fixed rates 
we converted interest payments on million of debt due under our revolving credit agreement from variable rates based on libor to a weighted average fixed rate of for an effective rate of based on our current leverage ratio 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of the net income of million  favorable foreign currency movements of million and changes in the pension values of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises and stock based compensation in the current year 
the company s net debt to capital percentage decreased from to in fiscal due to a reduction in working capital  increased cash from operating activities and the sale of adp s philadelphia location  all of which were used to repay borrowings 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
additionally  sfas requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
as a result  we have included a million after tax charge in stockholders equity in fiscal to reflect the change in measurement date and a million after tax charge in stockholders equity i n fiscal to reflect the previously unrecognized actuarial losses under these plans 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an amount known as the additional minimum liability to equity 
the additional minimum liability was calculated based on the funded status of the plans at the end of the measurement period 
the after tax equity charge and the change year to year does not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
during fiscal  the retirement plans committee of the board of directors voted to freeze the pension benefits accruing under the salaried defined benefit plan and the supplemental defined benefit plan 
effective on january  all participants will no longer accrue any future benefits under the plans 
this action reduced pension expenses by approximately million in and we expect that it will reduce pension expense by million in there were no cash contribution requirements in for any of our us defined benefit plans 
the cost of this plan enhancement will offset a portion of the savings expected from the decision to freeze the defined benefit plan 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was million and million at june  and  respectively 
during  the company made a decision to withdraw cash that had accumulated above the value of certain of these policies 
this withdrawal resulted in a cash settlement of million during the fourth quarter of contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest payments post retirement benefit payments purchase obligations total estimated interest payments are based upon effective interest rates as of june  see item a for further discussions surrounding interest rate exposure on our variable rate borrowings 
post retirement benefit payments are based upon current benefit payment levels plus estimated health care costs trends of in the first year trending to through fiscal off balance sheet items in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
we are a guarantor under the initial remaining terms of each assigned lease  totaling million 
we do not expect to make any payments as a result of these guarantees 
we had no other material off balance sheet items at june  and at june   other than the operating leases and purchase obligations summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the yuan and euro have experienced increases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  the yuan has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  while the pound has decreased relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters during  the company entered into an administrative order of consent with the us environmental protection agency related to the removal of various pcb contaminated materials and soils at a site where the company leased a building and conducted operations from see the notes to our consolidated financials statements for further information regarding this event 
the company has established an accrual in the amount of million relating to discontinued operations 
we are party to various other claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to our business 
we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality we are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality  however our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of activity 
employee relations we maintain a solid working relationship with all of our unions and good employee relations are a focus of our management 
the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
we renegotiated four union contracts during there was one work stoppage associated with these renegotiations during fiscal year we had no work stoppages during a total of four collective bargaining contracts covering approximately employees will expire in fiscal there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill is not amortized  however  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  annually in the fourth quarter we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method and comparing that amount to the carrying value 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
the nature of the estimates made in projecting future cash flows could adversely affect the calculations made by us 
we have performed our annual testing of goodwill for impairment and have concluded that the goodwill recorded in the adp segment is not impaired 
as part of our impairment review we analyzed housing starts over the past years 
this review pointed out that during this time frame housing starts have gone through a number of cycles 
for example  during the prior years housing starts have peaked between and million annualized housing starts times and have bottomed at a rate of to million annualized housing starts five times 
our impairment analysis took into consideration that the residential housing market is cyclical and that adp s financial performance will improve as the us residential housing market recovers 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  per year 
a thirty basis point decrease increase in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements on june   we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  fas 
fas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
additionally  fas requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
as a result  we included a million after tax charge in stockholders equity in fiscal to reflect the previously unrecognized actuarial losses under these plans 
prior to the adoption of fas  we recorded an amount known as the additional minimum liability to equity 
the additional minimum liability was calculated based on the funded status of the plans at the end of the measurement period 
effective july   we changed the measurement date for our plans to june accordingly  pension expense in fiscal has been measured based on assumptions as of june  we adopted the transition guidance of this standard in fiscal by adjusting beginning retained earnings for the period between the old measurement date and the new measurement date 
on july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not recognize any change in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  we mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and june   we have no open foreign currency forward contracts 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro  british pound sterling and chinese yuan 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any of the foreign currencies to the us dollar at june  would not result in a material increase in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling and chinese yuan 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  at june  and  we have no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in july of the company entered into a series of swaps in order to lock in favorable interest rates for periods of one and two years 
the company also has million of long term debt and million of short term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with this long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
concentration of credit risk the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
in certain segments  some customers represent greater than of the segments revenues 
in the food service equipment group  customers account for approximately of annual sales 
in our engineered products segment  one aerospace customer accounts for approximately of segment annual revenues and one energy customer accounts for approximately of annual sales 
in many of our businesses our national accounts regularly review their selection of vendors 
although our companies have historically prevailed and even gained market share under these circumstances  the outcome of future reviews can not be predicted 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortages 
prices for steel products have fluctuated over the last several fiscal years 
the adp  engineered products  food service equipment and hydraulics products groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
during fiscal  we experienced price increases for a number of materials including copper wire  other metal commodities  rhodium  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
our affected divisions have generally implemented price increases intended on fully offsetting the increases in steel 
the implemented price increases in the food service equipment  adp and engineered products group did not fully offset the higher material costs 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of material prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  i f implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
