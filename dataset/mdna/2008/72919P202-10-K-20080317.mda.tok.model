table of contents overview plug power inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a development stage enterprise involved in the design  development and manufacture of fuel cell systems for stationary and industrial motive forklift markets worldwide 
we are focused on the application of proton exchange membrane  or pem  fuel cell and fuel processing technologies from which we are developing multiple products 
the company is a development stage enterprise because substantially all of the company s resources and efforts are aimed at the discovery of new knowledge that could lead to significant improvement in fuel cell reliability and durability and the establishment of a market for the company s products 
the company continues to experience significant net outflows of cash from operations and devotes significant efforts towards financial planning in order to forecast future cash spending and the ability to continue product research and development activities 
fuel cell technology within the company s targeted markets  telecommunications  broadband  utility  and industrial un interruptible power supply  as well as the mobile industrial equipment market recently entered into as a result of recent acquisitions  is still early in the technology adoption life cycle 
we are currently offering our kw hydrogen fueled gencore back up power product for commercial sale to telecommunications  un interruptible power ups and utility back up applications  with a focus on wireless telecommunications 
we are collaborating with ballard power systems  under government contract  to evaluate alternative stack technology for future products 
in we acquired cellex power products  inc and general hydrogen corporation  both leaders in the design and integration of pem fuel cell systems for forklift and industrial motive power products 
we are currently conducting prototype field tests with these hydrogen fueled gendrive systems that are intended to be a direct replacement for traditional lead acid battery packs on indoor industrial forklift applications 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention of collaborating with wal mart to test and demonstrate a broader deployment of our gendrive products in a commercial distribution center in additionally  we continue to develop our gensys continuous power products 
in we commissioned seventeen kw lpg fueled low temperature off grid pem systems in three separate deployments  including a system trial in india with a large wireless carrier 
as an extension of our gensys development work  we continue to develop technology in support of the automotive fuel cell market under a series of agreements with honda r d co ltd 
of japan honda  a subsidiary of honda motor co  ltd 
in we completed phase of our work with honda  installing and commissioning the phase system at honda s facility in torrance  california and began negotiations on a phase agreement 
we also form relationships with customers and enter into development and demonstration programs with government agencies and other energy providers 
many of our initial sales of gencore  gendrive and gensys are contract specific arrangements containing multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited commercial experience and lack of evidence of fair value 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue and recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the contractual terms as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire  which are generally for periods of twelve to thirty months 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
our distributors have no special right of return  price protection allowances or other sales incentives 
we do offer a discount from our manufacturers suggested retail price to resellers to allow for the mark up of the reseller 
as we gain commercial experience  including field experience relative to service and warranty of our initial products  the fair values for the multiple elements within our future contracts may become determinable and we may  in future periods  recognize product revenue upon delivery or installation of the product  or we may continue to defer recognition  based on application of appropriate guidance within eitf  accounting for 
table of contents revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or changes in the manner in which we structure contractual agreements  including our agreements with distribution partners 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our product development activities  ability to commercialize our fuel cell systems  market acceptance of our systems and other factors 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of million and working capital of million 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
during the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was million  consisting primarily of a net loss of million offset  in part  by non cash expenses in the amount of million  including million for amortization and depreciation and million for stock based compensation 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting of million of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset by million used to purchase property  plant and equipment and million net cash used for acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  we have financed our operations through december  primarily from the sale of equity  which has provided cash in the amount of million since inception 
also since inception  cumulative net cash used in operating activities has been million  and cash used in investing activities has been million  including our purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  our net investments in available for sale securities in the amount of million  and cash used for acquisitions of million  net of cash received 
results of operations product and service revenue 
we defer recognition of product and service revenue at the time of delivery and recognize revenue as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire 
many of our initial sales of product contain multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
while contract terms generally require payment shortly after delivery and installation of the fuel cell system and are not contingent on the achievement of specific milestones or other substantive performance  the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited experience and lack of evidence of fair value of the different components 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue and recognize revenue on a straight line basis as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire  which are currently for periods of twelve to thirty months 
in the case of our limited consignment sales  we do not begin recognizing revenue on a deferred basis until the customer has accepted the product  at which time the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the price is fixed and we have a reasonable expectation of collecting upon billing 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
product and service revenue for the year ended december  increased  or to million from million for the year ended december  approximately  of the increase is related to the acquisitions of cellex and general hydrogen 
the remaining amount of the increase is related to increased system shipments in and the revenue recognized on those shipments  partially offset by decreased revenue recognition for systems shipped prior to additionally  we recognized  and  of non deferred revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
this revenue represents revenue associated with replacement parts or services not covered by service agreements or other similar types of sales where the company has no continuing obligation after the parts are shipped or services rendered

research and development contract revenue primarily relates to cost reimbursement research and development contracts associated with the development of pem fuel cell technology 
we generally share in the cost of these programs with our cost sharing percentages being from to of total project costs 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized on the basis of hours expended plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on the basis of percentage of completion 
we expect to continue certain research and development contract work that is directly related to our current product development efforts 
research and development contract revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the acquisitions of cellex and general hydrogen accounted for approximately million of the increase 
of the remaining million increase  approximately million resulted from additional us department of energy doe contracts awarded in  million resulted from additional contracts received from the us department of defense dod in  and revenue from new contracts with nasa  the european union  and montana state university contributed approximately million in these increases were partially offset by decreases resulting from completion of activities under other government contracts in research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of spending levels decreasing for material purchases and subcontractor activity as certain doe and dod programs wound down and decreased activity under our contract with the national institute of standards and technology nist  and with honda r d co  ltd 
of japan 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product and service revenue includes the direct material cost incurred in the manufacture of the products we sell as well as the labor and material costs incurred for product maintenance  replacement parts and service under our contractual obligations 
these costs consist primarily of production materials and fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services 
cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million in approximately  of the increase is related to the acquisitions of cellex and general hydrogen 
the remaining increase of million primarily related to a million charge for certain future expected service and warranty costs for existing fuel cell units in the field 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in shipments and servicing costs of the larger installed base 
cost of product and service revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the year over year increase to cost of product and service revenue was primarily the result of an increase in warranty costs resulting from a greater number of units placed in the field during 
table of contents cost of research and development contract revenue 
cost of research and development contract revenue includes costs associated with research and development contracts including cash and non cash compensation and benefits for engineering and related support staff  fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services  fees paid to consultants for services provided  materials and supplies used and other directly allocable general overhead costs allocated to specific research and development contracts 
cost of research and development contract revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the acquisitions of cellex and general hydrogen contributed approximately million of this increase 
the remainder of the increase  about million  was associated with the additional effort applied to funded research and development projects commensurate with the additional revenue mentioned above 
cost of research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in these costs was directly related to the decreased activity under the development agreements described above under research and development contract revenue 
research and development expense 
research and development expense includes materials to build development and prototype units  cash and non cash compensation and benefits for the engineering and related staff  expenses for contract engineers  fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services  fees paid to consultants for services provided  materials and supplies consumed  facility related costs such as computer and network services  and other general overhead costs associated with our research and development activities 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the acquisitions of cellex and general hydrogen contributed million of additional research and development expense which was more than offset by a reduction of nearly million related to the activities of the pre acquisition business 
this reduction in expense is primarily related to the company s ability to receive increased third party funding to perform certain activities necessary to advance our understanding of various types of fuel cell systems consistent with our long term goal of developing systems and applications 
as a result of the receipt of funding for certain research and development programs  the related costs associated with these projects is included in cost of contract research and development revenue as described above 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of our accelerated efforts to advance the development of our next generation continuous run product combined with continued research and development activities related to future product initiatives 
we also had fewer resources allocated to research and development programs reflected in cost of revenues for research and development under doe  nist and honda research and development contracts as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses includes cash and non cash compensation  benefits and related costs in support of our general corporate functions  including general management  finance and accounting  human resources  selling and marketing  information technology and legal services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is related to the acquisition of cellex and general hydrogen 
the remaining million of the increase is primarily related to the increased size of our sales group in an effort to increase market adoption of our fuel cell technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and 
table of contents administrative expenses in from was primarily a result of increased headcount  charges related to severance packages for departing employees and payments made to strategic consultants 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as well as the net realized gain loss from the sale of available for sale securities 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  nearly all of the increase of million was the result of higher yields on our cash and available for sale securities in total net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities was a gain of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher cash and available for sale securities balances resulting from the sale of our class b capital stock to smart hydrogen inc in and slightly higher yields on our investment portfolio 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses consists of interest on repayable government assistance amounts related to the activities of cellex and general hydrogen  interest due to a long term obligation related to the purchase of our latham facilities  interest paid on capital lease obligations and foreign currency exchange loss 
interest and other expenses increased approximately  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to foreign currency exchange losses from our newly acquired canadian operations 
interest and other expenses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  as of december  the debt associated with the purchase of the facility was paid for in full 
equity in losses of affiliates 
equity in losses of affiliates for the year ended december  was million 
equity in losses of affiliates  which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting  was our proportionate share of the amount of the net loss of ge fuel cell systems gefcs  and the amortization of our original investments 
during the quarter ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss equal to of the remaining carrying value of the company s investment in gefcs due to the changes in the relationship that eventually resulted in gefcs being dissolved in the first quarter of fiscal income taxes 
we did not report a benefit for federal and state income taxes in the consolidated financial statements as the deferred tax asset generated from our net operating loss has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forward will not be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and related disclosures requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents specifically  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
therefore  our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause management to revise estimates  our financial position as reflected in our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
any effects on business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies affected by the estimates and assumptions the company must make in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures revenue recognition we are a development stage enterprise currently performing field testing and marketing of our products to a limited number of customers  including telecom  utilities  government entities  distribution centers  and our distribution partners 
this product is a limited edition fuel cell system that is intended to offer complementary  quality power while demonstrating the market value of fuel cells as a preferred form of alternative distributed power generation 
subsequent enhancements to our initial product are expected to expand the market opportunity for fuel cells by lowering the installed cost  decreasing operating and maintenance costs  increasing efficiency  improving reliability  and adding features such as grid independence and co generation as well as ups applications 
we apply the guidance within staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  to our initial sales contracts to determine when to properly recognize revenue 
our initial sales of products contain multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
while contract terms generally stipulate that title and risk of ownership pass and require payment shortly after delivery of the fuel cell system  or acceptance in the case of certain consignment sales  and also stipulate that payment is not contingent on the achievement of specific milestones or other substantive performance  the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited commercial experience and lack of evidence of fair value 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue at the time of delivery and recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  which is generally for periods of twelve to thirty months  or over the anticipated service period if expected to exceed the contractual service period 
the costs associated with the product  service and other obligations are generally expensed as they are incurred 
in the case of our limited consignment sales  we do not begin recognizing revenue on a deferred basis until the customer has accepted the product  at which time the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the price is fixed and we have a reasonable expectation of collecting upon billing 
as we gain commercial experience  including field experience relative to service and warranty obligations based on the sales of our initial products  the fair values for the multiple elements within our future contracts may become determinable and we may  in future periods  recognize revenue upon delivery of the product or we may continue to defer recognition  based on application of appropriate guidance within eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or changes in the manner in which we structure contractual agreements  including our agreements with distribution partners 
additionally  our research and development contract revenue primarily relates to cost reimbursement research and development contracts associated with the development of pem fuel cell technology 
the company generally shares in the cost of these programs with cost sharing percentages between and 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized on the basis of hours utilized  plus other reimbursable contract cost incurred during the period 
revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on the basis of percentage of completion 
at december  and december   the company had deferred contract revenue of approximately and  respectively 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we value long lived assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition 
we utilize third party valuation experts in our assessments of the fair values of acquired long lived assets and allocate purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed accordingly 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill  if any  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and  for goodwill  at least annually 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as appropriate 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on the review during the year ended december   we do not believe that there were any triggering events or that an impairment charge is required 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  result in a net deferred tax asset 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or forego a benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
under section of the internal revenue code irc  the use of loss carryforwards may be limited if a change in ownership of a company  as defined by the irc  occurs 
the company has determined that due to transactions involving the company s shares by significant shareholders  a change of ownership has occurred under the provisions of irc section as a result of this change of ownership  the net operating loss amounts have become limited 
accordingly  we have reduced our deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carryforwards and the offsetting valuation allowance during significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and credits which may be carried forward  before they expire 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the recorded valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december  and  our net deferred tax assets have been offset in full by a valuation allowance 
as a result  the net provision for income taxes is zero for the years ended december  and the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement 
table of contents no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions on january  no adjustment of opening balances was required and the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of operations 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon a blend of implied volatility ie management s expectation of volatility and the company s actual historic stock prices over the expected life of the options  which represents the company s best estimate of expected volatility 
expected option life the company s estimate of an expected option life was calculated in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin no 
sab simplified method for calculating the expected term assumption 
the simplified method is a calculation based on the contractual life of the associated options 
risk free interest rate we use the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data 
we re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our product development activities  our ability to commercialize our on site energy products  market acceptance of our systems and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our development programs directed at commercializing our energy products for worldwide use  hiring and training our production staff  develop and expand our manufacturing capacity and continue expanding our production and our research and development activities 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  issuance of additional equity or debt securities or additional borrowings subject to market and other conditions 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
we anticipate incurring substantial additional losses over at least the next several years and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities balances will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents several key indicators of liquidity are summarized in the following table years ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities working capital net loss net cash used in operating activities purchase of property  plant and equipment included in available for sale securities and working capital at december  is million of auction rate debt securities 
the auction rate debt securities are collateralized by student loan debt securities issued by various states  in the united states  or state agencies 
the federal government guarantees the student loans that are collateralizing million of these securities 
these auction rate debt securities are structured to be tendered at par  at the option of the investor  at auctions occurring every days 
the auctions that occurred in january of were successful 
however  the recent disruption in the financial and capital markets has resulted in reduced liquidity of these auction rate debt securities and increased the liquidity risk associated with these securities as the auctions that have occurred beginning in february have not been successful 
each of the auction rate debt securities includes contractual provisions to deal with these events 
the company will continue to receive interest income on these debt securities  however  the interest rates will be at the maximum rate defined for each security 
the default interest rates will be received until there is a successful auction or the company sells these securities in the open market 
scheduled auctions will continue to take place at future pre established dates 
the company  however  is required to hold these auction rate debt securities until there is a successful auction  until the debt securities mature  which would be an extended period of time between and years  or until the company decides to sell these securities on the open market 
given the negative impact of the liquidity situation in the financial markets  as well as the failed auctions that have occurred  the fair value of these auction rate debt securities may become lower than their carrying value  and that difference may be significant 
a continuation of the recent disruption in the financial and capital markets will continue to result in reduced liquidity to the company and may result in impairment write downs on the auction rate debt securities and or realized losses on the disposition of these securities 
we have financed our operations through december  primarily from the sale of equity  which has provided cash in the amount of million 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaling million and working capital of million 
since inception  net cash used in operating activities has been million and cash used in investing activities has been million 
during the year ended december   the company used million in cash for operating activities  generated million in cash from investing activities and received  from financing activities 
net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of a net loss of million offset partially by non cash items  which include million for depreciation and amortization and million in stock based compensation 
cash provided by investing activities consisted of million of net purchases of available for sale securities  offset by million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and million paid for acquisitions  net of cash received 
cash provided by financing activities in the amount of  consisted of cash receipts of approximately  from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by the repayment of loans to general hydrogen shareholders as a result of the acquisition of general hydrogen 

table of contents other significant transactions impacting our liquidity and capital resources have been as follows mergers acquisitions on april   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of cellex  a development stage enterprise  for an aggregate purchase price  including acquisition costs  of million 
the results of cellex s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
cellex  based in richmond  british columbia  develops and commercializes fuel cell solutions that replace the industrial lead acid battery system used today in powering electric lift truck fleets in large scale distribution centers 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
dollars in thousands current assets property  plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets goodwill total assets acquired current liabilities long term liabilities total liabilities assumed net assets acquired the entire million balance of intangible assets has been assigned to acquired technology  which is being amortized over years 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of general hydrogen  a development stage enterprise  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the settlement of million in senior secured loans previously made by the company to general hydrogen  as well as  warrants granted to shareholders of general hydrogen that were valued at million 
the warrants become exercisable when plug power s common stock trades at a volume weighted average price of or more for consecutive trading days 
the warrants carry an exercise price of

table of contents of the million of intangible assets  million has been assigned to acquired technology and million has been assigned to customer relationships  both of which are being amortized over years 
by acquiring both general hydrogen and cellex  leaders in their industry  the company expects to realize significant technological and operational synergies while pursuing high value applications in the material handling market 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company is expected to be a leading provider of pem fuel cell power units for electric lift trucks and is targeting the estimated billion industrial motive battery market 
the acquisitions diversify the company s product portfolio and add new revenue streams from a potentially significant market 
during october  plug power integrated the operations of both companies into one organization 
further  the company anticipates that higher volume product manufacturing activities will be established in plug power s latham  ny facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in government  government backed and interest bearing investment grade securities that we generally hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
the auction rate debt securities are collateralized by student loan debt securities issued by various states  in the united states  or state agencies 
the federal government guarantees million of these student loan debt securities 
these auction rate debt securities are structured to be tendered at par  at the option of the investor  at auctions occurring every days 
the auctions that occurred in january of were successful 
however  the recent disruption in the financial and capital markets has resulted in reduced liquidity of these auction rate debt securities and increased the liquidity risk associated with these securities as the auctions that have occurred beginning in february have not been successful 
each of the auction rate debt securities has provisions to deal with these events 
the company will continue to receive interest income on these debt securities  however  the interest rates will be at the maximum rate defined for each security 
the default interest rates will be received until there is a successful auction or the company sells these securities in the open market 
scheduled auctions will continue to take place at future pre established dates 
the company  however  is required to hold these 
table of contents auction rate debt securities until there is a successful auction  until the debt securities mature  which would be an extended period of time between and years  or until the company sells these securities on the open market 
a portion of the company s total revenue was attributable to our operations in canada 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term inter company transactions with our canadian subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our canadian subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in canadian dollars 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the company s financial results are affected by risks such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
as exchange rates vary  the company s results can be materially affected 
in addition  the company may source inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts
